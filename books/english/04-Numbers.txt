(Numbers 1:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, inside the tabernacle of the covenant. This happened on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had left the land of Egypt. The Lord said:

(Numbers 1:2) 
"Take a census of the entire assembly of the children of Israel, organizing them by their lineages, households, and families. Count all the males, one by one, by their individual names.

(Numbers 1:3) 
Count all those who are twenty years old and older—everyone in Israel who is capable of going out to war. You and Aaron are to count them by their divisions.

(Numbers 1:4) 
And with you there will be a leader from each tribe, representing their own households and families."

(Numbers 1:5) 
These are the names of the men: From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur the son of Sedeur.

(Numbers 1:6) 
From the tribe of Simeon, Salamiel the son of Surishaddai.

(Numbers 1:7) 
From the tribe of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Duel.

(Numbers 1:8) 
From the tribe of Judah, Nahashon the son of Aminadab.

(Numbers 1:9) 
From the tribe of Issachar, Nathanael the son of Zuar.

(Numbers 1:10) 
From the tribe of Zebulon, Eliab the son of Helon.

(Numbers 1:11) 
From the sons of Joseph, the leader of the tribe of Ephraim: Elishama the son of Ammihud.

(Numbers 1:12) 
From the tribe of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

(Numbers 1:13) 
From the tribe of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideon.

(Numbers 1:14) 
From the tribe of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

(Numbers 1:15) 
From the tribe of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran.

(Numbers 1:16) 
From the tribe of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.

(Numbers 1:17) 
These men are the most esteemed of the assembly, the leaders of their tribes and families, the heads of the army of Israel.

(Numbers 1:18) 
Moses and Aaron took these leaders, and then they assembled the entire multitude of Israel. They counted them by their families, lineages, and households, recording the names of each individual, all those who were twenty years old and older,

(Numbers 1:19) 
just as the Lord had commanded them to do. This census took place in the desert of Sinai.

(Numbers 1:20) 
From the tribe of Reuben, Israel's firstborn son, the count was taken. They were enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each head. All the males who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:21) 
numbered forty-six thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 1:22) 
From the sons of Simeon, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each head. All the males who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:23) 
numbered fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

(Numbers 1:24) 
From the sons of Gad, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:25) 
numbered forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.

(Numbers 1:26) 
From the sons of Judah, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:27) 
numbered seventy-four thousand six hundred.

(Numbers 1:28) 
From the sons of Issachar, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:29) 
numbered fifty-four thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 1:30) 
From the sons of Zebulon, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:31) 
numbered fifty-seven thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 1:32) 
From the sons of Joseph—specifically from the sons of Ephraim—enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:33) 
numbered forty thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 1:34) 
From the sons of Manasseh, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:35) 
numbered thirty-two thousand two hundred.

(Numbers 1:36) 
From the sons of Benjamin, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:37) 
numbered thirty-five thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 1:38) 
From the sons of Dan, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 1:39) 
numbered sixty-two thousand seven hundred.

(Numbers 1:40) 
From the sons of Asher, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

(Numbers 2:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, giving them instructions:

(Numbers 2:2) 
The sons of Israel are to set up their tents, each man in his own camp, divided by their regiments and under their own tribal banners. These camps are to be arranged all around the tabernacle of the covenant, facing it.

(Numbers 2:3) 
On the eastern side, towards the sunrise, the tribe of Judah shall pitch their camp, organized by their own divisions. The leader of the sons of Judah will be Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.

(Numbers 2:4) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was seventy-four thousand six hundred.

(Numbers 2:5) 
Immediately next to them, the tribe of Issachar shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Nathanael, the son of Zuar.

(Numbers 2:6) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-four thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 2:7) 
Next to these camps will be the tribe of Zebulun. Their leader is Eliab, the son of Helon.

(Numbers 2:8) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-seven thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 2:9) 
The total number counted in the camp of Judah—which includes Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun—was one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the first groups that will set out when the camp moves.

(Numbers 2:10) 
To the south, the camp of the sons of Reuben will be stationed. Their leader is Elizur, the son of Shedeur.

(Numbers 2:11) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-six thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 2:12) 
Immediately next to them, the tribe of Simeon shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.

(Numbers 2:13) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

(Numbers 2:14) 
Next to these camps will be the tribe of Gad. Their leader is Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.

(Numbers 2:15) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.

(Numbers 2:16) 
The total number counted in the camp of Reuben—which includes Reuben, Simeon, and Gad—was one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the second groups that will set out when the camp moves.

(Numbers 2:17) 
Then the tabernacle of the covenant will move, along with the camp of the Levites, who are responsible for it. The Levites' camp will be positioned in the very center of all the other tribes' camps. Just as they carefully set up their camps, so too they will carefully take them down, each individual following their specific place and designated order.

(Numbers 2:18) 
To the west, the camp of Ephraim will be stationed. Their leader is Elishama, the son of Ammihud.

(Numbers 2:19) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 2:20) 
Immediately next to them, the tribe of Manasseh shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.

(Numbers 2:21) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was thirty-two thousand two hundred.

(Numbers 2:22) 
Next to these camps will be the tribe of Benjamin. Their leader is Abidan, the son of Gideon.

(Numbers 2:23) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was thirty-five thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 2:24) 
The total number counted in the camp of Ephraim—which includes Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin—was one hundred eight thousand one hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the third groups that will set out when the camp moves.

(Numbers 2:25) 
To the north, the camp of Dan will be stationed. Their leader is Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.

(Numbers 2:26) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was sixty-two thousand seven hundred.

(Numbers 2:27) 
Immediately next to them, the tribe of Asher shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Pagiel, the son of Ocran.

(Numbers 2:28) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-one thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 2:29) 
Next to these camps will be the tribe of Naphtali. Their leader is Ahira, the son of Enan.

(Numbers 2:30) 
The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-three thousand four hundred.

(Numbers 2:31) 
The total number counted in the camp of Dan—which includes Dan, Asher, and Naphtali—was one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the last groups that will set out when the camp moves.

(Numbers 2:32) 
This is the grand total of the sons of Israel who were numbered and organized by their armies: six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty fighting men.

(Numbers 2:33) 
However, the Levites were not counted among the fighting men of the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Numbers 2:34) 
Therefore, the sons of Israel did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses. This is how they pitched their tents for camp, and this is how they marched out, each group organized by their divisions, families, and households.

(Numbers 3:1) 
These are the priestly lineages of Aaron, and these are the descendants of Moses. These records begin from the day the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

(Numbers 3:2) 
These are the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab, his firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

(Numbers 3:3) 
These are the names of Aaron’s sons, who were consecrated as priests. Their hands were formally initiated for the sacred office, so they could carry out the duties of the priesthood.

(Numbers 3:4) 
Nadab and Abihu, however, died when they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord in the desert of Sinai. They died without leaving any children. Therefore, Eleazar and Ithamar carried out the priestly duties in the presence of their father, Aaron.

(Numbers 3:5) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 3:6) 
Bring forward the tribe of Levi. Place them before Aaron the priest, so they can assist him and attend to the duties that pertain to worship.

(Numbers 3:7) 
They must also guard the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle of the Testimony and everything pertaining to the ceremonies, to serve the children of Israel.

(Numbers 3:8) 
They will be responsible for all the duties related to the worship in the Tabernacle, and for the service of the children of Israel.

(Numbers 3:9) 
You are to assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, so they can assist them in their service.

(Numbers 3:10) 
But Aaron and his sons, you shall appoint them to oversee all the sacred duties of the priesthood. Any outsider who approaches to perform these duties will be put to death.

(Numbers 3:11) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 3:12) 
Behold, I have chosen the Levites from among the children of Israel, in place of every firstborn male who opens the womb among the children of Israel. So the Levites shall be considered mine.

(Numbers 3:13) 
For every firstborn belongs to me. From the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for myself everything firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They are mine. I am the Lord.

(Numbers 3:14) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying:

(Numbers 3:15) 
Count the sons of Levi according to their ancestral households and families. Count every male from one month old and upward.

(Numbers 3:16) 
So Moses counted the sons of Levi, just as he had been commanded.

(Numbers 3:17) 
These were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

(Numbers 3:18) 
The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei.

(Numbers 3:19) 
The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

(Numbers 3:20) 
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi according to their households and families.

(Numbers 3:21) 
From Gershon came the clans of Libni and Shimei; these are the families of the Gershonites.

(Numbers 3:22) 
Those counted among the males, from one month old and upward, numbered seven thousand five hundred.

(Numbers 3:23) 
These Gershonites would pitch their tents behind the Tabernacle, to the west.

(Numbers 3:24) 
The chief of the Gershonite households was Eliasaph, son of Lael.

(Numbers 3:25) 
Their responsibilities included guarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant, its covering, and the curtains that are at the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 3:26) 
Also, the curtains of the courtyard, and the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard of the Tabernacle, all that pertains to the altar, the ropes of the Tabernacle, and all the vessels of its furnishings.

(Numbers 3:27) 
From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites. These are the Kohathite families according to their clans.

(Numbers 3:28) 
All the males counted, from one month old and upward, numbered eight thousand six hundred. Their specific duty was the care of the sanctuary.

(Numbers 3:29) 
The sons of Kohath would pitch their tents on the south side of the Tabernacle.

(Numbers 3:30) 
The chief of the Kohathite households was Elizaphan, son of Uzziel.

(Numbers 3:31) 
Under their care were the Ark, the table of showbread, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary used for ministry, and the veil (separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies).

(Numbers 3:32) 
And the chief of all the Levitical chiefs was Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest. He had oversight over those who were responsible for the sanctuary’s care.

(Numbers 3:33) 
From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites. These are the Merarite families according to their clans.

(Numbers 3:34) 
Those counted among the males, from one month old and upward, numbered six thousand two hundred.

(Numbers 3:35) 
The chief of the Merarite households was Zuriel, son of Abihail. These would pitch their tents to the north of the Tabernacle.

(Numbers 3:36) 
Under their care were the frames of the Tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its bases, and all its associated vessels and furnishings.

(Numbers 3:37) 
Also the pillars of the courtyard all around with their bases, their tent pegs, and their ropes.

(Numbers 3:38) 
Moses and Aaron, and the males from the priestly lineage of Kohath (Aaron’s sons), made their camp before the Tabernacle, that is, to the east. They guarded the sacred ceremonies of the sanctuary on behalf of the children of Israel.

(Numbers 3:39) 
All the Levite males, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the word of the Lord, by their families, from one month old and upward, numbered twenty-two thousand.

(Numbers 3:40) 
And the Lord said to Moses: 'Count all the firstborn males among the children of Israel, from one month old and upward, and you will have the total number of them.'

(Numbers 4:2) 
Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the Levites, according to their families and their ancestral houses,

(Numbers 4:3) 
Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:4) 
This, then, is the sacred duty of the sons of Kohath regarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant: the Holy of Holies.

(Numbers 4:5) 
Aaron and his sons shall enter when the camp is to move. They will take down the veil that is before the entrance, and with it, they will cover the Ark of the Testimony.

(Numbers 4:6) 
On top of the Ark, they will place a covering of blue material, and then they will put the carrying poles through its rings.

(Numbers 4:7) 
They will also cover the table of the showbread—and its items, and its offerings, and its cups, and its bowls for pouring libations—with a blue cloth.

(Numbers 4:8) 
And over that, they will spread a scarlet covering, which they will then cover with a protective covering of blue skins. Then they will insert its carrying poles.

(Numbers 4:9) 
They will also take the lampstand for the lights, along with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays for wicks, and all its oil vessels, which pertain to its sacred service.

(Numbers 4:10) 
They will wrap all these items together in a blue covering and place them on a cart.

(Numbers 4:11) 
The golden altar, and the garment with which it is covered during divine service, and the anointing oil, and the incense of composition, and all the vessels that pertain to its ritual,

(Numbers 4:12) 
they will wrap in blue coverings and place on the cart.

(Numbers 4:13) 
They will remove the ashes from the altar and then cover it with a purple garment.

(Numbers 4:14) 
And they will place over it all the items used in its service: specifically, the fire pans, the meat forks, the three-pronged hooks, the shovels, and the fire baskets. They will cover all the altar's vessels together with a protective covering of blue skins, and then they will insert the carrying poles.

(Numbers 4:15) 
Once Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all its items, as the camp journeys are completed, then the sons of Kohath will enter to carry them. However, they must not touch the items of the sanctuary directly, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Kohath regarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:16) 
The duty of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, includes the care of the oil for the lamps, and the incense of composition, and the perpetual sacrifice, and the anointing oil. He is responsible for all things within the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the sanctuary.

(Numbers 4:17) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Numbers 4:18) 
Do not allow the multitude of the clan of Kohath to perish from among the Levites.

(Numbers 4:19) 
Instead, do this for them, so that they may live and not die when they approach the Holy of Holies. Let Aaron and his sons go in and assign each one to his specific sacred service and to his various burdens.

(Numbers 4:20) 
They must not enter to see the sacred things that are properly arranged in the sanctuary, lest they die.

(Numbers 4:21) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 4:22) 
Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, according to their ancestral houses and their families.

(Numbers 4:23) 
Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:24) 
This is the duty of the families of the Gershonites: to carry and guard the following:

(Numbers 4:25) 
the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle of the Covenant itself, the covering for it, and the outer blue protective covering which is placed on top of it,

(Numbers 4:26) 
and the hangings for the courtyard, and the curtain for its entrance, and the ropes all around, and whatever pertains to its use and sacred service.

(Numbers 4:27) 
According to the command of Aaron and his sons, the sons of Gershon shall carry and perform sacred service in all these matters. They are not permitted to carry any burden that has not been commanded.

(Numbers 4:28) 
This is the duty of the families of the Gershonites in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and their chief is Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest.

(Numbers 4:29) 
You shall also enumerate the sons of Merari according to their families and their ancestral houses.

(Numbers 4:30) 
Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, all who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:31) 
These are their burdens: the boards of the Tabernacle, and its carrying bars, and its pillars with their bases,

(Numbers 4:32) 
and the pillars of the courtyard all around with their bases, and the pegs, and the ropes. All these vessels and utensils shall be delivered by name—meaning, each item will be specifically assigned for carrying.

(Numbers 4:33) 
This is the duty of the families of the Merarites and their sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant. Their chief is Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

(Numbers 4:34) 
So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the assembly took a census of the sons of Kohath, according to their families and their ancestral houses,

(Numbers 4:35) 
counting all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter into the sacred service of the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:36) 
And those found by number, according to their families, were two thousand seven hundred fifty.

(Numbers 4:37) 
This is the number of the families of the Kohathites, all who perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, whom Moses and Aaron enumerated according to the command of the Lord through Moses.

(Numbers 4:38) 
The sons of Gershon were also enumerated according to their families and their ancestral houses,

(Numbers 4:39) 
counting all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, all who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 4:40) 
And those found by number, according to their families and their ancestral houses, were two thousand six hundred thirty.

(Numbers 5:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 5:2) 
“Command the children of Israel to remove from their camp everyone who has a serious skin disease, everyone who has an uncontrolled discharge of fluids, and everyone who has become ritually defiled by touching a dead body.”

(Numbers 5:3) 
“You must remove both men and women from the camp. This is so they will not ritually defile their camp, since I Myself dwell among them.”

(Numbers 5:4) 
The children of Israel did exactly this; they expelled those people from the camp, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Numbers 5:5) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 5:6) 
“Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or a woman commits any of the sins that people commonly commit, and thereby acts unfaithfully against the Lord, that person is guilty.

(Numbers 5:7) 
They must confess the sin they committed. They must repay in full what they took through their wrongdoing, adding a fifth part (20%) to it, and give it to the person they wronged.”

(Numbers 5:8) 
“But if there is no close relative to receive the repayment, then the payment that is owed must be given to the Lord, and it will belong to the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement offered for that specific offense.”

(Numbers 5:9) 
“Every contribution of sacred offerings that the children of Israel bring to the priest will belong to him.

(Numbers 5:10) 
And whatever anyone offers, it will be for the priest. Indeed, if anyone gives something to the priest, all of it will belong to him.”

(Numbers 5:11) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 5:12) 
“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If a man’s wife has gone away from him and been intimate with another man,

(Numbers 5:13) 
and her husband cannot know about it because the adultery was kept secret and hidden, and there is no witness, and she has not been caught in the act:

(Numbers 5:14) 
but a spirit of jealousy and contention comes upon the husband, and he suspects his wife, whether she has actually been defiled or not:

(Numbers 5:15) 
then the man must bring his wife to the priest, and he must bring an offering for her: a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He must not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, because it is an offering of jealousy, and an offering for a transgression, intended to bring the adultery to light.”

(Numbers 5:16) 
“So the priest will take her and present her before the Lord.

(Numbers 5:17) 
The priest will take holy water in an earthenware vessel and put a little dust from the floor of the tabernacle into it.”

(Numbers 5:18) 
“When the priest has presented the woman before the Lord, he will uncover her head and place the offering of remembrance — the offering of jealousy — upon her hands. The priest himself will hold in his hand the bitter waters, which bring a curse.

(Numbers 5:19) 
Then the priest will make her swear an oath and say to her: ‘If no other man has been intimate with you, and if you have not been defiled by leaving your husband, then you will be innocent from these bitter waters and the curse they carry.’”

(Numbers 5:20) 
“‘But if you have turned away from your husband and been defiled, and you have been intimate with another man:’

(Numbers 5:21) 
‘then you will be subject to this curse: May the Lord make you an object of execration and an example among all your people; may He cause your thigh to waste away and your belly to swell.’

(Numbers 5:22) 
‘May your belly swell up with a tumor and your thigh rot away.’ And the woman must say, ‘Amen, amen.’

(Numbers 5:23) 
“Then the priest will write these curses in a scroll, and he will wash them into the bitter waters.

(Numbers 5:24) 
And he will give the woman the bitter waters to drink. When she has drunk them, if she is defiled and has been caught in adultery, having scorned her husband: then her belly will swell up, and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become an object of execration among her people.”

(Numbers 5:25) 
“But if she has not been defiled, she will be unharmed and will be able to bear children.”

(Numbers 5:26) 
“This is the law concerning jealousy: if a woman turns away from her husband and becomes defiled, and her husband, moved by a spirit of jealousy, brings her before the Lord;

(Numbers 5:27) 
—even if she drinks the bitter waters that carry the curse—if the woman is not actually defiled, she will remain unharmed by these bitter waters and their curse.

(Numbers 5:28) 
But if she has been defiled and caught in adultery, her belly will swell up with a tumor, and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become an object of execration among her people.

(Numbers 5:29) 
This is the law of jealousy, which applies to a husband if he is stirred by a spirit of jealousy against his wife,

(Numbers 5:30) 
or if a woman turns away from her husband and becomes defiled.

(Numbers 5:31) 
Then the man will present his wife to the priest, and she will immediately drink the waters of the curse, and if she is innocent, she will not be found guilty of the sin.”

(Numbers 6:1) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Moses and said:

(Numbers 6:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: If any man or woman makes a special vow to dedicate themselves to the Lord through a Nazirite vow,

(Numbers 6:3) 
they must completely separate themselves from wine and strong drink. They must not drink vinegar made from wine or from strong drink. They must not drink any juice pressed from grapes, and they must not eat fresh grapes or dried grapes. This is a total abstinence from anything made from the vine.

(Numbers 6:4) 
For the entire duration of their Nazirite consecration to the Lord, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, from the seeds to the skin.

(Numbers 6:5) 
During the entire time of their vow, no razor is to touch their head. They are to remain holy by growing out the hair of their head, until the days of their dedication to the Lord are completed.

(Numbers 6:6) 
For the entire period of their consecration, they must not go near a dead body.

(Numbers 6:7) 
They must not make themselves unclean, even if their father, mother, brother, or sister dies. This is because the mark of their God’s consecration is upon their head, making them especially sacred.

(Numbers 6:8) 
Throughout the entire time of their separation for the Lord, they are to be holy to the Lord God.

(Numbers 6:9) 
If someone unexpectedly and accidentally dies next to them, the consecrated head of the Nazirite becomes defiled. On the day of their purification, they must shave their head.

(Numbers 6:10) 
On the eighth day, they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.

(Numbers 6:11) 
The priest will then offer one bird as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. The priest will make atonement for them, for the sin they committed by being near the dead person, and on that day, the priest will reconsecrate their head.

(Numbers 6:12) 
They must then rededicate their days of separation to the Lord and offer a male lamb in its first year as a sin offering. All the previous days of their vow are invalidated, because their consecration was defiled.

(Numbers 6:13) 
“This is the law for the Nazirite: When the days of their consecration are completed, they must be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,

(Numbers 6:14) 
and they must offer their sacrifices to the Lord: a male lamb in its first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; a female lamb in its first year, without blemish, for a sin offering; and one ram, without blemish, for a peace offering.

(Numbers 6:15) 
Also, a basket of unleavened bread made with fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offerings and drink offerings.

(Numbers 6:16) 
The priest will present these offerings before the Lord, performing the sin offering and the burnt offering first.

(Numbers 6:17) 
The priest will then sacrifice the ram as a peace offering to the Lord, along with the basket of unleavened bread, and its accompanying grain offerings and drink offerings as is customary.

(Numbers 6:18) 
Then the Nazirite will shave off the hair of their consecrated head at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They will take the shaved hair, which is a sign of their consecration, and put it on the fire that is under the peace offering.

(Numbers 6:19) 
The priest will take a boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and place them on the hands of the Nazirite after their head has been shaved.

(Numbers 6:20) 
The priest will wave these offerings before the Lord; they are a holy portion for the priest, just like the consecrated breast and the separated thigh are. After this ritual, the Nazirite is permitted to drink wine again.

(Numbers 6:21) 
“This is the law for the Nazirite concerning their vow and their offerings to the Lord, including the hair of their head. This is what they must offer, beyond what their means allow. According to the vow they have thoughtfully made, so they must carry out their consecration.”

(Numbers 6:22) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Moses and said:

(Numbers 6:23) 
“Speak to Aaron and his sons, instructing them on how to bless the children of Israel. Say to them:

(Numbers 6:24) 
May the Lord God bless you and keep watch over you.

(Numbers 6:25) 
May the Lord God make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.

(Numbers 6:26) 
May the Lord God lift up His countenance upon you and give you true peace.

(Numbers 6:27) 
This is how they will invoke My name over the children of Israel, and I, the Lord God, will personally bless them.”

(Numbers 6:28) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Moses after He had finished all His commands, saying:

(Numbers 6:29) 
“This is the offering of the leaders of Israel on the day the altar was dedicated and anointed for its sacred purpose. They brought twelve carts, twelve oxen—one ox for each cart, and one ox for each leader.

(Numbers 6:30) 
And they presented these offerings before the Lord God.

(Numbers 6:31) 
Then the Lord God said to Moses: 'Accept these from them, and they are to be used for the service of the Tent of Meeting. You are to give them to the Levites, according to each one’s specific service.'

(Numbers 6:32) 
So Moses received the carts and the oxen, and he gave them to the Levites.

(Numbers 6:33) 
He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, for their specific duties.

(Numbers 6:34) 
He gave four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, for their specific duties.

(Numbers 6:35) 
But to the sons of Kohath he gave no carts or oxen, because their duty was to carry the holy things of the sanctuary on their shoulders, without any vehicles.

(Numbers 6:36) 
Therefore, the leaders brought these offerings for the dedication of the altar on the very day it was anointed.

(Numbers 6:37) 
On the first day, Nahshon, son of Amminadab, the leader of the tribe of Judah, presented his offering.

(Numbers 6:38) 
His offering consisted of: one silver plate weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver basin weighing seventy shekels, according to the holy sanctuary standard. Both were filled with fine flour mixed with oil, as a grain offering.

(Numbers 6:39) 
Also, one small gold pan, weighing ten shekels, full of incense.

(Numbers 6:40) 
And for a burnt offering: one young bull from the herd, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year.

(Numbers 7:1) 
It came to pass on the very day when Moses completed the Tabernacle, and set it up, and consecrated it with oil, and made all its sacred vessels holy by anointing them,

(Numbers 7:2) 
the tribal leaders of Israel, who were the heads of their ancestral houses and in charge of the numbered men, brought their offerings.

(Numbers 7:3) 
Their offerings before the Lord were six covered wagons and twelve oxen. Two of the tribal leaders offered one wagon, and each leader offered one ox, and they handed them over to the Levites, with each Levite family receiving a portion.

(Numbers 7:4) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 7:5) 
 'Receive these offerings from them, because they will be used for the service of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. You shall give them to the Levites, to each group according to their specific duty.' 

(Numbers 7:6) 
So Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and he handed them over to the Levites.

(Numbers 7:7) 
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to the requirements of their service.

(Numbers 7:8) 
And he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to the requirements of their service, under the direct supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

(Numbers 7:9) 
But to the sons of Kohath, he gave no wagons or oxen; for it was their duty to carry the most holy objects of the Tabernacle on their shoulders.

(Numbers 7:10) 
Therefore, the tribal leaders brought their offerings for the dedication of the altar on the very day it was consecrated.

(Numbers 7:11) 
And the Lord said to Moses, 'Each tribal leader shall bring his dedication offering for the altar on a separate day.' 

(Numbers 7:12) 
So, on the first day, Nahshon, the son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:13) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:14) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:15) 
And a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:16) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.

(Numbers 7:17) 
On the second day, Nathanael, the son of Zuar from the tribe of Issachar, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:18) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:19) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:20) 
And a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:21) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Nathanael, the son of Zuar.

(Numbers 7:22) 
On the third day, Eliab, the son of Helon and leader of the sons of Zebulun, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:23) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:24) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:25) 
And a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:26) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Eliab, the son of Helon.

(Numbers 7:27) 
On the fourth day, Elizur, the son of Shedeur and leader of the sons of Reuben, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:28) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:29) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:30) 
And a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:31) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Elizur, the son of Shedeur.

(Numbers 7:32) 
On the fifth day, Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai and leader of the sons of Simeon, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:33) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:34) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:35) 
And a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:36) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.

(Numbers 7:37) 
On the sixth day, Eliasaph, the son of Deuel and leader of the sons of Gad, brought his offering.

(Numbers 7:38) 
His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.

(Numbers 7:39) 
Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense; and a male goat for the sin offering.

(Numbers 7:40) 
Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.

(Numbers 8:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:

(Numbers 8:2) 
“Tell Aaron these instructions: When you prepare the lamps in the Tabernacle, make sure that the light from the seven lamps shines forward, illuminating the area directly in front of the lampstand.”

(Numbers 8:3) 
Aaron carried out these instructions. He lit the lamps on the lampstand so that they faced forward and illuminated the area in front of it, exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Numbers 8:4) 
This is how the lampstand was made: it was hammered out of pure gold, both its base and its branches, all of it with intricate carved work. The lampstand was crafted exactly according to the design that the Lord had shown to Moses.

(Numbers 8:5) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him further instructions:

(Numbers 8:6) 
“Take the Levites from among all the people of Israel and purify them through a ritual cleansing.

(Numbers 8:7) 
You shall purify them according to this ritual: sprinkle the water of purification upon them. They must shave off all the hair on their bodies; then they are to wash their clothes and cleanse themselves completely.

(Numbers 8:8) 
After this, they are to bring a young bull from the herd, along with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil. You are also to take another young bull as a sin offering for them.

(Numbers 8:9) 
You are to bring the Levites before the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and then you are to assemble the entire community of the people of Israel.

(Numbers 8:10) 
When you present the Levites before the Lord, all the people of Israel shall lay their hands upon them, dedicating them.

(Numbers 8:11) 
Aaron shall then present the Levites before the Lord as a special wave offering from the people of Israel, so that the Levites may perform their service for Me in the Tabernacle.

(Numbers 8:12) 
The Levites, in turn, are to lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. One bull is to be offered as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.

(Numbers 8:13) 
You are to present the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then you will consecrate them as a special offering to the Lord.

(Numbers 8:14) 
Thus, you will separate the Levites from among the rest of the people of Israel, so that the Levites will be exclusively Mine.

(Numbers 8:15) 
After these rituals, the Levites may enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony to serve Me. You are to purify and consecrate them in this manner as a special offering to the Lord, because they have been given to Me as a unique possession from among the people of Israel.

(Numbers 8:16) 
I have accepted them as a replacement for all the firstborn among the people of Israel, for every first male child that opens the womb.

(Numbers 8:17) 
For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are Mine, both of humans and animals. From the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set them apart as holy for Myself.

(Numbers 8:18) 
And now, I have taken the Levites as substitutes for all the firstborn of the people of Israel.

(Numbers 8:19) 
I have given the Levites to Aaron and his sons as a special gift, so that they may perform service for Me on behalf of the people of Israel in the Tabernacle of the Covenant. They are also to make atonement and pray for the people, so that no plague may strike the community if any Israelite should presumptuously approach the Sanctuary without authorization.”

(Numbers 8:20) 
So Moses and Aaron, and the entire community of the people of Israel, performed all these instructions concerning the Levites, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Numbers 8:21) 
The Levites underwent purification and washed their clothes. Aaron then presented them before the Lord as an offering, making atonement for them.

(Numbers 8:22) 
After this, the Levites began their service in the Tabernacle of the Testimony before Aaron and his sons, exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites.

(Numbers 8:23) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him further instructions:

(Numbers 8:24) 
“This is the law for the Levites: from twenty-five years of age and older, they shall begin their service and perform duties in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

(Numbers 8:25) 
But when they reach fifty years of age, they shall no longer serve actively, and they will cease from their regular work.

(Numbers 8:26) 
However, they may assist their younger brothers in the Tabernacle of the Testimony, helping to guard what has been entrusted to them. They shall only perform duties of oversight, but they are not to perform the active service of the Tabernacle itself. This is how you are to regulate the Levites concerning their assigned duties and responsibilities.”

(Numbers 8:27) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him instructions:

(Numbers 8:28) 
“Speak to the people of Israel and tell them: When you enter the land where you will dwell, which I am giving to you,

(Numbers 8:29) 
and you present an offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice, fulfilling vows or making a voluntary offering, or during your appointed festivals—to create a pleasing aroma to the Lord from cattle or sheep:

(Numbers 8:30) 
Whoever offers a peace offering must also present a grain offering with it. This grain offering must be one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-quarter of a hin of oil.

(Numbers 8:31) 
And for the drink offering, they are to provide wine in the same measure as the oil, one-quarter of a hin.

(Numbers 8:32) 
This applies to each individual sheep, ram, goat, calf, and ox, and all other animals that are offered as sacrifices.

(Numbers 8:33) 
According to the number of sacrificial animals, the same proportion of fine flour and wine for the drink offerings shall be given for each one.

(Numbers 8:34) 
Every native-born Israelite and every foreigner who lives among you shall perform these rituals according to the same law.

(Numbers 8:35) 
There shall be one law for you and for the resident foreigner, and the same ordinances shall apply to all.

(Numbers 8:36) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 8:37) 
“Speak to the people of Israel and tell them: When you enter the land of Canaan, and you eat from the food of that land,

(Numbers 8:38) 
you are to set aside the first portion of your dough as an offering to the Lord.

(Numbers 8:39) 
From the first of your dough, just as you give a portion from your threshing floors, so too shall you give an offering to the Lord.

(Numbers 8:40) 
You are to present this first portion of your dough as an offering to the Lord throughout all your generations.”

(Numbers 9:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai desert, in the first month of the second year after the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, saying this to him:

(Numbers 9:2) 
“You, the children of Israel, are to keep the Passover at its proper time.

(Numbers 9:3) 
You must do this on the fourteenth day of that same month, following all of its proper ceremonies and legal requirements.”

(Numbers 9:4) 
So Moses commanded the children of Israel to keep the Passover.

(Numbers 9:5) 
They kept it in the Sinai desert on the fourteenth day of the first month, in the evening. The children of Israel did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Numbers 9:6) 
However, some men were ritually unclean because they had touched a dead body, and so they were not able to keep the Passover on its designated day. These men came to Moses and Aaron,

(Numbers 9:7) 
and they said: “We are unclean because we touched a dead body. Why should we be prevented from offering the Lord’s sacrifice at its proper time, along with the rest of the children of Israel?”

(Numbers 9:8) 
Moses answered them: “Wait here so I can consult the Lord to see what He commands about your situation.”

(Numbers 9:9) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 9:10) 
“Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: If any man among you, or among your descendants, becomes unclean by touching a dead body, or if he is far away on a journey, he may still keep the Passover for the Lord.

(Numbers 9:11) 
He shall keep it in the second month, on the fourteenth day of that month, in the evening. They must eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

(Numbers 9:12) 
They must not leave any of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. They must observe all the ceremonies of the Passover exactly as prescribed.

(Numbers 9:13) 
But if a man is clean and is not on a journey, and still fails to keep the Passover, that person will be cut off from his people. Because he did not offer the Lord’s sacrifice at its proper time, that man will bear the guilt of his sin.

(Numbers 9:14) 
If a resident foreigner or a temporary visitor among you desires to keep the Passover for the Lord, he must do so according to its ceremonies and legal requirements. You shall have the same law for both the resident foreigner and the native-born person.”

(Numbers 9:15) 
Now, on the day the Tabernacle was set up, a cloud covered it. And from evening until morning, there appeared over the Tabernacle something like the appearance of fire.

(Numbers 9:16) 
This is how it remained continuously: by day, the cloud covered it, and by night, it had the appearance of fire.

(Numbers 9:17) 
Whenever the cloud that was over the Tabernacle moved away, then the children of Israel would set out on their journey. And wherever the cloud settled, there they would set up their camp.

(Numbers 9:18) 
At the Lord’s command they would set out, and at His command they would pitch their tents. As long as the cloud remained over the Tabernacle, they stayed in that same place.

(Numbers 9:19) 
If the cloud stayed over it for many days, the children of Israel observed the Lord’s command and did not move on.

(Numbers 9:20) 
If the cloud was over it for only a few days, they remained at the Lord’s command, and at His command they would set out.

(Numbers 9:21) 
If the cloud remained from evening until morning, and then departed in the morning, they would set out. Or if it departed after a day and a night, they would move their camp by following it.

(Numbers 9:22) 
Whether the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle for two days, or a month, or a longer period of time, the children of Israel remained in the same place and did not move on. But as soon as it departed, they would move their camp.

(Numbers 9:23) 
They set up their tents at the Lord’s command and journeyed at His command. They observed the Lord’s commands, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.

(Numbers 10:1) 
The Lord God then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 10:2) 
“Make two trumpets for yourself, made of hammered silver. You shall use them to call the community together when it is time for the camp to move.”

(Numbers 10:3) 
“When you sound them, the entire assembly of people will gather before you at the entrance of the tent of the covenant.”

(Numbers 10:4) 
“If only one trumpet makes a sound, then only the leaders—the heads of the thousands of Israel—will come to you.”

(Numbers 10:5) 
“But if you make a long, repeated sound with the trumpets, then those who are camped on the east side will begin to move.”

(Numbers 10:6) 
“At the second sound, made in the same manner, those who are camped on the south side will prepare their camp to move. And the others will do likewise.”

(Numbers 10:7) 
“However, when the people are to be gathered together, the trumpet sound will be a simple call, not a repeated one.”

(Numbers 10:8) 
“And Aaron's sons, who are priests, shall sound the trumpets. This shall be a lasting ordinance for your generations.”

(Numbers 10:9) 
“If you go out to battle in your land against enemies who are fighting against you, you shall sound a strong call with the trumpets. Then the Lord your God will remember you, and you will be delivered from the hands of your enemies.”

(Numbers 10:10) 
“Also, on your days of celebration, and on your feast days, and at the beginning of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the peace offerings. They will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the Lord your God.”

(Numbers 10:11) 
In the second year, on the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of testimony.

(Numbers 10:12) 
So the sons of Israel began their journeys, group by group, from the desert of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.

(Numbers 10:13) 
The first groups to move their camps did so according to the Lord's command, through Moses.

(Numbers 10:14) 
And so the sons of Judah set out by their divisions. Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, was their prince.

(Numbers 10:15) 
In the tribe of the sons of Issachar, Nethanel, the son of Zuar, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:16) 
In the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, Eliab, the son of Helon, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:17) 
Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and Merari carried it.

(Numbers 10:18) 
Next, the sons of Reuben set out by their divisions and their families. Their prince was Elizur, the son of Shedeur.

(Numbers 10:19) 
In the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:20) 
In the tribe of the sons of Gad, Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:21) 
And the sons of Kohath also set out, carrying the sanctuary. This was so that by the time they arrived at the designated stopping place, the tabernacle would already be set up.

(Numbers 10:22) 
Then the sons of Ephraim set out by their divisions and their families. Their prince was Elishama, the son of Ammihud.

(Numbers 10:23) 
In the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:24) 
In the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, Abidan, the son of Gideoni, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:25) 
Lastly, those who formed the rear guard for all the camps were the sons of Dan, who set out by their divisions. Their prince was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.

(Numbers 10:26) 
In the tribe of the sons of Asher, Pagiel, the son of Ocran, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:27) 
In the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, Ahira, the son of Enan, was the prince.

(Numbers 10:28) 
These were the movements of the sons of Israel, by their divisions, as they set out on their journeys.

(Numbers 10:29) 
Moses then said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, his father-in-law: “We are setting out for the place that the Lord is going to give us. Come with us, and we will do good to you, because the Lord has promised good things to Israel.”

(Numbers 10:30) 
But Hobab replied: “I will not come with you. Instead, I will return to my own land, where I was born.”

(Numbers 10:31) 
But Moses urged him, saying: “Please do not leave us! For you know the places in the desert where we ought to camp, and you can be our guide.”

(Numbers 10:32) 
“And if you come with us, whatever good things the Lord gives to us, we will give to you as well.”

(Numbers 10:33) 
So they set out from the mountain of the Lord, a three-day journey. And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them for three days, providing and searching out places for them to camp.

(Numbers 10:34) 
“And the cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they traveled.”

(Numbers 10:35) 
And whenever the ark was lifted up to move, Moses would say: “Arise, Lord, and may your enemies be scattered! May those who hate you flee from your presence!”

(Numbers 10:36) 
“And when it was set down, he would say: ‘Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel's army!’”

(Numbers 11:1) 
The people began to complain against the Lord, as if they were lamenting their hardship. When the Lord heard this, He became very angry. A fire then ignited among them, consuming the outskirts of their camp.

(Numbers 11:2) 
So the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the Lord for them. The fire was then extinguished.

(Numbers 11:3) 
So the name of that place was called "Burning", because the Lord's fire had been kindled against them there.

(Numbers 11:4) 
But the mixed multitude of people who had come up with them were filled with intense cravings. And the children of Israel also wept, saying: "Who will give us meat to eat?"

(Numbers 11:5) 
We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt! We recall the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.

(Numbers 11:6) 
But now our appetites are dry and weak. Our eyes see nothing but this manna.

(Numbers 11:7) 
The manna itself looked like coriander seed, and its appearance was like crystalline dew.

(Numbers 11:8) 
The people would go out to gather it, then grind it in handmills or crush it in mortars. They would cook it in pots and make cakes from it that tasted like bread made with oil.

(Numbers 11:9) 
And when the dew fell upon the camp at night, the manna would descend with it.

(Numbers 11:10) 
Moses then heard the people weeping throughout their families, each person at the entrance of their tents. The Lord's fury became intense, and Moses himself was also greatly displeased by their behavior.

(Numbers 11:11) 
And Moses said to the Lord: "Why have You afflicted Your servant? Why have I not found grace in Your sight, that You would lay the burden of all these people upon me?"

(Numbers 11:12) 
Did I conceive all these people? Or did I give birth to them, that You should tell me: 'Carry them in your arms, as a nurse carries a baby, and bring them to the land which You swore to their fathers'?

(Numbers 11:13) 
Where can I get meat to give to all these people? For they are weeping before me, saying: 'Give us meat, so we may eat'.

(Numbers 11:14) 
I cannot bear all this burden of the people by myself, because it is too heavy for me.

(Numbers 11:15) 
If You are going to continue dealing with me like this, I beg You, please kill me now—if I have found favor in Your eyes—so I may not see my own troubles and misery any further.

(Numbers 11:16) 
And the Lord said to Moses: "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, men whom you know to be elders and leaders of the people. Bring them to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and have them stand there with you."

(Numbers 11:17) 
And I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit that is upon you and put it upon them, so that they may bear the burden of the people with you, and you will not be burdened alone.

(Numbers 11:18) 
And to the people you shall say: 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for you shall eat meat. For you have complained, saying: "Who will give us meat to eat? It was better for us in Egypt!" Now, the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat it'.

(Numbers 11:19) 
You will eat it not for just one day, nor for two, or five, or ten, or even twenty days,

(Numbers 11:20) 
but for an entire month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes sickening to you. This will happen because you have despised the Lord, who is in your midst, and have wept before Him, saying: 'Why did we ever leave Egypt?'

(Numbers 11:21) 
And Moses said: "There are six hundred thousand footmen among these people, among whom I stand. Yet You say: 'I will give them meat to eat for an entire month'?"

(Numbers 11:22) 
Even if flocks of sheep and herds of cattle were slaughtered, would they be enough for their food? Or if all the fish of the sea were gathered together, would they satisfy them?

(Numbers 11:23) 
To which the Lord answered: "Is the Lord's power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will be fulfilled in action or not."

(Numbers 11:24) 
So Moses went out and reported the Lord's words to the people. He gathered seventy men from the elders of Israel and made them stand around the Tabernacle.

(Numbers 11:25) 
And the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses. He took some of the Spirit that was upon Moses and placed it upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease afterward.

(Numbers 11:26) 
Two men, however, had remained in the camp. One was named Eldad and the other Medad, and the Spirit rested upon them, for they had also been listed among the elders, but had not gone out to the Tabernacle. When they prophesied in the camp,

(Numbers 11:27) 
a young man ran and reported to Moses, saying: "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"

(Numbers 11:28) 
Immediately, Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' assistant and one of his chosen men, said: "My Lord Moses, forbid them!"

(Numbers 11:29) 
To him Moses replied: "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord's people would prophesy, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them all!"

(Numbers 11:30) 
After this, Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.

(Numbers 11:31) 
Then a wind came from the Lord, which swept quails from the sea and brought them to the camp. They were scattered for a distance of a day's journey all around the camp, and lay about two cubits (around three feet) high on the surface of the earth.

(Numbers 11:32) 
So the people rose up all that day, all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. Even he who gathered the least collected ten homers (about 60 bushels). They then spread them out all around the camp to dry.

(Numbers 11:33) 
While the meat was still between their teeth and had not yet been consumed, the Lord's anger was stirred against the people, and He struck them with an exceedingly great plague.

(Numbers 11:34) 
So the name of that place was called "Graves of Craving", because there they buried the people who had craved meat with such intensity.

(Numbers 11:35) 
From the Graves of Craving, they journeyed to Hazeroth and remained there.

(Numbers 12:1) 
Then Miriam and Aaron began speaking against Moses because of his Ethiopian wife. They asked, 'Why did he marry an Ethiopian woman?'

(Numbers 12:2) 
They continued, 'Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us?' The Lord heard what they said.

(Numbers 12:3) 
Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the earth.

(Numbers 12:4) 
Immediately the Lord spoke to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, saying, 'Go out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting.' So they went out.

(Numbers 12:5) 
The Lord descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. He called Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had come forward,

(Numbers 12:6) 
He said to them, 'Hear My words: If there is a prophet among you who speaks for the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.'

(Numbers 12:7) 
But My servant Moses is not like that, for he is most faithful in all My house.

(Numbers 12:8) 
For I speak to him face to face, and plainly, not through dark sayings and riddles. Moreover, he sees the very form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?

(Numbers 12:9) 
And the Lord was angry with them and departed.

(Numbers 12:10) 
The cloud also departed from above the Tent of Meeting. And behold, Miriam was suddenly white with leprosy like snow. When Aaron looked at her and saw she was completely covered with leprosy,

(Numbers 12:11) 
He said to Moses, 'I beg you, my lord, do not hold this sin against us, which we foolishly committed and in which we sinned.'

(Numbers 12:12) 
'Let her not be like a stillborn child, that comes out dead from its mother’s womb with its flesh already half-consumed.'

(Numbers 12:13) 
Then Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, 'O God, I beg You, heal her!'

(Numbers 12:14) 
The Lord answered him, 'If her father had spat in her face, would she not have been ashamed for at least seven days? Let her be separated for seven days outside the camp, and then she will be brought back.'

(Numbers 12:15) 
So Miriam was excluded from the camp for seven days. And the people did not move on until Miriam was brought back.

(Numbers 12:16) 
After this, they moved on from Hazeroth and encamped in the desert of Paran.

(Numbers 13:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 13:2) 
“Send men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am about to give to the children of Israel. Send one leader from each tribe.”

(Numbers 13:3) 
So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, as commanded by the Lord. All of these men were leaders from among the children of Israel. These are their names:

(Numbers 13:4) 
From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, the son of Zaccur.

(Numbers 13:5) 
From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, the son of Hori.

(Numbers 13:6) 
From the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.

(Numbers 13:7) 
From the tribe of Issachar, Igal, the son of Joseph.

(Numbers 13:8) 
From the tribe of Ephraim, Hosea, the son of Nun.

(Numbers 13:9) 
From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, the son of Raphu.

(Numbers 13:10) 
From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, the son of Sodi.

(Numbers 13:11) 
From the tribe of Joseph, representing the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi, the son of Susi.

(Numbers 13:12) 
From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, the son of Gemalli.

(Numbers 13:13) 
From the tribe of Asher, Sethur, the son of Michael.

(Numbers 13:14) 
From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, the son of Vophsi.

(Numbers 13:15) 
From the tribe of Gad, Geuel, the son of Machi.

(Numbers 13:16) 
These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. Moses also changed the name of Hosea, the son of Nun, to Joshua.

(Numbers 13:17) 
Moses then gave them instructions: “Go up through the South, and when you reach the mountainous region,

(Numbers 13:18) 
observe what kind of land it is. Also, observe the people who live there: are they strong or weak? Are they few in number or many?

(Numbers 13:19) 
Are their cities fortified with walls or unwalled? Where do they live—in tents or in towns?

(Numbers 13:20) 
Is the land fertile or barren? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous and bring back some of the fruit of the land. Now it was the season when the first grapes were beginning to ripen.”

(Numbers 13:21) 
So they went up and explored the land, from the wilderness of Zin all the way to Rehob, toward the entrance to Hamath.

(Numbers 13:22) 
They went up into the South and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan, the city in Egypt.

(Numbers 13:23) 
They came as far as the Valley of Eshcol. There, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which two men carried on a pole between them. They also took some pomegranates and figs from that place.

(Numbers 13:24) 
That place was named Eshcol (meaning “valley of the cluster”) because of the cluster of grapes that the children of Israel carried from there.

(Numbers 13:25) 
The explorers of the land returned after forty days.

(Numbers 13:26) 
They came back to Moses and Aaron and to the entire assembly of the children of Israel, in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh.

(Numbers 13:27) 
They brought the fruit of the land to them and to the whole congregation.

(Numbers 13:28) 
And they reported to Moses, saying: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it truly flows with milk and honey, as these fruits demonstrate.

(Numbers 13:29) 
But the people who live in it are very strong; the cities are very large and fortified. Moreover, we saw descendants of Anak there.

(Numbers 13:30) 
The Amalekites live in the south; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites dwell in the mountainous regions; and the Canaanites occupy the area by the sea and along the Jordan River.”

(Numbers 13:31) 
Caleb quieted the people who were murmuring against Moses and said: “Let us go up immediately and take possession of the land, for we will certainly be able to conquer it.”

(Numbers 13:32) 
But the other men who had gone with him as explorers said: “We cannot go up against these people, because they are too strong for us.”

(Numbers 13:33) 
So they spread a discouraging report among the children of Israel about the land they had explored, saying: “The land which we surveyed devours its inhabitants. The people whose stature we observed are exceptionally tall.

(Numbers 13:34) 
There we saw monstrous beings, descendants of Anak—a race of giants. In comparison to them, we appeared like grasshoppers in our own eyes.”

(Numbers 13:35) 
Then the whole congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, and the people wept and cried all that night.

(Numbers 13:36) 
All the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying: “If only we had died in Egypt, or if only we would perish here in this wilderness!

(Numbers 13:37) 
Why has the Lord brought us to this land, only for us to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be led away as captives. Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?”

(Numbers 13:38) 
And one said to another: “Let us appoint a new leader and return to Egypt.”

(Numbers 13:39) 
Upon hearing this, Moses and Aaron fell prostrate before the entire assembly of the children of Israel.

(Numbers 13:40) 
However, Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, who themselves had also been among the explorers, tore their clothes. They spoke to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, saying: “The land which we surveyed is an exceptionally good land.”

(Numbers 14:1) 
So the entire assembly cried out in a loud voice. And they wept all throughout that night.

(Numbers 14:2) 
All the sons of Israel grumbled and complained against Moses and Aaron, saying: "If only we had died in Egypt, or if only we had perished in this desert!"

(Numbers 14:3) 
"Why has the Lord brought us into this land only for us to fall in battle? Our wives and our children will be taken captive there. Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?"

(Numbers 14:4) 
They also began to say to one another: "Let's choose a new leader for ourselves, and then we can return to Egypt."

(Numbers 14:5) 
When Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell face down on the ground before the entire assembly of the sons of Israel.

(Numbers 14:6) 
But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephone—who were also among those who had explored the land—tore their clothing in distress.

(Numbers 14:7) 
And speaking to the whole assembly of the sons of Israel, they said: "The land which we have explored is exceedingly good and bountiful."

(Numbers 14:8) 
"If the Lord is gracious to us, He will bring us into that land and give us that land, which flows with milk and honey."

(Numbers 14:9) 
"Do not rebel against the Lord! And do not fear the people of this land, because we can surely devour them as if they were mere bread. All their protection has departed from them. The Lord is with us, so do not be afraid!"

(Numbers 14:10) 
But when the whole assembly cried out again and wanted to overwhelm Joshua and Caleb with stones, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of testimony before all the sons of Israel.

(Numbers 14:11) 
And the Lord said to Moses: "How long will this people revile Me? How long will they refuse to believe Me, despite all the miraculous signs that I have performed before their eyes?"

(Numbers 14:12) 
"Therefore, I will strike them with a pestilence and consume them. But I will make you into a great and more powerful nation than this one."

(Numbers 14:13) 
And Moses said to the Lord: "But what if the Egyptians hear of this? They are the very people from among whom You brought out this nation!"

(Numbers 14:14) 
"And what about the inhabitants of this land? They have heard that You, Lord, are in the midst of this people, and that Your face is seen among them in the present moment, and that Your cloud protects them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."

(Numbers 14:15) 
"If You kill this people as if they were a single man, then the nations who have heard Your great reputation will say:"

(Numbers 14:16) 
"'He could not bring the people into the land that He had sworn to give them, and therefore He killed them in the wilderness.'"

(Numbers 14:17) 
"Therefore, let Your strength, O Lord, be magnified, just as You swore, saying:"

(Numbers 14:18) 
"The Lord is patient and full of great mercy, taking away iniquity and wicked deeds. Yet He does not declare the guilty innocent, for He visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation."

(Numbers 14:19) 
"Forgive, I beg You, the sin of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have been gracious to them from their departure out of Egypt all the way to this place."

(Numbers 14:20) 
The Lord said: "I have forgiven them according to your word."

(Numbers 14:21) 
"As I live — and the glory of the Lord will fill the entire earth —"

(Numbers 14:22) 
"Nevertheless, all the men who have seen My majesty, and the miraculous signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—and who have tested Me now these ten times, and have not obeyed My voice—"

(Numbers 14:23) 
"they shall not see the land for which I swore an oath to their fathers. Not one of those who have reviled Me shall ever look upon it."

(Numbers 14:24) 
"But My servant Caleb, because he was filled with a different spirit and fully followed Me, him I will bring into this land which he explored. And his offspring shall possess it."

(Numbers 14:25) 
"Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, tomorrow you must turn around and depart into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."

(Numbers 14:26) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Numbers 14:27) 
"How long will this wicked assembly grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel."

(Numbers 14:28) 
"Therefore, tell them: 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'just as you have spoken in My hearing, so will I do to you.'"

(Numbers 14:29) 
"In this very wilderness, your corpses shall fall. All of you who were counted, from twenty years old and above, and who grumbled against Me,"

(Numbers 14:30) 
"none of you shall enter the land over which I raised My hand in an oath to make you dwell in it, except Caleb, the son of Jephone, and Joshua, the son of Nun."

(Numbers 14:31) 
"But your little ones, about whom you said they would become plunder for the enemies, these I will bring in. So they shall see the land that you despised."

(Numbers 14:32) 
"Your own corpses, however, shall lie here in this wilderness."

(Numbers 14:33) 
"And your children shall wander as shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they shall bear the punishment for your infidelity, until your fathers' corpses are consumed and gone in the desert."

(Numbers 14:34) 
"According to the number of the forty days in which you explored the land—a year shall be counted for each day. For forty years, you shall bear the punishment for your iniquities, and you will experience My vengeful justice."

(Numbers 14:35) 
"Because just as I have spoken, so will I do to this entire wicked assembly that has risen up against Me. In this wilderness, they shall waste away and die."

(Numbers 14:36) 
So then, all the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land, and who, upon returning, had made the entire assembly grumble against him by speaking evil about the land—

(Numbers 14:37) 
these men died, struck down by a plague in the sight of the Lord.

(Numbers 14:38) 
But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephone, alone remained alive out of all those who had gone to explore the land.

(Numbers 14:39) 
And Moses spoke all these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned intensely.

(Numbers 14:40) 
And behold, rising early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain and said: "We are ready to go up to the place about which the Lord spoke, for we have sinned."

(Numbers 15:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 15:2) 
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them this: 'When you have entered the land where you will live, the land that I am giving to you,

(Numbers 15:3) 
and you make an offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or a freewill offering, or one presented during your solemn feasts to produce a most pleasing aroma to the Lord from cattle or from sheep:

(Numbers 15:4) 
those who offer the sacrifice must present a grain offering of fine flour. It will be a tenth part of an ephah, mixed with oil, of which the measure shall be a fourth part of a hin.

(Numbers 15:5) 
And they shall give wine for a drink offering of the same measure as the oil for the burnt offering or for the sacrifice. This is for each lamb sacrificed.

(Numbers 15:6) 
If the offering is from rams, they shall offer fine flour, two tenths of an ephah, mixed with oil, one third part of a hin.

(Numbers 15:7) 
And for the drink offering, they shall offer wine of the same measure—a third part of a hin—as a most pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Numbers 15:8) 
But when you offer a bull as a burnt offering, or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a peace offering:

(Numbers 15:9) 
then for each bull, you shall give a grain offering of fine flour, three tenths of an ephah, mixed with oil, half a hin.

(Numbers 15:10) 
And you shall offer wine for the drink offering, of the same measure, as a burnt offering of most pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Numbers 15:11) 
You shall do this

(Numbers 15:12) 
for each bull, and for each ram, and for each lamb, and for each goat.

(Numbers 15:13) 
Both the native-born and the resident alien shall perform these rituals according to the same custom.

(Numbers 15:14) 
If any of the foreigners who live among you wish to offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to the Lord, they shall do it exactly as you do.

(Numbers 15:15) 
There will be one ordinance for you and for the proselytes who are resident aliens; it will be equally acceptable to God.

(Numbers 15:16) 
There will be one law and one judgment for both you and for those who reside as strangers among you.

(Numbers 15:17) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 15:18) 
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them this: 'When you have entered the land into which I am bringing you,

(Numbers 15:19) 
and you eat from the food of that region, you shall set aside the first portions for the Lord.

(Numbers 15:20) 
From the food you eat, you shall offer the first fruits, just as you do from your threshing floors.

(Numbers 15:21) 
You shall give the first portions of your food to the Lord.

(Numbers 15:22) 
Now, if you unintentionally sin and do not observe all the commandments that the Lord has spoken to Moses—

(Numbers 15:23) 
all that the Lord commanded you through Moses, from the day He began to give commandments and thereafter—

(Numbers 15:24) 
and if the entire community has forgotten something and sinned, then they shall offer a young bull from the herd as a burnt offering and a most pleasing aroma to the Lord, along with its proper grain offering and drink offering, as the ceremonies require. They shall also offer a male goat as a sin offering.

(Numbers 15:25) 
And the priest shall make atonement for the entire community of the children of Israel, and they will be forgiven. This is because they sinned unintentionally, and they have brought their incense offering to the Lord along with their sacrifices and drink offerings for their sin.

(Numbers 15:26) 
And the entire people of the children of Israel, and the resident aliens who live among them, shall be forgiven, because it was an unintentional fault on the part of the whole people.

(Numbers 15:27) 
But if an individual person sins unintentionally, that person shall offer a one-year-old female goat without blemish as a sin offering.

(Numbers 15:28) 
And the priest shall make atonement for that person who sinned unintentionally before the Lord. He shall obtain forgiveness for them, and it will be forgiven.

(Numbers 15:29) 
There shall be one law for all who sin unintentionally, both for the native-born and for the resident alien.

(Numbers 15:30) 
But if anyone, whether native-born or a resident alien, acts presumptuously (that is, with arrogant defiance against God), then because that person has rebelled against the Lord, they shall be cut off from their people.

(Numbers 15:31) 
For they have despised the Word of the Lord and made His commandment void. Therefore, that person shall be utterly destroyed and shall bear the guilt of their iniquity.

(Numbers 15:32) 
It happened that while the children of Israel were in the desert, a man was gathering wood on the Sabbath day.

(Numbers 15:33) 
Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the entire community.

(Numbers 15:34) 
They put him in custody, because they did not know what should be done to him.

(Numbers 15:35) 
And the Lord said to Moses: 'That man must surely be put to death. The entire community shall stone him with rocks outside the camp.'

(Numbers 15:36) 
So when they brought him outside the camp, the entire community pelted him with rocks, and he died.

(Numbers 15:37) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 15:38) 
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them that they are to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their cloaks throughout their generations, and that they are to put a cord of blue on the fringe of each corner.

(Numbers 15:39) 
When they see these fringes, they are to remember all the commandments of the Lord. They are not to stray after their own thoughts and their eyes, which lead them to spiritual unfaithfulness by lusting after various things.

(Numbers 15:40) 
Instead, they should remember the commandments of the Lord and do them, and so be holy to your God.

(Numbers 16:1) 
Listen now: Korah, the son of Izhar, who was the son of Kohath, who was the son of Levi— along with Dathan and Abiram, who were sons of Eliab, and Hon, who was the son of Peleth, who was the son of Reuben— these men rebelled against Moses.

(Numbers 16:2) 
Also, two hundred and fifty other leaders from the sons of Israel joined them. These men were respected members of the council and were called by their names during times of assembly.

(Numbers 16:3) 
These men gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and they said: 'It is enough that you two are in charge. The whole community of the people is holy, and the Lord is present among all of them. So why do you elevate yourselves above the Lord's people?'

(Numbers 16:4) 
When Moses heard this, he fell face down to the ground in an act of deep reverence and supplication.

(Numbers 16:5) 
Then, speaking to Korah and the entire assembly, Moses said: 'Tomorrow morning, the Lord will show who truly belongs to Him and whom He has made holy. And those whom He has chosen will be allowed to approach Him.'

(Numbers 16:6) 
So this is what you must do: Korah, and all your followers, take your censers.

(Numbers 16:7) 
Place fire in them and put incense on top. Tomorrow, you will offer these before the Lord. Then, whoever the Lord chooses, that person will be the holy one. You sons of Levi are being much too presumptuous.

(Numbers 16:8) 
Moses also said to Korah: 'Listen, sons of Levi!'

(Numbers 16:9) 
'Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from all the rest of the people and brought you close to Himself to serve Him in the worship of the Tabernacle, performing the duties for the community?'

(Numbers 16:10) 
'And now, are you also claiming the priesthood for yourselves?'

(Numbers 16:11) 
'Because of this, your entire assembly is actually standing against the Lord. For what has Aaron done that you should complain against him?'

(Numbers 16:12) 
Moses sent a summons for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they replied: 'We will not come!'

(Numbers 16:13) 
'Is it not enough for you that you have brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey, only to kill us in this desert, unless you also try to lord it over us?'

(Numbers 16:14) 
'Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us possession of fields and vineyards! Are you trying to blind us as well? We will not come!'

(Numbers 16:15) 
Moses became very angry and said to the Lord: 'Do not accept their offerings! You know that I have never taken even a single donkey from them, nor have I ever harmed any of them.'

(Numbers 16:16) 
Moses then said to Korah: 'You and your entire congregation are to stand separately before the Lord tomorrow, and Aaron will also stand separately.'

(Numbers 16:17) 
Let each one of you take his censer, put incense on it, and offer two hundred and fifty censers before the Lord. Aaron is also to hold his censer.

(Numbers 16:18) 
So each man took his censer, put fire in it, and then placed incense on top. They all stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, along with Moses and Aaron.

(Numbers 16:19) 
Korah had gathered the entire community against them at the entrance of the Tent.

(Numbers 16:20) 
Then the glory of the Lord appeared over the entire community.

(Numbers 16:21) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Numbers 16:22) 
'Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, so that I may instantly destroy them.'

(Numbers 16:23) 
They both fell face down and said: 'Oh, most mighty God of the spirits of all humankind! Will you be angry with everyone for the sin of just one man?'

(Numbers 16:24) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 16:25) 
'Command all the people to separate themselves from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'

(Numbers 16:26) 
Moses then said to the crowd: 'Go away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them, so that you are not swept away in their sins.'

(Numbers 16:27) 
So the people moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at the entrance of their own tents, along with their wives, their children, and all their young and old family members.

(Numbers 16:28) 
And Moses said: 'By this sign, you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things that you see, and that I have not devised them on my own authority.'

(Numbers 16:29) 
'If these men die a natural death, the way all people die, and if they are punished by a common human affliction, then the Lord has truly not sent me.'

(Numbers 16:30) 
'But if the Lord does something completely new— if the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead— then you will know for certain that these men have blasphemed the Lord.'

(Numbers 16:31) 
Immediately, as soon as Moses finished speaking, the ground under their feet split apart.

(Numbers 16:32) 
The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their tents and all their possessions.

(Numbers 16:33) 
So they went down alive into the realm of the dead. The earth closed over them, and they perished from among the community.

(Numbers 16:34) 
All the people of Israel who stood around them, fearing this destruction, fled, crying out: 'Lest the earth swallow us too!'

(Numbers 16:35) 
But a fire also came out from the Lord and killed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.

(Numbers 16:36) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 16:37) 
'Command Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers that are lying in the fire, and scatter the fire from them here and there, because the censers have become holy.'

(Numbers 16:38) 
'For they became holy because they were used by these sinners in their deaths. So order them to be hammered into thin plates and fastened to the altar. This is because the incense was offered before the Lord, and so it became holy, to serve as a sign to the sons of Israel.'

(Numbers 16:39) 
So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which had been used by those men whom the Lord's fire had consumed, and he hammered them into thin plates and fastened them to the altar.

(Numbers 16:40) 
This was done to serve as a permanent reminder to the sons of Israel, so that no unauthorized person— meaning, anyone not from the lineage of Aaron— would dare to approach to offer incense before the Lord, lest a similar fate happen to him, just as it happened to Korah and his entire assembly, exactly as the Lord had told Moses.

(Numbers 17:17:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 17:17:2) 
Command Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers from the burning place, and scatter the ashes far away from this place, because they have become holy.

(Numbers 17:17:3) 
—for they put their lives in danger—those who had sinned. The Lord has shown His favor.

(Numbers 17:17:4) 
And from these censers, they are to make thin plates and fasten them to the altar, because they were offered in the Lord's fire and made holy. Therefore, they will serve as a sign for the children of Israel.

(Numbers 17:17:5) 
No unauthorized person may take up incense to burn before the Lord, nor may they become like Korah and all his company. The Lord had already spoken about this.

(Numbers 17:17:6) 
So Eleazar the priest commanded his son to take the bronze censers in which those whom the Lord's fire had consumed had offered their sacrifice. He was to flatten them into plates and fasten them to the altar.

(Numbers 17:17:7) 
These were to be a memorial for the children of Israel, so that no outsider who is not from the lineage of Aaron would approach to offer incense to the Lord, lest he suffer a fate like Korah. This is what the Lord had said to Moses.

(Numbers 17:17:8) 
Nevertheless, the entire congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron the next day, saying: "You have killed the Lord's people!"

(Numbers 17:17:9) 
When the assembly had gathered against them, and Moses and Aaron saw the congregation's tents were being pulled down by the people, a cloud began to cover them, and the glory of the Lord appeared.

(Numbers 17:17:10) 
Moses and Aaron then entered the tabernacle of testimony.

(Numbers 17:17:11) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 17:17:12) 
"Get away from the midst of this congregation, and I will destroy them immediately." Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in supplication.

(Numbers 17:17:13) 
Moses then said to Aaron: "Take a censer and put fire from the altar upon it. Place incense on it, and go quickly to the people to make atonement for them. For the Lord's wrath has already gone out, and a plague is raging."

(Numbers 17:17:14) 
Aaron did as Moses had said, and he ran into the midst of the congregation. He saw that the plague had already begun among the people. He then offered the incense, performing atonement.

(Numbers 17:17:15) 
And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for them. And the plague was stopped.

(Numbers 17:17:16) 
But fourteen thousand seven hundred people had already perished, in addition to those who had died in Korah's rebellion.

(Numbers 17:17:17) 
Aaron then returned to Moses at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, after the plague had been stopped.

(Numbers 17:17:18) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 17:17:19) 
"Speak to the children of Israel and take from them one rod for each of their ancestral tribes, from all the leaders of their tribes, twelve rods in total. You are to write each man's name on his rod.

(Numbers 17:17:20) 
But you are to write Aaron's name on the rod for the tribe of Levi. Each leader of the ancestral tribes will give one rod for his tribe.

(Numbers 17:17:21) 
You are to place these rods in the tabernacle of testimony, before the ark of the covenant—where I speak with you.

(Numbers 17:17:22) 
The rod that I see sprout, that is the one I have chosen for myself, to put an end to the complaints of the children of Israel that they are grumbling against you.

(Numbers 17:17:23) 
Moses then spoke to the children of Israel, and all the leaders gave him a single rod for each of their tribes and ancestral lines. There were twelve rods, not counting Aaron's rod.

(Numbers 17:17:24) 
Moses then placed the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of testimony.

(Numbers 17:17:25) 
The next day, when Moses returned, he found that Aaron's rod, for the house of Levi, had sprouted. It had put forth leaves, and from its clusters, flowers had already burst forth, which would ripen into almonds.

(Numbers 17:17:26) 
Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the Lord to all the children of Israel. They all saw them, and each man took back his own rod.

(Numbers 17:17:27) 
The Lord then said to Moses: "Return Aaron's rod to the tabernacle of testimony, so that it may be kept there as a sign for the rebellious children of Israel. This way, their complaints against Me will cease, and they will not die."

(Numbers 17:17:28) 
And Moses did exactly as the Lord had commanded him.

(Numbers 17:18:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Aaron: "You and your sons, and your father's house with you, will bear the responsibility for any offense against the sanctuary. And you and your sons together will bear the responsibility for the sins of your priesthood."

(Numbers 17:18:2) 
"Also, take your brethren from the tribe of Levi, from your ancestral line, with you. They are to be joined to you and serve you. But you and your sons are the ones who will serve in the tabernacle of testimony itself."

(Numbers 17:18:3) 
"They will keep watch, according to your commands, over everything that pertains to the service of the tabernacle. However, they must not approach the vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, lest both they and you die."

(Numbers 17:18:4) 
"They are to be with you and keep watch over the duties of the tabernacle and all its ceremonies. No unauthorized person may join you."

(Numbers 17:18:5) 
"You yourselves are to keep watch over the duties of the sanctuary and the service of the altar, so that wrath may not again arise against the children of Israel."

(Numbers 17:18:6) 
"Look, I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel. I have given them as a gift to the Lord, so that they may serve in the ministries of the tabernacle of the covenant."

(Numbers 17:18:7) 
"But you and your sons are to keep your priesthood, and all that pertains to the ritual of the altar and the veil. All things that are done within the sanctuary will be ministered by priests alone. No unauthorized person will approach you."

(Numbers 17:18:8) 
The Lord then spoke to Aaron: "Look, I have given you the responsibility for My sacred offerings. All that is set apart as holy by the children of Israel, I have given to you and your sons for your duty, by a perpetual right."

(Numbers 17:18:9) 
"Therefore, these are what you will receive from those things that are consecrated and offered to Me. All that is set apart by the children of Israel, I have given to you and your sons and daughters, by a perpetual right. You are to eat the most holy portions."

(Numbers 17:18:10) 
"You are to eat them in the sanctuary. Only males may eat from them, because they are holy to you."

(Numbers 17:18:11) 
"But the separated firstfruits of all the gifts of the children of Israel, and their offerings and donations, I have given to you and to your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. Everyone in your household who is clean may eat from them."

(Numbers 17:18:12) 
"All the best oil, and wine, and grain, whatever they offer to the Lord, I have given to you."

(Numbers 18:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Aaron, saying: "You, your sons, and your entire ancestral house with you, will bear the moral responsibility for the purity of the sanctuary. And you and your sons together will be accountable for the sins of your priesthood."

(Numbers 18:2) 
"But also take your brothers from the tribe of Levi—your ancestral tribe—with you. They are to be joined with you and minister to you. However, you and your sons alone will minister in the Tabernacle of the Testimony."

(Numbers 18:3) 
"They will keep watch, obeying your instructions and performing all the work of the Tabernacle. However, they are strictly forbidden from approaching the sacred vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, lest they die, and you too, by allowing such a profanation."

(Numbers 18:4) 
"They will be with you and keep watch over the duties of the Tabernacle and all its ceremonies. No unauthorized person—no one not appointed for this sacred service—may approach you."

(Numbers 18:5) 
"You are to keep watch over the duties of the sanctuary and the service of the altar. Do this so that My righteous anger may no longer break out against the children of Israel."

(Numbers 18:6) 
"For I Myself have given your brothers, the Levites, from among the children of Israel. I have handed them over as a special gift to the Lord, so that they may serve in the ministries of the Tabernacle of the Covenant."

(Numbers 18:7) 
"But you and your sons are to guard your priesthood for all the service of the altar and the veil, and everything that is within these sacred spaces. Through this consecrated service, I have given you the priesthood. Any unauthorized person who approaches these sacred things will surely die."

(Numbers 18:8) 
The Lord then spoke further to Aaron, saying: "Behold, I have given you the charge over the first-offerings of My blessings—all things consecrated by the children of Israel. I allot these to you and your sons by virtue of your perpetually consecrated office."

(Numbers 18:9) 
"Therefore, these are the things you will receive from those that are consecrated and offered to the Lord: every offering, every sacrifice, and whatever is rendered to Me for sin and for trespass, and whatever belongs to the most holy things. This will be yours and your sons'."

(Numbers 18:10) 
"You will eat these in the sanctuary. Only males may eat of them, because they are consecrated specifically for you."

(Numbers 18:11) 
"Also, the first-offerings of all your gifts and everything the children of Israel offer, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. Anyone who is ritually clean in your household may eat of them."

(Numbers 18:12) 
"All the choicest part of the oil, and of the wine, and of the grain—whatever they offer to the Lord as first-fruits—I have given to you."

(Numbers 18:13) 
"Whatever first grows in the land and is brought to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ritually clean may eat of it."

(Numbers 18:14) 
"Every devoted thing—whatever has been consecrated to utter destruction or exclusion from common use in Israel—will be yours."

(Numbers 18:15) 
"Everything that opens the womb of all flesh that they offer to the Lord, whether of humans or of animals, and the firstborn of men and of beasts, will be yours."

(Numbers 18:16) 
"However, for the firstborn of humans, you must receive a redemption price. Unclean animals will be redeemed with money: from one month old, at a value of six shekels of silver, according to the standard weight of the sanctuary. A shekel has twenty *obols*—or *gerahs*."

(Numbers 18:17) 
"But the firstborn of an ox, or a sheep, or a goat, you shall not have redeemed, because they are consecrated to the Lord. You will only pour their blood upon the altar, and you yourselves may eat their meat."

(Numbers 18:18) 
"And this meat will be consecrated to you, just like the consecrated breast and the right shoulder are given to you."

(Numbers 18:19) 
"All the consecrated first-offerings that the children of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. This is an everlasting covenant of salt—a sacred, unbreakable agreement—before the Lord, for you and your sons."

(Numbers 18:20) 
The Lord also spoke to Aaron: "You will possess nothing in their land, nor will you have any inheritance among them, for I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel."

(Numbers 18:21) 
"But to the children of Levi, I have given all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance, for the service by which they minister to Me in the Tabernacle of the Covenant."

(Numbers 18:22) 
"This is so that the children of Israel may no longer approach the Tabernacle directly and thereby incur the sin that brings death."

(Numbers 18:23) 
"Only the Levites will serve Me in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and they will bear their own sins related to this service—meaning they will be held accountable for any failures in their duties. This will be an everlasting sacred ordinance throughout your generations. They will possess nothing else as property, for their unique role,"

(Numbers 18:24) 
"They will be content with the offering of tithes, which I have set apart for their use and necessities."

(Numbers 18:25) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 18:26) 
"Command the Levites, and declare to them: When you receive the tithes from the children of Israel, which I have given to you for your needs, you must set apart from them a first-offering for the Lord. This is to be the tenth part of the tithe you received."

(Numbers 18:27) 
"This will be reckoned to you as an offering of first-fruits, just as if it were from the threshing floor or from the winepress."

(Numbers 18:28) 
"Thus, from all the first-offerings that you receive, present a first-offering to the Lord, and give it to Aaron the priest."

(Numbers 18:29) 
"From all the sacred gifts and tithes, you will consecrate to the Lord the choicest and the very best part."

(Numbers 18:30) 
"And you are to say to them: 'If you eat the rich and choice portions from these offerings, you will not incur sin, because neither you nor your sons will be defiled by eating that which is sacred, provided you have properly offered the Lord's choicest portion beforehand.'"

(Numbers 18:31) 
"You and your households may eat these offerings in any of your dwelling places, because it is your reward for your service in the Tabernacle of the Testimony."

(Numbers 18:32) 
"You will not incur sin concerning this matter—meaning eating the portion given to you—provided you do not profane the first-offerings of the children of Israel, which are consecrated to the Lord. If you profane them, you will surely die."

(Numbers 19:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, giving them this instruction:

(Numbers 19:2) 
“This is the ordinance for a specific offering which the Lord has established: Command the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer that is without blemish, and which has no imperfection, and which has never had a yoke placed upon it.

(Numbers 19:3) 
And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, who shall lead the heifer outside the camp and sacrifice it in the sight of everyone.

(Numbers 19:4) 
And Eleazar will dip his finger into its blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times towards the front of the Tent of Meeting.

(Numbers 19:5) 
Then, in Eleazar’s sight, the heifer shall be burned completely: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its dung shall all be consumed by the fire.

(Numbers 19:6) 
And the priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn dyed twice, and throw them into the fire that is burning the heifer.

(Numbers 19:7) 
Afterward, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; only then may he enter the camp. However, he will remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Numbers 19:8) 
Similarly, the one who burned the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and he too will remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Numbers 19:9) 
Then, a ritually clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer and pour them out outside the camp in a very clean place. These ashes are to be kept by the congregation of the children of Israel to prepare the water of purification for sprinkling—because the heifer was burned as a sin offering to remove uncleanness.

(Numbers 19:10) 
And the man who carried the ashes must wash his clothes, and he too will be ritually unclean until evening. This ordinance shall be a perpetual statute for the children of Israel and for the foreigners who live among them.

(Numbers 19:11) 
Whoever touches the dead body of a human being will become ritually unclean for seven days because of that contact.

(Numbers 19:12) 
Such a person must purify himself with this water on the third day and on the seventh day; only then will he be clean. If he is not purified on the third day, then he will not be made clean on the seventh day either.

(Numbers 19:13) 
Anyone who touches a dead human body and does not purify himself with this mixture of water will defile the Lord’s Tent of Meeting and must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of purification was not sprinkled upon him, he remains ritually unclean, and his uncleanness stays upon him.

(Numbers 19:14) 
This is the law concerning a man who dies within a tent: Everyone who enters that tent, and all the objects within it, will become ritually defiled for seven days.

(Numbers 19:15) 
Any open vessel that does not have a lid or a covering sealed upon it will also become ritually unclean.

(Numbers 19:16) 
If anyone in the open field touches a person who has died naturally, or a person who has been killed, or touches someone dead in any other manner, that person will be ritually unclean for seven days.

(Numbers 19:17) 
For the unclean person, some of the ashes from the burnt offering made for sin must be taken and mixed with running spring water in a vessel.

(Numbers 19:18) 
Then a ritually clean person shall dip a sprig of hyssop into this mixture and sprinkle it on the tent and all its furnishings, and on the people who were in the tent, and on anyone who touched a dead body—whether it was buried, or killed, or merely human bones, or a grave.

(Numbers 19:19) 
And the ritually clean person shall sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day. After being purified on the seventh day, the unclean person must wash his own clothes and bathe himself, and then he will be ritually clean by evening.

(Numbers 19:20) 
But if anyone who is ritually unclean is not purified by this prescribed rite, that person will be cut off from the assembly of the people. This is because he has defiled the Lord’s Holy Sanctuary by remaining unclean, and the water of purification was not sprinkled on him. Such a person remains ritually unclean.

(Numbers 19:21) 
This shall be an enduring, lawful commandment. The person who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes. And anyone who merely touches the water of purification will become ritually unclean until evening.

(Numbers 19:22) 
Whatever the ritually unclean person touches will become ritually unclean; and any person who touches that unclean person will also become ritually unclean until evening.

(Numbers 20:1) 
The children of Israel, the whole multitude of them, entered the desert of Sin in the first month. The people settled in Kadesh, and there, Mary—the sister of Moses and Aaron—died and was buried.

(Numbers 20:2) 
But when the multitude needed water, they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.

(Numbers 20:3) 
They argued with Moses and said, "We wish we had died with our brothers before the Lord!"

(Numbers 20:4) 
Why did you bring the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, for us and our livestock to die here?

(Numbers 20:5) 
Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us to this terrible place? It is a place where nothing can be sown, and there are no fig trees, no grapevines, no pomegranates, and no water!

(Numbers 20:6) 
So Moses and Aaron left the multitude and went to the Tent of the Covenant. They fell face down on the ground, crying out to the Lord and saying, "Lord God, we have cried out to You, saying: Your people are perishing!" And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.

(Numbers 20:7) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 20:8) 
Take the staff, and gather the people—you and Aaron your brother. Speak to the rock in front of them, and it will give them water. When you bring forth water from the rock, the whole multitude and their livestock will drink.

(Numbers 20:9) 
So Moses took the staff from before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.

(Numbers 20:10) 
Then, after gathering the crowds before the rock, Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels and unbelievers! Do you think we can bring water out for you from this rock?"

(Numbers 20:11) 
Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. A great abundance of water gushed out, so much that the people and their livestock drank.

(Numbers 20:12) 
And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust Me enough to show My holiness before the children of Israel, you will not lead these people into the land that I will give them."

(Numbers 20:13) 
This is the Water of Contradiction, where the children of Israel argued against the Lord, and where His holiness was manifested among them.

(Numbers 20:14) 
In the meantime, Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom to say this: "Your brother Israel sends this message: You know all the hardship that has come upon us."

(Numbers 20:15) 
Our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived there for a long time. The Egyptians afflicted both us and our fathers.

(Numbers 20:16) 
And we cried out to the Lord, and He heard us and sent an angel who led us out of Egypt. Now, here we are, in the city of Kadesh, right at the edge of your territory.

(Numbers 20:17) 
We beg you, allow us to pass through your land. We will not go through the fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from your wells. We will travel only on the public road and will not turn right or left until we have passed through your borders.

(Numbers 20:18) 
Edom answered him, "You shall not pass through my land; otherwise, I will come out against you with weapons."

(Numbers 20:19) 
And the children of Israel said, "We will go along the beaten path. And if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay you for it. We only ask that you let us pass through quickly."

(Numbers 20:20) 
But Edom replied, "You will not be allowed to pass." And immediately, he came out to meet them with a vast army and great strength.

(Numbers 20:21) 
Edom refused to let Israel pass through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.

(Numbers 20:22) 
After they moved their camp from Kadesh, they came to Mount Hor, which is on the border of the land of Edom.

(Numbers 20:23) 
There, on Mount Hor, at the borders of the land of Edom, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Numbers 20:24) 
Take Aaron and gather him to his people—meaning, he will die. For he will not enter the land that I have given to the children of Israel, because he was disobedient to My command at the Water of Contradiction.

(Numbers 20:25) 
Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and lead them up to Mount Hor.

(Numbers 20:26) 
When you have stripped the father of his vestments, dress his son Eleazar in them. Aaron will then be gathered to his people—he will die there.

(Numbers 20:27) 
Moses did just as the Lord had commanded, in front of the whole multitude, and they went up Mount Hor.

(Numbers 20:28) 
And when Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, he dressed his son Eleazar in them.

(Numbers 20:29) 
Aaron died there, on the summit of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

(Numbers 21:1) 
When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the south, heard that Israel was coming by the way of the spies, he fought against them and gained a partial victory over them.

(Numbers 21:2) 
So Israel made a solemn vow to the Lord and said, 'If You deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.'

(Numbers 21:3) 
And the Lord heard Israel's prayers and delivered the Canaanites to them. Israel utterly destroyed them and their cities, and they named that place Hormah, which means 'utterly destroyed and consecrated to God'.

(Numbers 21:4) 
And they set out from Mount Hor, taking the road that leads to the Red Sea, in order to go around the land of Edom. The people became impatient due to the long journey and the hardships.

(Numbers 21:5) 
And speaking against God and against Moses, they said, 'Why have you led us out of Egypt, only for us to die in this wasteland? There is no bread here, and no water. Our souls are disgusted by this very light food' —referring to the manna God miraculously provided.

(Numbers 21:6) 
For this reason, the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit them, and many of the Israelites died.

(Numbers 21:7) 
Therefore, the people came to Moses and said, 'We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray that He may take away these serpents from us.' And Moses prayed for the people.

(Numbers 21:8) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Make a bronze serpent, and set it up as a standard. Whoever is bitten, when he looks at it, will live.'

(Numbers 21:9) 
So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it up as a standard. When those who were bitten looked at it, they were healed.

(Numbers 21:10) 
And the children of Israel set out and encamped in Oboth.

(Numbers 21:11) 
From there, they journeyed and pitched their tents in Ije-Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab, towards the eastern side.

(Numbers 21:12) 
And from there, they set out and came to the valley of Zered.

(Numbers 21:13) 
From there they departed and encamped beyond the Arnon River, which is in the wilderness and flows from the border of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the border of Moab, lying between the Midianites and the Amorites.

(Numbers 21:14) 
Therefore, it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: 'As He did at the Red Sea, so He did at the torrents of Arnon.'

(Numbers 21:15) 
The channels of the torrents curved down to the land of the cities, extending all the way to the borders of Moab.

(Numbers 21:16) 
From there they came to the well; this is the well about which the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Gather the people, and I will give them water.'

(Numbers 21:17) 
Then Israel sang this song: 'Spring up, O well! Let the people sing to it.'

(Numbers 21:18) 
This is the well that the princes dug, and which the leaders of the people prepared, guided by the Lawgiver —Moses— and with their staffs. From the wilderness of Mattanah, they went to Nahaliel.

(Numbers 21:19) 
From Nahaliel, they went on to Bamoth.

(Numbers 21:20) 
From Bamoth, they traveled to the valley that is in the region of Moab, on the summit of Pisgah, overlooking the desert.

(Numbers 21:21) 
And Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying:

(Numbers 21:22) 
'Allow us to pass through your land. We will not turn aside through your fields or through your vineyards. We will not drink water from your wells. But we will travel along the King's Highway until we have passed through your borders.'

(Numbers 21:23) 
But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his borders. Instead, he gathered a large army, went out against them into the wilderness, came to Jahaz, and fought against them.

(Numbers 21:24) 
And Israel struck him down with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and up to the children of Ammon. For the boundary of the Amorites at the Jabbok River was a strong and fortified boundary.

(Numbers 21:25) 
So Israel took all his cities and dwelt in the cities of the Amorites, specifically in Heshbon and its surrounding villages.

(Numbers 21:26) 
For Heshbon had been the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon River.

(Numbers 21:27) 
Therefore, people speak in a proverb, saying: 'Come to Heshbon! Let it be rebuilt, and let the city of Sihon be restored!'

(Numbers 21:28) 
For fire went forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, and it devoured Ar of Moab, along with the inhabitants of the high places of Arnon.

(Numbers 21:29) 
Woe to you, Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh —your national god—! He gave his sons who fled, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites.

(Numbers 21:30) 
Their yoke was broken from Heshbon even to Dibon. They perished as far as Nophah and as far as Medeba.

(Numbers 21:31) 
So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

(Numbers 21:32) 
And Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and took possession of its inhabitants.

(Numbers 21:33) 
Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og, the king of Bashan, with all his people, came out to meet them at Edrei and fought against them.

(Numbers 21:34) 
And the Lord said to Moses, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'

(Numbers 21:35) 
So they struck down Og and his sons and all his people until not a single survivor remained, and they took possession of his land.

(Numbers 22:1) 
The Sons of Israel then broke camp and set up their tents in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan River, directly opposite Jericho.

(Numbers 22:2) 
Now Balak, the son of Zippor, saw everything that the Sons of Israel had done to the Amorites.

(Numbers 22:3) 
Moab was greatly afraid and was terrified at the sight of the people because there were so many of them.

(Numbers 22:4) 
So they said to the elders of Midian: 'This people will now consume all of our surrounding lands, just as an ox eats grass down to its roots.' At that time, Balak, the son of Zippor, was king in Moab.

(Numbers 22:5) 
So Balak sent messengers to Balaam, the son of Beor, a diviner who lived by the river in the land of the sons of Ammab, to call him and say: 'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt who now cover the face of the earth, and they are settled directly opposite me.'

(Numbers 22:6) 
'Therefore, come now and curse this people for me, because they are stronger than I am. Perhaps then I will be able to strike them and drive them out of my land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.'

(Numbers 22:7) 
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went, carrying the fee for divination in their hands. When they came to Balaam and told him all the words of Balak,

(Numbers 22:8) 
he answered: 'Stay here tonight, and I will tell you whatever the Lord says to me.' So they stayed with Balaam.

(Numbers 22:9) 
God came to Balaam and said to him: 'Who are these men with you?'

(Numbers 22:10) 
Balaam answered: 'Balak, the son of Zippor, the king of the Moabites, has sent word to me,' -

(Numbers 22:11) 
saying: 'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt and now covers the face of the earth. Come and curse them for me, so that perhaps I can fight against them and drive them out.'

(Numbers 22:12) 
And God said to Balaam: 'Do not go with them, and do not curse the people, because they are blessed.'

(Numbers 22:13) 
Balaam rose early in the morning and said to Balak's officials: 'Go back to your own land, because the Lord has forbidden me to come with you.'

(Numbers 22:14) 
The officials returned and told Balak: 'Balaam refused to come with us.'

(Numbers 22:15) 
Again, Balak sent more messengers, and they were more numerous and more honorable than the first ones.

(Numbers 22:16) 
When they came to Balaam, they said: 'This is what Balak, the son of Zippor, says: Please do not let anything stop you from coming to me!'

(Numbers 22:17) 
'I will bestow great honor upon you, and whatever you wish, I will give you. Come, therefore, and curse this people for me.'

(Numbers 22:18) 
Balaam answered: 'Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not change the word of the Lord, my God, to speak anything, great or small, contrary to it.'

(Numbers 22:19) 
'Please, you also stay here tonight, so that I may know what the Lord will say to me again.'

(Numbers 22:20) 
So God came to Balaam at night and said to him: 'If these men have come to call you, then get up and go with them. Nevertheless, only do what I command you.'

(Numbers 22:21) 
Balaam rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.

(Numbers 22:22) 
And God was angry at him for going. The Angel of the Lord stood in the way against him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and he had two servants with him.

(Numbers 22:23) 
The donkey saw the Angel standing in the road with a drawn sword, and it turned off the road and went into the field. Balaam began to beat it, trying to force it back onto the road.

(Numbers 22:24) 
Then the Angel stood in a narrow path between two walls, where vineyards were enclosed.

(Numbers 22:25) 
When the donkey saw the Angel, it pressed itself against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it. And he beat it again.

(Numbers 22:26) 
The Angel then passed further on and stood in an even narrower place, where there was no room to turn either to the right or to the left.

(Numbers 22:27) 
When the donkey saw the Angel standing there, it collapsed under Balaam, who was riding it. Balaam became even more furious and beat its side with a stick.

(Numbers 22:28) 
Then the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey, and it spoke: 'What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times already?'

(Numbers 22:29) 
Balaam answered: 'Because you have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword, I would kill you!'

(Numbers 22:30) 
The donkey said: 'Am I not your own donkey, on which you have ridden all your life until this very day? Have I ever done such a thing to you before?' He answered: 'No, never.'

(Numbers 22:31) 
Immediately, the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the Angel standing in the road with a drawn sword, blocking his way. And Balaam bowed down, prostrating himself on the ground in worship.

(Numbers 22:32) 
And the Angel said: 'Why have you beaten your donkey these three times already? I have come to stand against you, because your way is perverse and contrary to my will.'

(Numbers 22:33) 
'If the donkey had not turned aside from the road, I would have killed you and spared its life.'

(Numbers 22:34) 
Balaam said: 'I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in my way. Now, if it displeases you, I will turn back.'

(Numbers 22:35) 
The Angel said to Balaam: 'Go with these men, but only speak what I command you.'

(Numbers 22:36) 
So Balaam went with Balak's officials. When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him in the city of the Moabites, which is situated on the border of the Arnon River.

(Numbers 22:37) 
And Balak said to Balaam: 'Did we not send messengers to you to call you? Why did you not come to me immediately? Do you truly believe that I cannot reward you with enough honor?'

(Numbers 22:38) 
Balaam answered him: 'Behold, I am here now. Can I speak anything more than what God puts into my mouth?'

(Numbers 22:39) 
So they went together and came to the city that was on the outermost borders of his kingdom.

(Numbers 22:40) 
So Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and he sent some of the meat to Balaam and to the officials who were with him.

(Numbers 23:1) 
Balaam then said to Balak, 'Build seven altars for me here' — these were for the pagan sacrifices Balaam was about to perform — 'and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for them.'

(Numbers 23:2) 
Balak did exactly what Balaam had told him. He placed a young bull and a ram on each of the seven altars for sacrifice.

(Numbers 23:3) 
Balaam then said to Balak, 'Stay here by your burnt offering for a little while. I am going to see if the Lord will meet me; whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you.'

(Numbers 23:4) 
So Balaam went off quickly. And God met him.

(Numbers 23:5) 
And the Lord spoke to Balaam, putting a specific message into his mouth. The Lord said, 'Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say.'

(Numbers 23:6) 
Balaam returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, along with all the leaders of the Moabites.

(Numbers 23:7) 
Then Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'Balak, the king of the Moabites, brought me here from Aram, from the mountains in the east. He told me, "Come, put a curse on Jacob's people! Hurry, denounce Israel!"'

(Numbers 23:8) 
But how can I curse those whom God Himself has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?

(Numbers 23:9) 
From these high rocks, I see the people of Israel; from these hills, I look upon them. They are a people who will live apart, unique and distinct, and they will not be counted among the other nations.

(Numbers 23:10) 
Who could possibly count the countless descendants of Jacob, or number even a quarter of the people of Israel? May my own soul die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!

(Numbers 23:11) 
Balak then said to Balaam, 'What are you doing? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them!'

(Numbers 23:12) 
Balaam answered him, 'Do I not have to speak exactly what the Lord puts into my mouth and commands me to say?'

(Numbers 23:13) 
Then Balak said, 'Come with me to another place, from where you can see only a part of the Israelites, but not all of them. Perhaps from there you can curse them for me.'

(Numbers 23:14) 
So Balak led Balaam to a high lookout point, the summit of Mount Pisgah. There, Balak built another seven altars and placed a young bull and a ram on each.

(Numbers 23:15) 
Balaam said to Balak, 'Stay here by your burnt offering, while I go to meet with the Lord again.'

(Numbers 23:16) 
And when the Lord met Balaam, He again put a specific message into his mouth. The Lord said, 'Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say to him.'

(Numbers 23:17) 
Balaam returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, with the leaders of Moab assembled with him.

(Numbers 23:18) 
When Balaam announced his return, Balak immediately asked, 'What has the Lord spoken this time?'

(Numbers 23:19) 
Then Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'God is not a mere man, that He should lie; nor is He a son of man, that He should change His mind or regret His decisions.'

(Numbers 23:20) 
Has God said something, and He will not do it? Has He spoken a word, and He will not bring it to pass?

(Numbers 23:21) 
God sees no iniquity in Jacob, and He sees no evil or trouble in Israel to curse them for.

(Numbers 23:22) 
The Lord their God is with them, and the joyful shout of their King's triumph is heard among them.

(Numbers 23:23) 
For there is no magic spell that can work against Jacob, nor any divination that can succeed against Israel.

(Numbers 23:24) 
At the proper time, it will be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what great things God has accomplished for them!'

(Numbers 23:25) 
Balak said to Balaam, 'What is this you are doing? You are neither cursing them, nor are you blessing them!'

(Numbers 23:26) 
Balaam answered him, 'Did I not tell you that whatever the Lord commands, that is what I must speak?'

(Numbers 23:27) 
Then Balak said to him, 'Come, I will lead you to yet another place. Perhaps from there, it will finally please God to let you curse them for me.'

(Numbers 23:28) 
So Balak led Balaam to the very top of Mount Peor, which overlooks the desolate wilderness.

(Numbers 23:29) 
Balaam said to Balak, 'Build seven more altars for me here, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams again.'

(Numbers 23:30) 
Balak did exactly as Balaam had earnestly requested, placing a young bull and a ram on each of the altars.

(Numbers 23:31) 
When Balaam saw that it truly pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he no longer went off by himself, as was his custom, to seek divination or omens. Instead, he fixed his gaze toward the wilderness,

(Numbers 23:32) 
and as he looked up, he saw Israel encamped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God powerfully came upon him,

(Numbers 23:33) 
and Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'This is the declaration of Balaam, son of Beor; the declaration of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened by God;'

(Numbers 23:34) 
He declares what he heard of the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty while in a trance, receiving divine light and revelation.

(Numbers 23:35) 
How beautiful are your dwelling places, O Jacob! How lovely are your tents, O Israel!

(Numbers 23:36) 
They are like lush valleys stretching out, like gardens beside flowing rivers, like the tents that the Lord Himself has pitched, like cedar trees standing tall by abundant waters.

(Numbers 23:37) 
Water will flow abundantly from their buckets, and their descendants will spread out like abundant waters, growing and multiplying.

(Numbers 23:38) 
Their king shall be more exalted than Agag—a symbol of powerful, hostile rulers—and his kingdom shall be lifted up in greatness.

(Numbers 23:39) 
God brought them out of Egypt, and His strength is like the immense power of a wild ox.

(Numbers 23:40) 
They shall devour the nations that are their enemies, they shall crush their bones, and pierce them through with their arrows.

(Numbers 24:1) 
Balaam realized that the Lord intended to bless Israel. So, unlike his previous attempts, he did not go out to look for omens or divination; instead, he directed his gaze towards the wilderness.

(Numbers 24:2) 
He lifted his eyes and saw Israel encamped, tribe by tribe. Then, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him.

(Numbers 24:3) 
He then delivered his prophetic message, saying:

(Numbers 24:4) 
“This is the oracle of Balaam, son of Beor. This is the oracle of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened.”

(Numbers 24:5) 
“This is the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees visions from the Almighty. He falls into a trance, yet his spiritual eyes are opened to divine revelations.”

(Numbers 24:6) 
“How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, and your dwellings, O Israel.”

(Numbers 24:7) 
“They are like shaded valleys, like gardens beside flowing rivers. They are like the dwellings the Lord Himself has set up, like cedars growing near abundant waters.”

(Numbers 24:8) 
“Water will flow from his buckets, ensuring abundant prosperity. His offspring will spread widely, like many waters. His king will be exalted above Agag, and his kingdom will be lifted high.”

(Numbers 24:9) 
“He lies down like a lion, and like a lioness, none dare awaken him. Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.”

(Numbers 24:10) 
Enraged, Balak clapped his hands in anger at Balaam and said, “I called you to curse my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them these three times!”

(Numbers 24:11) 
“Therefore, flee back to your own home! I had promised you great honor, but the Lord Himself has deprived you of that honor.”

(Numbers 24:12) 
Balaam answered, “Did I not tell your messengers, whom you sent to me before, saying:”

(Numbers 24:13) 
“‘Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the command of the Lord my God to speak anything, whether small or great, on my own authority. I can only speak what God says.’”

(Numbers 24:14) 
“Nevertheless, now I am going back to my own people. But first, I will advise you on what this people, Israel, will do to your people in the last days.”

(Numbers 24:15) 
Then he delivered his prophetic message once more, saying: “This is the oracle of Balaam, son of Beor. This is the oracle of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened.”

(Numbers 24:16) 
“This is the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who understands the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees visions from the Almighty. He falls into a trance, yet his eyes remain open to divine revelations.”

(Numbers 24:17) 
“I see him, but not in this present time. I behold him, but not nearby. A star will rise from Jacob, and a scepter will emerge from Israel. He will crush the leaders of Moab and destroy all the sons of Seth.”

(Numbers 24:18) 
“Edom will become his possession, and Seir will be his inheritance. Israel will act with great strength.”

(Numbers 24:19) 
“From Jacob will come a ruler who will destroy the remnant that survives from the city.”

(Numbers 24:20) 
When Balaam saw Amalek, he delivered his prophetic message, saying: “Amalek was once the foremost among the nations, but its end will be utter destruction.”

(Numbers 24:21) 
He also saw the Kenites, and delivering his prophetic message, he said: “How strong is your dwelling place! You have set your nest securely in the rock.”

(Numbers 24:22) 
“Nevertheless, you too will be plundered and carried away, until Asshur takes you captive.”

(Numbers 24:23) 
And again, he delivered his prophetic message, saying: “Alas! Who will survive when God brings these things to pass?”

(Numbers 24:24) 
“Warships will come from Italy, and they will afflict Asshur and also the Hebrews. And they themselves, the invaders, will perish in the end.”

(Numbers 24:25) 
Then Balaam rose up and returned to his own place. Balak also departed by the way he had come.

(Numbers 25:1) 
The people of Israel settled in the region of Sittim, and they committed grave sin by engaging in fornication with the daughters of Moab.

(Numbers 25:2) 
These women then invited the Israelite men to the sacrifices offered to their pagan gods. And the Israelite men ate the sacrificial food and worshipped these false gods.

(Numbers 25:3) 
In this way, Israel consecrated themselves to Baal-Peor, a false god of the Moabites. Because of this, the Lord became very angry with them.

(Numbers 25:4) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: 'Take all the leaders of the people who have committed this sin, and execute them publicly before the sun, by hanging them up for all to see. Do this so that my fierce anger may be turned away from the people of Israel.'

(Numbers 25:5) 
And so, Moses said to the judges of Israel: 'Let each of you, with your own hand, kill those among your kinsmen who have consecrated themselves to Baal-Peor.'

(Numbers 25:6) 
And behold, while Moses and the entire assembly of the sons of Israel were weeping in repentance at the entrance of the tabernacle, one of the sons of Israel went openly before his brothers to a Midianite prostitute.

(Numbers 25:7) 
When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron the priest, saw this sinful act, he rose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand.

(Numbers 25:8) 
He followed the Israelite man into the tent where the sin was being committed, and he pierced both of them through at the same time—the man and the woman, right through their reproductive organs. Immediately, the plague among the sons of Israel stopped.

(Numbers 25:9) 
Before the plague stopped, twenty-four thousand people had been killed.

(Numbers 25:10) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 25:11) 
'Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my divine wrath away from the sons of Israel. He did this because he was stirred up with my own divine zeal against them. And because of his action, I did not destroy the sons of Israel as I was angry enough to do.'

(Numbers 25:12) 
'Therefore, tell him: Behold, I am giving him my covenant of peace.'

(Numbers 25:13) 
'This covenant will be for him and for his descendants after him, a perpetual covenant of the priesthood. This is because he was zealous for his God, and in doing so, he made atonement for the wickedness of the sons of Israel.'

(Numbers 25:14) 
Now the name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite prostitute was Zimri, the son of Salu. He was a leader of a family and a tribe within Simeon.

(Numbers 25:15) 
And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed with him was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, who was a noble chieftain of the Midianites.

(Numbers 25:16) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 25:17) 
'Consider the Midianites your enemies, and you must strike them down.'

(Numbers 25:18) 
'You must strike them down because they also acted hostilely against you. They deceived you through the idol Peor, and through Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, who was one of their own, and who was killed on the day of the plague because of the wickedness involving Peor.'

(Numbers 26:1) 
After that great plague, in which so many had died, the Lord God spoke to Moses and to Eleazar, Aaron’s son, who was the priest.

(Numbers 26:2) 
Take a census of all the people of Israel, starting from twenty years old and upwards, counting them according to their family lines and households. Include everyone who is able to go out to war.

(Numbers 26:3) 
So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, to all those who were twenty years old and upwards, just as the Lord God had commanded them.

(Numbers 26:4) 
These are the names of the sons of Israel, who had come out of the land of Egypt. Reuben was the firstborn of Israel.

(Numbers 26:5) 
The sons of Reuben were: Hanoch, from whom came the family of the Hanochites; Pallu, from whom came the family of the Palluites;

These were the families of the tribe of Reuben. Their registered number was forty-three thousand, seven hundred and thirty men.

(Numbers 26:8) 
The son of Pallu was Eliab.

(Numbers 26:9) 
The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were prominent leaders in the assembly, and who rebelled against Moses and Aaron during Korah’s rebellion, when they rebelled against the Lord God.

(Numbers 26:10) 
The earth then opened up and swallowed them and Korah, in the midst of their destruction, at the time when the fire consumed two hundred and fifty men. That was a great and fearsome warning from God.

(Numbers 26:11) 
However, the sons of Korah did not die.

(Numbers 26:12) 
The sons of Simeon, according to their families, were: Nemuel, from whom came the family of the Nemuelites; Jamin, from whom came the family of the Jaminites; Jachin, from whom came the family of the Jachinites;

The sons of Manasseh were: Machir, from whom came the family of the Machirites. Machir was the father of Gilead, from whom came the family of the Gileadites.

(Numbers 26:30) 
These are the sons of Gilead: Iezer, from whom came the family of the Iezerites; and Helek, from whom came the family of the Helekites;

(Numbers 26:31) 
Asriel, from whom came the family of the Asrielites; and Shechem, from whom came the family of the Shechemites;

(Numbers 26:32) 
Shemida, from whom came the family of the Shemidaites; and Hepher, from whom came the family of the Hepherites.

(Numbers 26:33) 
Moreover, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, had no sons, but only daughters. Their names were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman, from whom came the families of the Ardites and the Naamanites. These were the families of Benjamin, according to their families. Their registered number was forty-five thousand, six hundred men.

(Numbers 27:1) 
The daughters of Zelophehad approached. He was the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph. These were their names: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

(Numbers 27:2) 
They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people at the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and they spoke:

(Numbers 27:3) 
Our father died in the desert. He was not among those who rebelled against the Lord with Korah. Instead, he died for his own sins, just like all of his generation in the desert. He had no sons.

(Numbers 27:4) 
Why should our father's name be cut off from his family just because he had no son? Give us a land inheritance among our father’s relatives.

(Numbers 27:5) 
So Moses brought their legal case before the Lord for judgment.

(Numbers 27:6) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 27:7) 
The daughters of Zelophehad are speaking correctly. Give them a land inheritance among their father’s relatives, and let them inherit his portion of the land.

(Numbers 27:8) 
Also, you must speak to the sons of Israel regarding this law: If a man dies without a son, his inheritance will pass to his daughter.

(Numbers 27:9) 
If he has no daughter, then his brothers will inherit from him.

(Numbers 27:10) 
But if he has no brothers, you will give his inheritance to his father's relatives.

(Numbers 27:11) 
And if his father also has no relatives, then the inheritance will be given to those who are nearest to him in family relationship. This will be a holy and permanent law for the sons of Israel.

(Numbers 27:12) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: "Go up this Abarim mountain, and from there, look at the land that I am about to give to the sons of Israel."

(Numbers 27:13) 
When you have seen it, you will be gathered to your ancestors in death, just as your brother Aaron was gathered.

(Numbers 27:14) 
This is because you offended Me in the Desert of Sin during the contention of the multitude, and you did not show My holiness before the people at the waters.

(Numbers 27:15) 
And Moses responded:

(Numbers 27:16) 
"May the Lord, the God of the spirits of all humankind, appoint a man to be over this multitude of people."

(Numbers 27:17) 
"Let this man go out before them and come in before them, and let him lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the Lord may not be like sheep without a shepherd."

(Numbers 27:18) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: "Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom the Spirit is present, and lay your hand upon him."

(Numbers 27:19) 
"He will stand before Eleazar the priest and all the assembly of the sons of Israel. You are to give him instructions in the hearing of everyone."

(Numbers 27:20) 
"And you will give him some of your authority and honor, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him."

(Numbers 27:21) 
"If anything needs to be done, Eleazar the priest will consult the Lord for him, using the Urim and Thummim. Joshua, and all the sons of Israel with him, along with the rest of the multitude, will go out and come in according to Eleazar's judgment and divine answers from the Lord."

(Numbers 27:22) 
So Moses did just as the Lord had commanded. He took Joshua and presented him before Eleazar the priest and all the assembly of the people.

(Numbers 27:23) 
And Moses laid his hands on Joshua's head, ordaining him just as the Lord had commanded.

(Numbers 28:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying to him:

(Numbers 28:2) 
“Command the children of Israel and tell them: ‘You must offer my sacred gifts to me at their appointed times. These offerings include the bread and the burnt sacrifices that produce a pleasing aroma.’”

(Numbers 28:3) 
“These are the sacrifices you must offer: two perfect, year-old male lambs each day as a perpetual burnt offering.”

(Numbers 28:4) 
“One lamb in the morning, and the other in the evening.”

(Numbers 28:5) 
“And for the grain offering, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of pure olive oil.”

(Numbers 28:6) 
“This is the perpetual burnt offering, the same as what you offered on Mount Sinai, which produced a pleasing aroma and was a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord.”

(Numbers 28:7) 
“For their drink offerings, you must pour out a quarter of a hin of strong wine for each lamb in the Lord's sanctuary.”

(Numbers 28:8) 
“And you will offer the other lamb in the evening, according to the ritual of the morning sacrifice and its drink offerings—you must offer them both together.”

(Numbers 28:9) 
“On the Sabbath day, you must offer two perfect, year-old male lambs, along with two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil, as a grain offering, and its drink offerings.”

(Numbers 28:10) 
“These are the burnt offerings for each Sabbath, in addition to the regular daily burnt offering and its drink offering.”

(Numbers 28:11) 
“Also, at the beginning of each month—on the New Moon—you must offer a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”

(Numbers 28:12) 
“And for the grain offering with each bull, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil. And with the one ram, two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil.”

(Numbers 28:13) 
“And with each lamb, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil. This is a burnt offering that produces a pleasing aroma, a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord.”

(Numbers 28:14) 
“Their drink offerings will be as follows: half a hin of wine for each bull, a third of a hin for the ram, and a quarter of a hin for each lamb. This will be the perpetual burnt offering that you must offer each month throughout the year.”

(Numbers 28:15) 
“And you must also offer one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its drink offerings.”

(Numbers 28:16) 
“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the Lord's Passover.”

(Numbers 28:17) 
“And on the fifteenth day of that same month, there will be a solemn feast. For seven days, unleavened bread must be eaten.”

(Numbers 28:18) 
“On the first day of this feast, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work.”

(Numbers 28:19) 
“You must offer a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”

(Numbers 28:20) 
“And for their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, and two-tenths of an ephah for the ram.”

(Numbers 28:21) 
“And for each of the seven lambs, one-tenth of an ephah.”

(Numbers 28:22) 
“And one male goat as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.”

(Numbers 28:23) 
“You must offer these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering.”

(Numbers 28:24) 
“In this same way, you must offer all of these, for seven days, each day, as a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord, a pleasing aroma. This is in addition to the daily burnt offering and its drink offerings.”

(Numbers 28:25) 
“And on the seventh day, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work.”

(Numbers 28:26) 
“Also, on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord after your weeks have passed, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work on it.”

(Numbers 28:27) 
“You must offer a burnt offering that produces a pleasing aroma to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”

(Numbers 28:28) 
“And for their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, and two-tenths of an ephah for the ram.”

(Numbers 28:29) 
“And one-tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs.”

(Numbers 28:30) 
“Also, one male goat, which is to be sacrificed as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.”

(Numbers 28:31) 
“You must offer all of these, along with the perpetual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offerings, making sure they are all perfect.”

(Numbers 29:1) 
In the seventh month of the year, on the first day of that month, you shall have a holy festival. No work of any kind that makes you a servant of anyone but God shall be done on that day, because it is the Day of Trumpets, a day of loud blasts and shofar calls.

(Numbers 29:2) 
And you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord, which is a sweet aroma to Him. This offering shall consist of one young bull from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:3) 
Along with these, for the meal offering that accompanies them, you shall prepare three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for each young bull. And for each ram, you shall prepare two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.

(Numbers 29:4) 
And for each of the seven male lambs, you shall prepare one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.

(Numbers 29:5) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering, so that atonement may be made for you.

(Numbers 29:6) 
These offerings are in addition to the monthly burnt offering and its associated meal offering. They are also in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering and its meal offering, along with their usual drink offerings. All these offerings are to be made according to their prescribed ritual and are a sweet aroma to the Lord.

(Numbers 29:7) 
On the tenth day of this seventh month, you shall have a holy and solemn assembly— this is the Day of Atonement. You shall humble yourselves by fasting and repentance, and you shall do no work of any kind that makes you a servant of anyone but God on that day.

(Numbers 29:8) 
Then you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord, which is a sweet aroma to Him: one young bull from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:9) 
For the meal offering that accompanies them, you shall prepare three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for each young bull, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour prepared in the same way for each ram.

(Numbers 29:10) 
And one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for each of the seven male lambs.

(Numbers 29:11) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering. This is in addition to the sin offering regularly made for atonement, and in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering, its meal offering, and their drink offerings.

(Numbers 29:12) 
On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, you shall have another holy and solemn assembly— this is the Feast of Tabernacles. You shall do no work of any kind that makes you a servant of anyone but God on that day, but you shall celebrate the Lord's festival for seven days.

(Numbers 29:13) 
You shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord, which is a sweet aroma to Him: thirteen young bulls from the herd, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:14) 
For the meal offering that accompanies them, you shall prepare three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for each young bull, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for each ram.

(Numbers 29:15) 
And one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for each of the fourteen male lambs.

(Numbers 29:16) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering. This is in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering, its meal offering, and its drink offering.

(Numbers 29:17) 
On the second day of the festival, you shall offer twelve young bulls from the herd, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:18) 
And for their meal offerings and drink offerings, these shall be prepared for each individual young bull, ram, and lamb, according to their prescribed number and ritual.

(Numbers 29:19) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering. This is in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering, its meal offering, and its drink offering.

(Numbers 29:20) 
On the third day of the festival, you shall offer eleven young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:21) 
And for their meal offerings and drink offerings, these shall be prepared for each individual young bull, ram, and lamb, according to their prescribed number and ritual.

And for their meal offerings and drink offerings, these shall be prepared for each individual young bull, ram, and lamb, according to their prescribed number and ritual.

(Numbers 29:26) 
On the fifth day of the festival, you shall offer nine young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:29) 
On the sixth day of the festival, you shall offer eight young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:32) 
On the seventh day of the festival, you shall offer seven young bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

And for their meal offerings and drink offerings, these shall be prepared for each individual young bull, ram, and lamb, according to their prescribed number and ritual.

(Numbers 29:34) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering. This is in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering, its meal offering, and its drink offering.

(Numbers 29:35) 
On the eighth day of the festival, you shall have a sacred and solemn assembly. This marks the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles. You shall do no work of any kind that makes you a servant of anyone but God on that day.

(Numbers 29:36) 
You shall then offer a burnt offering to the Lord, which is a sweet aroma to Him: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs, each a year old and without blemish.

(Numbers 29:37) 
And for their meal offerings and drink offerings, these shall be prepared for each individual young bull, ram, and lamb, according to their prescribed number and ritual.

(Numbers 29:38) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering. This is in addition to the daily perpetual burnt offering, its meal offering, and its drink offering.

(Numbers 29:39) 
These are the offerings you shall present to the Lord during your appointed festivals. They are to be offered in addition to any votive offerings, which are pledges made to God, and any freewill offerings, which are given voluntarily, whether they are burnt offerings, meal offerings, drink offerings, or peace offerings.

(Numbers 29:40) 
And so Moses explained to the children of Israel everything that the Lord had commanded him to tell them.

(Numbers 30:1) 
Moses then spoke to the leaders of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the directive which the Lord has commanded:"

(Numbers 30:2) 
"If any man makes a vow to the Lord, or binds himself by a sworn oath, he must not break his promise. Instead, he must fulfill everything that he has spoken with his own mouth."

(Numbers 30:3) 
"If any woman makes a vow to the Lord, and binds herself by an oath, while she is a young woman living in her father's household:"

(Numbers 30:4) 
"If her father learns of the vow his daughter has made, and the oath by which she has bound herself, and he remains silent about it—then she will be held accountable for her vow, and she must carry out everything she has promised."

(Numbers 30:5) 
"But if her father hears about it and immediately forbids it, then her vows and oaths will be invalid; she will not be bound by anything, because her father has forbidden it."

(Numbers 30:6) 
"If a woman takes a husband, and she has made a vow, or has let something pass from her mouth by which she binds herself by an oath:"

(Numbers 30:7) 
"If her husband, upon hearing it, remains silent and does not forbid it on the day he hears it, then the woman who made the vow will be held accountable for it; she must fulfill whatever she has promised."

(Numbers 30:8) 
"But if, as soon as he hears it, her husband forbids it and invalidates her vow and the word that had come from her mouth, then the Lord will be merciful to her, and she will not be held accountable."

(Numbers 30:9) 
"Any vow made by a widow or a divorced woman, whatever she has spoken from her mouth, will be binding and valid."

(Numbers 30:10) 
"If a woman makes a vow while living in her husband's house, and binds herself with an oath:"

(Numbers 30:11) 
"If her husband hears it, and remains silent, and does not forbid the promise, then she will be held accountable for her vow, and she must fulfill it."

(Numbers 30:12) 
"But if, upon hearing it, her husband immediately invalidates her vows and the words by which she had bound her soul, then they will be void; and the Lord will be merciful to her, so she will not be bound."

(Numbers 30:13) 
"All vows and oaths by which a woman has consecrated herself or bound her soul will be subject to her husband's decision, whether they are to be valid or invalidated."

(Numbers 30:14) 
"If her husband hears it, and remains silent, and postpones action until the next day, then the woman's vows will be binding, and she must fulfill her oaths. This is because he heard them and remained silent."

(Numbers 30:15) 
"But if he immediately forbids it, he will invalidate her vows, and the words spoken from her lips, and the oaths by which she had bound her soul. Then the Lord will be merciful to her, and she will be free from the obligation."

(Numbers 30:16) 
"This is the law concerning vows, which the Lord established for Moses: defining the relationship between a husband and wife, and between a father and his daughter who is a young woman, still living in her father's household."

(Numbers 31:1) 
The Lord God then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 31:2) 
"You must exact vengeance for the children of Israel against the Midianites. After you do this, you will die and join your ancestors."

(Numbers 31:3) 
Immediately Moses spoke to the people, saying: "Arm men from among you for battle. They must go and execute the Lord's vengeance against Midian."

(Numbers 31:4) 
"From each tribe of Israel, you will send a thousand men to war."

(Numbers 31:5) 
So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were sent—twelve thousand in total, prepared for battle.

(Numbers 31:6) 
Moses sent them with Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest. Phinehas carried the holy vessels and the trumpets for sounding the battle cry.

(Numbers 31:7) 
When they had fought against Midian and conquered them, they killed all the male inhabitants.

(Numbers 31:8) 
They also killed the kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—all five leaders of that nation. Additionally, they killed Balaam, the son of Beor, with the sword.

(Numbers 31:9) 
The children of Israel captured their women and their little ones. They also took all their cattle, all their flocks, and everything they could possess, carrying away all the plunder.

(Numbers 31:10) 
And they burned all the cities, villages, and fortified camps of Midian with fire.

(Numbers 31:11) 
Then, dividing the spoils and everything they had captured—both people and animals—they brought them to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to their camp in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan River across from Jericho.

(Numbers 31:12) 
Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the assembly went out to meet them.

(Numbers 31:13) 
Moses became angry with the leaders of the army, the tribunes (commanders of a thousand men), and the centurions (commanders of a hundred men), who were returning from the war.

(Numbers 31:14) 
He asked them: "Why have you kept all the women alive?"

(Numbers 31:15) 
"These are the very women who, at Balaam’s instigation, deceived the children of Israel. They led you to betray the Lord in the matter of Peor, which resulted in twenty-three thousand men of the people being killed."

(Numbers 31:16) 
"Therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every mother who has known a man by sleeping with him."

(Numbers 31:17) 
"But keep all the young girls and all the women who have not known a man through sexual intercourse alive for yourselves."

(Numbers 31:18) 
"Moreover, you must remain outside the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed a person or touched a dead body must purify himself on the third and seventh day."

(Numbers 31:19) 
"You must also purify yourselves, along with all your plunder: clothing, articles made of skins, woven goats' hair, and anything made of wood."

(Numbers 31:20) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 31:21) 
"This is the law of purification that the Lord has commanded."

(Numbers 31:22) 
"Anything that is gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead—"

(Numbers 31:23) 
"and everything that can endure fire—you must pass it through fire, and it will be made clean. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be purified with water."

(Numbers 31:24) 
"And on the seventh day, you must wash your clothes, and then you will be clean. After that, you may enter the camp."

(Numbers 31:25) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 31:26) 
"Separate the spoils—everything that has been captured, from people to livestock—and divide it into two parts. One part will go to those who went to war, and the other to the entire multitude of the people."

(Numbers 31:27) 
"From the half belonging to the soldiers, you must take one out of every five hundred—from both people and from cattle, donkeys, and sheep."

(Numbers 31:28) 
"This portion belongs to the Lord, taken from those who fought. You will give it to Eleazar the priest, because these are the Lord’s firstfruits (the first offerings)."

(Numbers 31:29) 
"From the half belonging to the children of Israel—that is, from what pertains to the multitude and the rest of the people—you will take one out of every fifty, from both people and from cattle, donkeys, sheep, and all living creatures. You will give this portion to the Levites, who stand guard over the Lord's tabernacle."

(Numbers 31:30) 
Moses and Eleazar did exactly as the Lord had commanded.

(Numbers 31:31) 
The total plunder, apart from what each individual soldier took for himself, amounted to six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,

(Numbers 31:32) 
seventy-two thousand cattle,

(Numbers 31:33) 
sixty-one thousand donkeys,

(Numbers 31:34) 
and thirty-two thousand human souls of the female sex, who had never lain with a man.

(Numbers 31:35) 
The portion for those who had gone to war was thirty-three thousand seven hundred fifty sheep.

(Numbers 31:36) 
From these, seventy-five sheep were designated as the Lord's portion.

(Numbers 31:37) 
Of the cattle, there were thirty-six thousand, and from these, seventy-two were designated as the Lord's portion.

(Numbers 31:38) 
Of the donkeys, there were thirty thousand five hundred, and from these, sixty-one were designated as the Lord's portion.

(Numbers 31:39) 
Of the human souls, there were fifteen thousand one hundred, and from these, thirty-two were designated as the Lord's portion.

(Numbers 31:40) 
And Moses gave to Eleazar the priest, to the Levites, and to the entire multitude of Israel, the divided portions just as the Lord had commanded.

(Numbers 32:1) 
Now the descendants of Reuben and Gad owned an immense amount of livestock. When they saw the regions of Jazer and Gilead, they recognized that these lands were very suitable for their herds.

(Numbers 32:2) 
So they came to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the assembly, and they spoke to them.

(Numbers 32:3) 
They spoke concerning Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nemra, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah, Nebo, and Beon.

(Numbers 32:4) 
This is the land that the Lord conquered before the eyes of the assembly of Israel—it is a very fertile land for the pasturing of our immense herds.

(Numbers 32:5) 
Therefore, we beg you: if we have found favor in your sight, please give this land to us, your servants, as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan River.

(Numbers 32:6) 
Moses then said to the descendants of Gad and Reuben: 'Are your brothers going to war, while you yourselves remain here?'

(Numbers 32:7) 
Why are you discouraging the minds of the other descendants of Israel, preventing them from daring to cross into the land that the Lord is about to give them?

(Numbers 32:8) 
Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to explore the promised land.

(Numbers 32:9) 
When they went up as far as the Valley of Eshcol and surveyed the entire land, they turned away the hearts of the descendants of Israel, so that they would not enter the borders that the Lord had given them.

(Numbers 32:10) 
Therefore, the Lord became angry and swore an oath, saying:

(Numbers 32:11) 
Surely none of these men of this evil generation will see the land that I solemnly promised by oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—because they refused to follow Me completely.

(Numbers 32:12) 
Except for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua, the son of Nun; only these two completely fulfilled the command of the Lord.

(Numbers 32:13) 
And so, the Lord's anger burned against Israel. He made them wander for thirty-eight years through the desert, until that entire generation who had done evil in His sight had completely perished.

(Numbers 32:14) 
And look, you have now followed in your fathers' footsteps, a new generation of sinful men, only to further increase the Lord's burning fury against Israel.

(Numbers 32:15) 
For if you refuse to follow Him, He will abandon us all again in this desert, and you will bring ruin upon this entire people.

(Numbers 32:16) 
But they came closer and said to Moses: 'We will only build sheepfolds for our immense herds and construct walled cities for our little ones and our families.'

(Numbers 32:17) 
But we ourselves will arm ourselves and go forward, prepared for battle, before the other descendants of Israel. We will lead them into their allotted places. We will leave our children and our families in fortified cities because of the ambushes of the inhabitants of this land.

(Numbers 32:18) 
We will not return to our homes until all the other descendants of Israel have taken possession of their full inheritance.

(Numbers 32:19) 
Furthermore, we will not ask for any additional land beyond the Jordan, because we already have our full possession here, on the eastern side of the river.

(Numbers 32:20) 
Moses responded to them: 'If you truly do what you promise, and if you go forth, ready for battle, before the Lord, to fight—'

(Numbers 32:21) 
'—And every armed man among you crosses the Jordan, until the Lord has completely overthrown His enemies—'

(Numbers 32:22) 
'—and the land is subdued before you; then you may return. You will be held blameless before the Lord and before Israel. And you will truly possess these regions that you have chosen, by the Lord’s authority.'

(Numbers 32:23) 
But if you do not do what you say, then without a doubt, you will be sinning against the Lord. And be assured: your sin will certainly find you out and catch you.

(Numbers 32:24) 
Therefore, build your cities for your children and your families, and construct sheepfolds and stables for your immense herds. But most importantly, fulfill what you have promised.

(Numbers 32:25) 
The descendants of Gad and Reuben responded to Moses: 'We, your servants, will do exactly as our lord commands.'

(Numbers 32:26) 
Our children, our wives, our immense herds, and all our other livestock will remain in the cities of Gilead.

(Numbers 32:27) 
But your servants, every one of us prepared for battle, will cross over before the Lord into the conflict, just as our lord has spoken.

(Numbers 32:28) 
Moses therefore gave these instructions concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chiefs of the family units within each tribe of Israel.

(Numbers 32:29) 
He said: 'If the descendants of Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan with you, all of them prepared for battle, and if the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as their possession.'

(Numbers 32:30) 
But if they are unwilling to cross the Jordan with you, armed for battle, into the land of Canaan, then they will forfeit their request for Gilead. Instead, they must then receive their portion among you, within the land of Canaan itself, just like the other tribes.

(Numbers 32:31) 
The descendants of Gad and Reuben responded, saying: 'Just as the Lord has spoken to His servants through you, so we will do.'

(Numbers 32:32) 
We will cross over, armed, to the land of Canaan. And only after we have helped to secure the possession for the other tribes beyond the Jordan, will we then return to our own possession on this side of the Jordan.

(Numbers 32:33) 
So Moses gave to the descendants of Gad and Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan. This included all the land with its surrounding cities.

(Numbers 32:34) 
And the descendants of Gad built or rebuilt the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer.

(Numbers 32:35) 
They also built Atroth-shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah.

(Numbers 32:36) 
They also built Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as walled cities, and constructed sheepfolds for their immense herds.

(Numbers 32:37) 
But the descendants of Reuben built or rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim.

(Numbers 32:38) 
They also rebuilt Nebo and Baal-meon, giving them new names, and they rebuilt Sibmah. They were assigning new names to all the cities they rebuilt or constructed.

(Numbers 32:39) 
Furthermore, the descendants of Machir, the son of Manasseh, went into Gilead and devastated it, killing all the Amorite inhabitants who lived there.

(Numbers 32:40) 
Therefore, Moses gave the region of Gilead to Machir, the son of Manasseh, and his descendants settled there.

(Numbers 33:1) 
These are the stages of the journey for the sons of Israel.
They departed from Egypt, organized by their family groups and tribes,
under the leadership and guidance of Moses and Aaron.

(Numbers 33:2) 
Moses recorded these stages of their journey, each one changing at the Lord’s command,
listing every encampment.

(Numbers 33:3) 
They departed from Rameses in the first month.
It was the fifteenth day of that first month, on the day after the Passover observance,
while all the Egyptians watched.

(Numbers 33:4) 
The Egyptians were busy burying their firstborn children,
whom the Lord had struck down throughout Egypt.
Through these judgments, the Lord had exacted vengeance upon their gods.

(Numbers 33:5) 
Then the sons of Israel departed from Rameses
and set up camp in Succoth.

(Numbers 33:6) 
From Succoth, they journeyed to Etham,
which is located at the very edge of the wilderness.

(Numbers 33:7) 
Departing from there, they came and encamped before Pi-Hahiroth,
which faces Baal-Zephon,
and they set up their camp opposite Migdol.

(Numbers 33:8) 
Journeying from Pi-Hahiroth,
they passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness.
They traveled for three days through the wilderness of Etham
and then encamped in Marah.

(Numbers 33:9) 
From Marah, they came to Elim.
In Elim, there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees.
They then set up camp beside these waters.

(Numbers 33:10) 
Departing from Elim,
they established their camp beside the Red Sea.

(Numbers 33:11) 
From the Red Sea, they proceeded into the Wilderness of Sin.

(Numbers 33:12) 
From the Wilderness of Sin,
they journeyed to Dophkah.

(Numbers 33:13) 
From Dophkah,
they arrived at Alush.

(Numbers 33:14) 
Departing from Alush, they traveled
and set up camp in Rephidim.
In this place, the people had no water to drink.

(Numbers 33:15) 
From Rephidim, they journeyed into the Wilderness of Sinai.

(Numbers 33:16) 
From the Wilderness of Sinai,
they came to Kibroth-Hattaavah, which means 'the graves of craving'.

(Numbers 33:17) 
From Kibroth-Hattaavah,
they journeyed to Hazeroth.

(Numbers 33:18) 
From Hazeroth,
they arrived at Rithmah.

(Numbers 33:19) 
From Rithmah,
they journeyed to Rimmon-Perez.

(Numbers 33:20) 
From Rimmon-Perez,
they arrived at Libnah.

(Numbers 33:21) 
From Libnah,
they journeyed to Rissah.

(Numbers 33:22) 
From Rissah,
they arrived at Kehelathah.

(Numbers 33:23) 
From Kehelathah,
they journeyed to Mount Shepher.

(Numbers 33:24) 
From Mount Shepher,
they arrived at Haradah.

(Numbers 33:25) 
From Haradah,
they journeyed to Makheloth.

(Numbers 33:26) 
From Makheloth,
they arrived at Tahath.

(Numbers 33:27) 
From Tahath,
they journeyed to Terah.

(Numbers 33:28) 
From Terah,
they arrived at Mithkah.

(Numbers 33:29) 
From Mithkah,
they journeyed to Hashmonah.

(Numbers 33:30) 
From Hashmonah,
they arrived at Moseroth.

(Numbers 33:31) 
From Moseroth,
they journeyed to Bene-Jaakan.

(Numbers 33:32) 
From Bene-Jaakan,
they arrived at Hor-Hagidgad.

(Numbers 33:33) 
From Hor-Hagidgad,
they journeyed to Jotbathah.

(Numbers 33:34) 
From Jotbathah,
they arrived at Ebronah.

(Numbers 33:35) 
From Ebronah,
they journeyed to Ezion-Geber.

(Numbers 33:36) 
From Ezion-Geber,
they journeyed to the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

(Numbers 33:37) 
From Kadesh,
they journeyed to Mount Hor, which is on the border of the land of Edom.

(Numbers 33:38) 
When Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor, as the Lord commanded,
it was in the thirty-ninth year after the sons of Israel’s departure from the land of Egypt,
in the fifth month, on the first day of that month.

(Numbers 33:39) 
Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old,
and there, on that mountain, he died.

(Numbers 33:40) 
The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb—the southern part of the land of Canaan—
had heard that the sons of Israel were approaching.

(Numbers 34:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 34:2) 
Give a command to the children of Israel and say to them: 'When you enter the land of Chanaan, and it falls to you by lot as your possession, it will be marked by these specific boundaries:

(Numbers 34:3) 
The southern part of the border will be marked out from the wilderness of Sin, which is opposite Edom. This border will extend along the width of the eastern Salt Sea, which is also known as the Dead Sea.

(Numbers 34:4) 
The border will then curve around to the south, opposite the Ascent of Scorpions. It will pass into Senna, and reach Cadesbarne. From there, it will extend to the town named Adar and continue as far as Asemona.

(Numbers 34:5) 
Finally, circling from Asemona, the border will follow the Brook of Egypt and will extend to the edge of the western sea.

(Numbers 34:6) 
The western boundary will also extend from this sea all the way to the Great Sea—the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your coastline.

(Numbers 34:7) 
Furthermore, the northern side will be defined from the Great Sea, all the way to Mount Altissimus.

(Numbers 34:8) 
From Mount Altissimus, it will reach as far as Emath. From the borders of Emath, it will extend to Sedada.

(Numbers 34:9) 
The borders will continue as far as Sephron and will reach the town of Enan. This will be your boundary on the northern side.

(Numbers 34:10) 
From there, the borders will be directed towards the eastern side, from the town of Enan as far as Sephama.

(Numbers 34:11) 
And from Sephama, they will descend to Rabla, opposite the spring. They will then reach as far as the eastern Sea of Cenereth, also known as the Sea of Galilee.

(Numbers 34:12) 
The border will extend to the Jordan River and to the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea. This will be your land all around its borders.

(Numbers 34:13) 
Moses then commanded the children of Israel, saying: 'This is the land that you will possess by lot, and which the Lord has commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Numbers 34:14) 
For the tribe of Ruben, according to its families, and the tribe of Gad, according to its clans, and also the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their portion of the land.

(Numbers 34:15) 
This portion of land is beyond the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side.

(Numbers 34:16) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 34:17) 
These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue, the son of Nun.

(Numbers 34:18) 
A prince will also be appointed for each of the tribes.

(Numbers 34:19) 
These are their names: For the tribe of Juda, Caleb, the son of Jephone.

(Numbers 34:20) 
For the tribe of Simeon, Samuel, the son of Ammiud.

(Numbers 34:21) 
For the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad, the son of Chaselon.

(Numbers 34:22) 
For the tribe of Dan, Bocci, the son of Jogli.

(Numbers 34:23) 
For the sons of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Haniel, the son of Ephod.

(Numbers 34:24) 
For the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel, the son of Sephtan.

(Numbers 34:25) 
For the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan, the son of Pharnach.

(Numbers 34:26) 
For the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel, the prince, the son of Ozan.

(Numbers 34:27) 
For the tribe of Aser, Ahiud, the son of Salomi.

(Numbers 34:28) 
For the tribe of Nephthali, Phedael, the son of Ammiud.

(Numbers 34:29) 
These are the men whom the Lord commanded to distribute the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel.

(Numbers 35:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, saying:

(Numbers 35:2) 
“Command the children of Israel that out of their inherited lands, they are to give the Levites cities to live in, along with their surrounding pasture lands.

(Numbers 35:3) 
So that the Levites may dwell in these towns, and the pasture lands may be for their cattle and all their other livestock.

(Numbers 35:4) 
These pasture lands, extending from the city walls outwards, are to reach one thousand paces in every direction.

(Numbers 35:5) 
Therefore, they shall have one thousand paces to the east, one thousand to the south, one thousand to the west, and one thousand to the north, with the city located in the center.

(Numbers 35:6) 
Among these cities that you will give to the Levites, six are to be designated as cities of refuge, where anyone who has killed another person may flee for safety. In addition to these six, you are to give them forty-two other cities.

(Numbers 35:7) 
Thus, all the cities together, including their pasture lands, will total forty-eight.

(Numbers 35:8) 
From the inherited lands of the children of Israel, you shall give these cities, taking more from the larger tribes and less from the smaller tribes, according to their possessions.

(Numbers 35:9) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Numbers 35:10) 
“Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: ‘When you have crossed the Jordan River into the land of Canaan,

(Numbers 35:11) 
you shall designate certain cities to be cities of refuge, so that anyone who has unintentionally shed blood —that is, killed someone without intent— may flee to them for safety.

(Numbers 35:12) 
These cities will be places of safety for you, so that the avenger of blood —the victim’s relative— does not pursue and kill the one who has caused the death before he has had the chance to stand trial before the assembly.

(Numbers 35:13) 
Of these cities that you are to designate as cities of refuge, three are to be located east of the Jordan River, and three are to be located in the land of Canaan.

(Numbers 35:14) 
These six cities of refuge will stand ready; anyone who has shed blood —even if unintentionally— may flee to them.

(Numbers 35:15) 
Both the children of Israel, as well as any foreigners or temporary residents living among you, shall have access to these same places of refuge, so that anyone who has unintentionally shed blood may flee to them.

(Numbers 35:16) 
If anyone strikes another person with an iron instrument, and the person who was struck dies, then the attacker is guilty of murder; the murderer himself must be put to death.

(Numbers 35:17) 
If someone throws a stone, and it strikes a person and that person dies, then the thrower is guilty of murder; he must be put to death.

(Numbers 35:18) 
If he strikes with a wooden object and that person dies, he is guilty of murder; he must be put to death.

(Numbers 35:19) 
The avenger of blood —the victim’s relative— is to kill the murderer; as soon as he catches him, he is to execute him.

(Numbers 35:20) 
If someone pushes another person out of hatred, or throws something at them with hostile intent—

(Numbers 35:21) 
—or strikes him with a hostile hand, and that person dies, then the attacker is a murderer. The avenger of blood, as soon as he finds him, is to execute him.

(Numbers 35:22) 
But if someone does any of these things by accident, not out of hatred, and without any hostile intent—

(Numbers 35:23) 
—for example, if a person accidentally drops a stone that could kill someone, without intending to hit anyone, or without even seeing anyone there, and it falls upon someone who then dies:

(Numbers 35:24) 
—if this happens by accident, and the person who caused the death was not an enemy of the deceased, nor did he intend any harm to him:

(Numbers 35:25) 
Then the assembly shall judge the case. The person who caused the death, having been found innocent of intentional murder, will be protected from the avenger of blood. He must return to the city of refuge to which he had fled and must remain there until the death of the High Priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.

(Numbers 35:26) 
However, if the one who has fled to a city of refuge goes outside the boundaries of that city and its pasture lands,

(Numbers 35:27) 
and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of the city of refuge, and kills him, the avenger will not be guilty of murder.

(Numbers 35:28) 
For the one who caused the death must remain in the city of refuge until the death of the High Priest; only after the High Priest’s death may he return to his own inherited land and property.

(Numbers 35:29) 
These regulations shall be a sacred and binding ordinance for you throughout all your generations and in all the places where you dwell.

(Numbers 35:30) 
If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death only upon the testimony of two or three witnesses. No one is to be put to death on the testimony of a single witness alone.

(Numbers 35:31) 
You shall not accept any ransom or payment from a person who is guilty of murder in exchange for his life; the murderer himself must be put to death immediately.

(Numbers 35:32) 
Nor shall you accept any ransom to allow a person who has fled to a city of refuge to return to his home before the death of the High Priest.

(Numbers 35:33) 
Do not pollute the land where you live with bloodshed. The land is polluted by blood, and it cannot be cleansed or atoned for except by the blood of the person who shed it.

(Numbers 35:34) 
You must cleanse the land where you live from this pollution, for I, the Lord, will dwell among you. Indeed, I am the Lord, who makes His dwelling among the children of Israel.

(Numbers 36:1) 
The chiefs of the Gilead families approached. These were the descendants of Machir, Manasseh’s son, from the lineage of Joseph’s sons. They spoke before Moses, and before the leaders of Israel, who were the heads of their families. They said:

(Numbers 36:2) 
Our Lord, the Commander of all, the Lord, had commanded you to distribute the land by lot among the sons of Israel. He also commanded that you give to the daughters of Zelophehad, our kinsman, their father’s inherited land.

(Numbers 36:3) 
Now, if these daughters marry anyone from a different tribe, then their inherited land will transfer to the tribe to which their new family belongs. This would reduce the amount of land allotted to our own tribe.

(Numbers 36:4) 
Furthermore, when the Jubilee comes—that is, the fifty-fifth year of remission of debts and return of land—their inherited land will become permanently joined to the inheritance of that other tribe. It will permanently pass out of our possession and ownership.

(Numbers 36:5) 
Moses responded to the sons of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph has spoken correctly in this matter.”

(Numbers 36:6) 
This is the Lord’s decree, which He has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad. He said: “Let them marry whomever they wish, but only to a man from their own tribe and their own family lineage, not to a man from another tribe.”

(Numbers 36:7) 
This is so that the inherited lands of the sons of Israel do not get mixed up or transferred from one tribe to another. Instead, each man should take a wife from his own clan and lineage.

(Numbers 36:8) 
Any woman who receives inherited land as her possession must marry a man from within her own clan, so that the land does not transfer to another tribe, but remains with her ancestral tribe.

(Numbers 36:9) 
This ensures that no inherited land is transferred from one tribe to another, but that each tribe keeps its own inherited possessions.

(Numbers 36:10) 
Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, the daughters of Zelophehad did exactly that.

(Numbers 36:11) 
So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah—the daughters of Zelophehad—got married. They married their cousins on their father’s side.

(Numbers 36:12) 
They married within the family clan of Manasseh, which was from the lineage of Joseph’s son. And so, their inherited land remained within the tribe and family clan of their father.

(Numbers 36:13) 
These are the commands and legal decrees that the Lord commanded through Moses to the sons of Israel, in the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, opposite Jericho.
