(Malachi 1:1) 
This is the message from God, spoken to Israel through Malachi.

(Malachi 1:2) 
“I have loved you,” says God. But you say: “How have you loved us?” “Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?” says God. “I loved Jacob,

(Malachi 1:3) 
but I rejected Esau. I made his mountains into desolate wastelands, and turned his inheritance over to desert jackals.”

(Malachi 1:4) 
If the people of Edom say: “We are ruined, but we will rebuild the ruins,” then God says: “They may rebuild, but I will tear it down again. And they will be called ‘the territory of wickedness,’ and ‘the people whom God hates forever.’”

(Malachi 1:5) 
Your eyes will see this, and you will say, “God's glory extends beyond the borders of Israel!”

(Malachi 1:6) 
A son honors his father, and a servant honors his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due to me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due to me?” says God. “You priests despise my name, but you ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’”

(Malachi 1:7) 
You bring polluted food to my altar and ask, “How have we polluted you?” By saying, “God's table is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:8) 
When you offer a blind animal as a sacrifice, is that not evil? When you offer a lame or diseased animal, is that not evil? Offer it to your governor! Would he accept you or show you favor?” says God.

(Malachi 1:9) 
Now, plead with God for mercy! Because of your actions, will he accept your offerings?

(Malachi 1:10) 
Who among you will close the doors so that you do not light a useless fire on my altar? I have no pleasure in you,” says God, “and I will accept no offering from your hand.

(Malachi 1:11) 
From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is honored among the nations. In every place, incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering is made to me, because my name is great among the nations,” says God.

(Malachi 1:12) 
But you profane it by saying, “God’s table is polluted, and its food is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:13) 
You also say, “How tedious!” And you turn up your noses at it,” says God. “You bring what you have stolen, what is lame or diseased, and offer it as a sacrifice. Should I accept it from your hands?” says God.

(Malachi 1:14) 
Cursed is the deceiver who has a male in his flock, but vows to sacrifice a defective animal to God. For I am a great king,” says God, “and my name is feared among the nations.”

(Malachi 2:1) 
And now, priests, this is your mission.

(Malachi 2:2) 
If you do not listen to this command, and if you do not give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, I will send a famine among you. And I will curse your blessings, and I have already cursed them, because you have not taken this to heart.

(Malachi 2:3) 
Behold, I will rebuke you, and I will scatter your waste on your faces, the waste of your feast days. And you will be taken away with it.

(Malachi 2:4) 
And you will know that I have sent this mission to you, to fulfill my covenant with Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:5) 
My covenant with him was for life and peace, and I gave him reverence, and he reverenced me, and he feared my name.

(Malachi 2:6) 
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and equity, and he turned many away from iniquity.

(Malachi 2:7) 
For the lips of the priest guard knowledge, and they seek the law from his mouth, because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:8) 
But you have turned away from the way, and you have caused many to stumble in the law. You have destroyed the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:9) 
Therefore I also have made you contemptible and abject before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have accepted faces in the law.

(Malachi 2:10) 
Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why, then, do you despise your brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?

(Malachi 2:11) 
Judah has acted treacherously, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and has fallen into it.

(Malachi 2:12) 
May the Lord cut off the man who does this: who watches and answers from the tents of Jacob, and who offers an offering to the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:13) 
And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, and weeping, and wailing, so that I no longer look at the sacrifice, nor do I accept it with favor from your hand.

(Malachi 2:14) 
And you said: Why? Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised. For she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.

(Malachi 2:15) 
Did He not make one flesh, and has the remnant of His Spirit? And why does He seek one flesh? And seeking the seed of God. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not despise the wife of your youth.

(Malachi 2:16) 
If you hate her, put her away, says the Lord God of Israel: for iniquity shall cover your iniquity, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not act treacherously.

(Malachi 2:17) 
You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you said: How have we wearied Him? In that you say: Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such things are pleasing to Him. Or, where is the God of justice?

(Malachi 3:1) 
I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And suddenly the Master you seek will come, and the angel of the covenant you desire. Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:2) 
Who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' herb.

(Malachi 3:3) 
He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will make offerings to the Lord in righteousness.

(Malachi 3:4) 
Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years.

(Malachi 3:5) 
I will come to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who oppress the wage earner, the widow, and the orphan, and those who turn aside the stranger, and do not fear Me, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:6) 
For I am the Lord, and I do not change. Therefore, you, the sons of Jacob, are not consumed.

(Malachi 3:7) 
From the days of your fathers you have turned away from My ordinances and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you said, ‘How shall we return?’

(Malachi 3:8) 
Will a man rob God? Yet you rob Me. But you say, ‘In what do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.

(Malachi 3:9) 
You are cursed, because you rob Me, the whole nation of you.

(Malachi 3:10) 
Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this, says the Lord of hosts. See if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing for you until there is no room enough to receive it.

(Malachi 3:11) 
I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your ground, and the vine in your field shall not be barren, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:12) 
Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:13) 
Your words have been harsh against Me, says the Lord. But you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’

(Malachi 3:14) 
You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts?’

(Malachi 3:15) 
So now we call the arrogant blessed. For those who do wickedness are built up; they have tempted God and are saved.

(Malachi 3:16) 
Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another. The Lord paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name.

(Malachi 3:17) 
They will be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day that I am making, and they will be My special possession. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.

(Malachi 3:18) 
Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not serve Him.

(Malachi 4:1) 
Behold, the day is coming, it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and everyone who practices wickedness will be like straw. The coming day will consume them, says the Lord of hosts, leaving them neither root nor branch.

(Malachi 4:2) 
But for you who fear My name, the Son of justice will rise, and salvation will be under His wings. You will leave the darkness and leap about with joy, like calves from the stall.

(Malachi 4:3) 
Then you will trample upon the wicked, they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I act, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 4:4) 
Remember the law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, the precepts and judgments.

(Malachi 4:5) 
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.

(Malachi 4:6) 
He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a curse.

(1 Maccabees 1:1) 
After Alexander of Macedon, son of Philip, the first to reign over Greece, defeated many kings and then left the land of Kittim,

(1 Maccabees 1:2) 
he fought many wars against King Darius of Persia and Media,

(1 Maccabees 1:3) 
and he conquered fortresses and killed the kings of the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:4) 
He went to the ends of the earth, seizing plunder from many nations, and the earth was quiet before him.

(1 Maccabees 1:5) 
Alexander became arrogant, and his heart was lifted up.

(1 Maccabees 1:6) 
He gathered a very strong army and ruled over the region, the nations, and the kings.

(1 Maccabees 1:7) 
He died, and he realized that he was about to die.

(1 Maccabees 1:8) 
He called his servants, who were noble and had been raised with him since his youth, and he divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.

(1 Maccabees 1:9) 
Alexander reigned for twelve years, and then he died.

(1 Maccabees 1:10) 
His servants divided his kingdom, taking power, and they all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years: and evil increased in the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:11) 
Then came forth a sinful root, Antiochus, called Epiphanes, son of King Antiochus, who had been a hostage in Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

(1 Maccabees 1:12) 
In those days, some wicked men of Israel went out and persuaded many, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles around us. For since we separated ourselves from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 1:13) 
This speech pleased them.

(1 Maccabees 1:14) 
They sent word to King Antiochus, and he gave them authority to follow the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 1:15) 
They built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the nations,

(1 Maccabees 1:16) 
and they made themselves uncircumcised, and they abandoned the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the Gentiles, and were sold to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 1:17) 
The kingdom of Antiochus was prepared, and he gathered a very strong army, and entered into the land of Egypt, to reign over it.

(1 Maccabees 1:18) 
He came into Egypt with a multitude, with chariots, elephants, horsemen, and many ships,

(1 Maccabees 1:19) 
and he made war against Ptolemy, the king of Egypt: and Ptolemy was afraid before him, and fled.

(1 Maccabees 1:20) 
He seized the fortified cities in the land of Egypt and plundered the land of Egypt.

(1 Maccabees 1:21) 
Antiochus struck Egypt in the one hundred and forty-third year, and then he went up to Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:22) 
He went up to Jerusalem with a strong army.

(1 Maccabees 1:23) 
He entered the sanctuary with arrogance, and took the golden altar, and the lampstand of light, and all its vessels.

(1 Maccabees 1:24) 
He took the table of the bread of the Presence, the vessels for libations, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the golden ornament that was on the facade of the temple: and he plundered it all.

(1 Maccabees 1:25) 
He took silver, gold, and the precious vessels; and he found the hidden treasure.

(1 Maccabees 1:26) 
Taking it all, he went back to his own land, where he committed slaughter, and spoke great wickedness.

(1 Maccabees 1:27) 
There was great mourning in Israel and in all their places.

(1 Maccabees 1:28) 
The leaders and the elders groaned, the young men and maidens languished, and the beauty of the women was changed.

(1 Maccabees 1:29) 
Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and the bride was, as it were, in mourning.

(1 Maccabees 1:30) 
The earth shook over its inhabitants, and the whole house of Jacob was covered with confusion.

(1 Maccabees 1:31) 
After two years, the king sent the chief tax collector into the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude.

(1 Maccabees 1:32) 
He spoke to them with deceitful words of peace, and they believed him: and he suddenly attacked the city, and struck it with a great plague, and destroyed many people of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:33) 
He plundered the city, and burned it with fire, and demolished its houses, and its walls around it.

(1 Maccabees 1:34) 
He took captive the women and children, and possessed the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 1:35) 
They built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and strong towers, and it became a citadel for them:

(1 Maccabees 1:36) 
and they placed there a sinful people, wicked men, and they strengthened themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 1:37) 
They put treasure in it, and made a secret place, and they became a trap for the people of Israel always, and those who lay in wait for the sanctuary.

(1 Maccabees 1:38) 
They shed innocent blood around the sanctuary and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:39) 
The inhabitants feared them, and the dwelling became the dwelling of the Gentiles, and it became foreign to the people, and they were driven out, and withdrew from their sons.

(1 Maccabees 1:40) 
They took away the glory of the temple, and took away its vessels, and they burned its holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:41) 
They gave the cities of Judah to destruction.

(1 Maccabees 1:42) 
And they came to Jerusalem, and strangers lived there, and they drove out the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:43) 
They defiled the holy things, and put idols in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 1:44) 
And they sent word around to all parts of Judah, and brought out those who were not wicked, and gathered an army.

(1 Maccabees 1:45) 
And they came to the city, and took it, and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:46) 
And they did evil around the sanctuary, and the Gentiles did too.

(1 Maccabees 1:47) 
And all the nations agreed, and gave him power.

(1 Maccabees 1:48) 
And they did in Jerusalem according to the customs of the Gentiles, according to idols, and they did not cause danger.

(1 Maccabees 1:49) 
And they placed idols in the temple, and burned the temple with fire.

(1 Maccabees 1:50) 
They shed the blood of the just, and turned their prayers into blood.

(1 Maccabees 1:51) 
And all the people who were around, helped them.

(1 Maccabees 1:52) 
And the king commanded his whole land, that all should be one people, and that everyone should abandon their own law.

(1 Maccabees 1:53) 
And all the Gentiles agreed according to the king's word.

(1 Maccabees 1:54) 
And many of Israel submitted to his servitude, and sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 1:55) 
And the king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah, that they should follow the laws of the Gentiles of the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:56) 
and that they should forbid the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and libations in the sanctification of the temple,

(1 Maccabees 1:57) 
and that they should profane the sabbaths and solemnities,

(1 Maccabees 1:58) 
and contaminate the holy things and the holy days.

(1 Maccabees 1:59) 
And that they should build altars, shrines, and idols, and sacrifice pigs and unclean animals,

(1 Maccabees 1:60) 
and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, and defile their souls in all things unclean and abominable,

(1 Maccabees 1:61) 
that they should put their souls in all worship of idols, and forget the holy name.

(1 Maccabees 1:62) 
And whoever does not act according to the king's word, shall die.

(1 Maccabees 1:63) 
He wrote all these things in his whole land, and appointed officials over all the people, and commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 1:64) 
Then many of the people, who had forsaken the law of the Lord, went over to them, and did evil in the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:65) 
and led Israel into hiding.

(1 Maccabees 2:1) 
Some time later, Mattathias, son of John, son of Simon, a priest from the family of Joarib, left Jerusalem upon hearing that many from Judah and Jerusalem were turning away from God.

(1 Maccabees 2:2) 
The Jews were committing wicked acts in the land of Israel, and had shown great disrespect in Jerusalem, following the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:3) 
Mattathias and his sons said: “Woe to us! Why have we been born? What has happened to us?

(1 Maccabees 2:4) 
The sacred vessels were taken and scattered, our sons are lost, and the sons of Zion have been murdered by our enemies.

(1 Maccabees 2:5) 
Glory has been taken from us, and the kingdom and the sanctity of God are overthrown; we are now like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:6) 
Why then do we delay?

(1 Maccabees 2:7) 
So all of the people gathered around them.

(1 Maccabees 2:8) 
They gathered in a place called Mizpah, near Jerusalem, because it was a place of prayer in Israel.

(1 Maccabees 2:9) 
Jonathan, son of Mattathias, and his sons said to their brothers: “Now our enemies are united, and the Gentiles have turned against us.

(1 Maccabees 2:10) 
Come, let us strengthen our people, and fight for our people and for our holy things.”

(1 Maccabees 2:11) 
So the whole army was gathered, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 2:12) 
Then Mattathias said: “Listen, you who are zealous for the law, so that you may do justice and righteousness in your days.

(1 Maccabees 2:13) 
Follow me.

(1 Maccabees 2:14) 
Our brothers are dead, scattered throughout the land, because of the wicked deeds of the evildoers: and we are like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:15) 
So gather yourselves, and let us fight for our lives.”

(1 Maccabees 2:16) 
Then the whole army gathered on that day, and they held a meeting on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:17) 
They said to them: “Why is it that you all left, and are sitting still?

(1 Maccabees 2:18) 
The men of the Gentiles said: “Let us go and do as the king has commanded, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 2:19) 
They replied to them: “We will not do it, nor will we obey the king’s command, nor will we depart from our religion, nor from any part of our works.”

(1 Maccabees 2:20) 
Then they stopped fighting.

(1 Maccabees 2:21) 
Many Israelites agreed with the wicked deeds, and they sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:22) 
Then Mattathias and his sons said: “If we all do as our brothers did, and do not fight for our lives, for our righteousness, and for our holy things,

(1 Maccabees 2:23) 
everyone will kill us on the Sabbaths.”

(1 Maccabees 2:24) 
So they gathered against them: and fought with them: and killed them on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:25) 
While they were pursuing them on the Sabbaths, they came upon them with great force.

(1 Maccabees 2:26) 
They killed them on that day, and with the wicked, and did not count them.

(1 Maccabees 2:27) 
Mattathias and his friends dressed, and they ran throughout the entire city, and destroyed the altars of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 2:28) 
They circumcised the boys who were found uncircumcised in the borders of Israel, according to the law.

(1 Maccabees 2:29) 
And they pursued the sons of the proud, and the work prospered in their hands.

(1 Maccabees 2:30) 
They gained the law from the hand of the Gentiles, and from the hand of the kings, and they did not give a place to sinners.

(1 Maccabees 2:31) 
The day of Mattathias’s death approached: and he said to his sons: “Now pride, punishment, the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation are established.

(1 Maccabees 2:32) 
Now therefore, sons, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.

(1 Maccabees 2:33) 
And he responded, saying: “Behold, Simon your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel: always listen to him, and he will be a father to you.”

(1 Maccabees 2:34) 
And Judas Maccabaeus, strong from his youth, will be the leader of the army for you, and he will wage war against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:35) 
And bring to yourselves all those who keep the law, and take vengeance on your people.

(1 Maccabees 2:36) 
Repay the Gentiles their retribution, and pay attention to the commandments of the law.”

(1 Maccabees 2:37) 
Then Mattathias died: and his sons buried him in the tombs of their fathers in Modein, and all Israel mourned for him with great mourning.

(1 Maccabees 3:1) 
In those days, Antiochus, the son of King Antiochus, departed from Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year.

(1 Maccabees 3:2) 
In those days, the sons of iniquity went out from Israel and persuaded many people, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles who are around us. Because since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 3:3) 
And this word seemed good in their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 3:4) 
And they appointed some of the people and sent them to the king, and the king gave them authority to do according to the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:5) 
And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, following the laws of the nations:

(1 Maccabees 3:6) 
they circumcised themselves, abandoned the holy covenant, allied themselves with the Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 3:7) 
And as the kingdom grew stronger, Antiochus sent to Jerusalem, to the city, to crush it.

(1 Maccabees 3:8) 
And he entered it with a great multitude, took the city, and inflicted a great slaughter in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:9) 
And he commanded his angels to do it, and they went out and struck the men in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:10) 
And they shed the blood of the just and defiled the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:11) 
And they seized the spoils of the city, burned it with fire, and destroyed its houses and walls all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:12) 
And they took women and children captive and took possession of the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 3:13) 
And they built a wall around the city of David, great and strong, and strong towers, and it became a fortress for them.

(1 Maccabees 3:14) 
And they placed a sinful people and wicked men there, and they fortified themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:15) 
And they imposed an unjust temple, and every nation that was there, with evil works.

(1 Maccabees 3:16) 
And they took away the continual sacrifice and the sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 3:17) 
And they set up the abomination of desolation in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:18) 
And they built altars in the cities of Judah all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:19) 
And they sacrificed at the gates of houses and in the streets.

(1 Maccabees 3:20) 
And they burned the books of the law with fire, which they had found.

(1 Maccabees 3:21) 
And they killed anyone they found possessing the testament and observing the law, by the king's command.

(1 Maccabees 3:22) 
And they acted with their might in Jerusalem, and in the months, and in the days.

(1 Maccabees 3:23) 
And they sent to Beria with great violence, to fill Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:24) 
And on the twenty-fifth day of the month, they sacrificed on the altar of idols, which was above the altar of the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:25) 
And they killed the women who had circumcised their sons, according to the command, and they hanged their sons by the neck.

(1 Maccabees 3:26) 
And many of Israel resolved within themselves and determined not to eat anything unclean.

(1 Maccabees 3:27) 
And they chose death rather than be defiled and not pollute the holy covenant; and they died.

(1 Maccabees 3:28) 
And great wrath came upon Israel.

(1 Maccabees 3:29) 
In those days, Mattathias, the son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, arose and settled in the city of Modin.

(1 Maccabees 3:30) 
And he had five sons: John, and Simon, who was called Thassi, and Judas, who was called Maccabaeus.

(1 Maccabees 3:31) 
And Eleazar, and Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 3:32) 
And he saw the zeal and iniquities that were happening in Judah and Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:33) 
And he said: “Woe is me! Why was I born to see this? I am grieved by the destruction of my people, and I am grieved by the destruction of the holy place, and I have been delivered into the hands of foreigners.”

(1 Maccabees 3:34) 
And he gathered all of his belongings, and they went out into the desert, where they left their sons and their wives.

(1 Maccabees 3:35) 
And they went out with their sons and fought in the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:36) 
And Antiochus the king sent troops to force those who were left to come down and transgress.

(1 Maccabees 3:37) 
And they said to Mattathias: “You are the son of a prince, and you are great and noble in this city, and here is a gathering, and the Gentiles who are around are at your service.

(1 Maccabees 3:38) 
Come, therefore, first, and do the king’s command, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah have done, and those who remained in Jerusalem. And you and your sons will be in the number of the king's friends, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”

(1 Maccabees 3:39) 
And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice: “Even if all the Gentiles who are in the king’s kingdom have listened to him and have departed from the worship of their fathers and have chosen his desires.

(1 Maccabees 3:40) 
I and my sons and my brothers will walk in the covenant of our fathers.

(1 Maccabees 3:41) 
May it be far from us that we should forsake the law and its judgments.

(1 Maccabees 3:42) 
We will not obey the words of the king, nor will we transgress our worship, neither to the right nor to the left.”

(1 Maccabees 3:43) 
And when he had finished speaking these words, a certain Jew approached in the sight of all, to sacrifice to idols in the city of Modin, according to the king’s command.

(1 Maccabees 3:44) 
And Mattathias saw this, and he was inflamed with zeal, and his loins trembled, and he was moved to indignation according to judgment, and he rushed forward and struck him on the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:45) 
And also the man who was carrying out the king's command, he struck in the same hour, and they destroyed the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:46) 
And they were zealous for the law, as Phinehas did with Zambri the son of Salomi.

(1 Maccabees 3:47) 
And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: “Whoever has zeal for the law and keeps the statutes, let him come out after me.”

(1 Maccabees 3:48) 
And he and his sons fled into the mountains and left all that they had in the city.

(1 Maccabees 3:49) 
Then many went down, seeking judgment and justice, to go into the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:50) 
And they lived there, they and their sons and their wives and their livestock because evils had abounded upon them.

(1 Maccabees 3:51) 
And this word was announced to King Antiochus, and he was angry, and he gathered all his army and said: “I know that the Jews have departed from me and do not do what I want, but they have been led by me into their laws.”

(1 Maccabees 3:52) 
And he sent an army to them, with a multitude, to destroy them.

(1 Maccabees 3:53) 
And the army went out against them and approached them and encamped against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:54) 
And they said to them: “Now we will do to you: Go out and do according to the word of the king, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 3:55) 
They said: “We will not go out, nor will we do the word of the king, nor will we transgress the Sabbath day.”

(1 Maccabees 3:56) 
And they gave them battle quickly.

(1 Maccabees 3:57) 
And they did not respond to them, nor did they throw a stone, nor did they obstruct their places, saying, “Let us all die in our innocence.”

(1 Maccabees 3:58) 
And they gathered against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:59) 
And they died, with their wives and their sons and their livestock, and they descended to a thousand souls.

(1 Maccabees 3:60) 
And Mattathias and his friends knew this and mourned them greatly.

(1 Maccabees 3:61) 
And they said, man to his neighbor: “If we all do as our brothers did and do not fight for our souls and our justifications, we will all be surrendered in a short time.

(1 Maccabees 3:62) 
And they resolved on that day, saying: “Whoever comes against us in battle on the Sabbath, we will fight against him, and we will not all die as our brothers died in secret places.”

(1 Maccabees 3:63) 
Then war was added to them from the side of the Asidaeans and the strong men of Israel, all who willingly offered themselves to the law.

(1 Maccabees 3:64) 
And all the Israelites who were fleeing from the evils added help to them and strengthened them.

(1 Maccabees 3:65) 
And the army gathered and struck the sinners in their anger and the wicked men in their indignation, and the rest fled to the Gentiles to preserve themselves.

(1 Maccabees 3:66) 
And Mattathias and his friends went around and destroyed the altars.

(1 Maccabees 3:67) 
And they circumcised the infant boys, whom they found in the borders of Israel, whoever they found.

(1 Maccabees 3:68) 
And they struck the sons of the arrogant.

(1 Maccabees 3:69) 
And they completed the work with their own hand, and they took vengeance in the hands of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:70) 
And the days which they completed and gave for the law are glorious.

(1 Maccabees 4:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-eighth year, the kings left Syria and entered the land of Judah.

(1 Maccabees 4:2) 
And Judas selected men, and sent soldiers, and fought against them: and killed about three thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:3) 
And the army of the Jews gathered, and they came to Gophna: and went away.

(1 Maccabees 4:4) 
Then the enemies of the Jews gathered, and came together as one: and went out as though to ascend to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:5) 
And Judas heard, he went out with ten men with him.

(1 Maccabees 4:6) 
And they fought bravely, and struck down about thirty men of the army: and they returned.

(1 Maccabees 4:7) 
And their enemies saw that the Jews were attacking them, and went out of the fields, and withdrew to the road, where they were.

(1 Maccabees 4:8) 
And the Jews gathered and came to Bethsura: and fought against them throughout the day.

(1 Maccabees 4:9) 
And they rose up in the day, and gave their hands to their men, and were in the same place.

(1 Maccabees 4:10) 
And they went out of Bethsura, and came to the camps of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:11) 
And it happened on that day, that Achima, son of Calami, entered from the camps of the Tyrians.

(1 Maccabees 4:12) 
And in that place they killed Achima, and his brothers: and they were slain.

(1 Maccabees 4:13) 
And Judas and his army gathered, and ascended to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:14) 
And he placed a garrison there, and commanded them to guard it.

(1 Maccabees 4:15) 
And Judas took and chose men, and sent them to Joppa, a city by the sea, to cast out those who were there of his people.

(1 Maccabees 4:16) 
And coming, he took the port, and killed those who were there: and left the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:17) 
And knowing that Judas was approaching, they feared: and they shut the gates, and were afraid.

(1 Maccabees 4:18) 
And Judas sent, and they seized them.

(1 Maccabees 4:19) 
And he crushed them with the sword, those who were in the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:20) 
And he took Joppa, and all the ports of Judea, and from the tribes, and came to Gaza.

(1 Maccabees 4:21) 
And those who were in Gaza came and shut themselves in.

(1 Maccabees 4:22) 
And Judas besieged it, and gave them plunder, and burned its walls.

(1 Maccabees 4:23) 
And they took a great amount of plunder from Gaza, and from its borders, and from all its villages that were in the surrounding area.

(1 Maccabees 4:24) 
And Judas took his army, and came to Ascalon: and there, in the fields, he adored their idols.

(1 Maccabees 4:25) 
And he turned away, and led his army away, and shouting, they returned to Judea with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:26) 
And they ascended Mount Zion with great joy and gladness: and they offered burnt offerings, because they had not perished from their enemies.

(1 Maccabees 4:27) 
And they celebrated the purification of the temple for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with joy, and sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 4:28) 
And they adorned the temple, and the courts, and sanctified the court.

(1 Maccabees 4:29) 
And they made lights on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is Chasalew.

(1 Maccabees 4:30) 
And they established by decree, to all the people of the Jews, that they should celebrate these days, every year.

(1 Maccabees 4:31) 
And in that time, Antiochus Epiphanes rose up and went to the land of the Persians.

(1 Maccabees 4:32) 
And he gathered an army, and fought against the Persians: and he was conquered.

(1 Maccabees 4:33) 
And entering Persia, he heard that there was great commotion in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:34) 
And departing from Persia, he came.

(1 Maccabees 4:35) 
And he sent Philip, his friend, over the Jews: and he killed in Jerusalem: and took away the reward from them.

(1 Maccabees 4:36) 
And in this matter, he approached with haste, and passed through Samaria, in order to destroy the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:37) 
And when he had done this, he heard that Judas and his brothers were near, and had gathered an army, and were fighting bravely.

(1 Maccabees 4:38) 
And he said: "Now I will divide my army, and I will fight against them, and I will kill them."

(1 Maccabees 4:39) 
And he gathered his army, and rushed, and began on the road, on the ascent to Bethoron.

(1 Maccabees 4:40) 
And Judas sent, and went out with a few, to meet the army.

(1 Maccabees 4:41) 
And seeing the army coming, he said: "Because they are many, and we are few:

(1 Maccabees 4:42) 
Let us not fear them: let us fight for our souls."

(1 Maccabees 4:43) 
And when they began to fight, he approached from the place, and the army was routed.

(1 Maccabees 4:44) 
And those who were in his sight, fled on the road from Bethoron: and the Jews pursued them to the plains, and killed about eight thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:45) 
And from there, Judas and his brothers set out, and came to the plains, and came to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:46) 
And Antiochus heard, he went out with great power, to fight against the Jews: and he commanded that preparations be made.

(1 Maccabees 4:47) 
And when his army was prepared and complete, he ordered them to go into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:48) 
And coming, he pitched camp against Bethsura: and fought for many days: and made machines and works.

(1 Maccabees 4:49) 
And those who were from Bethsura went out and burned: and struck the machines.

(1 Maccabees 4:50) 
And they fought great battles.

(1 Maccabees 4:51) 
And Judas knew that they had come, and that they were fighting, and their hearts began to be troubled.

(1 Maccabees 4:52) 
And those with him appeared, to be a help to him.

(1 Maccabees 4:53) 
And he went out as though to the camps against Antiochus, and they fought battles: and about five thousand men fell from his army.

(1 Maccabees 4:54) 
And Antiochus and his army, seeing that they had fallen, returned to Judea with great sorrow.

(1 Maccabees 4:55) 
And Judas and his brothers took their dead: and they buried them in the sepulchers of their fathers.

(1 Maccabees 4:56) 
And they put their bones in the sepulchers of their fathers: and they celebrated the twenty-fifth day of the month of September, with joy and gladness.

(1 Maccabees 4:57) 
And they established these days, every year, with joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:58) 
And they built camps on Mount Zion, around the temple: and they lived with the people, with joy and gladness, and fearing God.

(1 Maccabees 5:1) 
In those days, Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers rose up, and fought against the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 5:2) 
He went into their territory and defeated a large population and gained strength.

(1 Maccabees 5:3) 
He wounded Gedeon and those with him. Then he came to Galilee and overthrew them.

(1 Maccabees 5:4) 
He defeated them on the field, seized their spoils and their glory.

(1 Maccabees 5:5) 
He gathered the sons of foreigners and entered the land of Judah.

(1 Maccabees 5:6) 
All his brothers went out and fought against them, and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:7) 
They set fire to their land and seized their spoils and their swords.

He fought in Galilee and defeated them, and killed them and seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:9) 
He came to the borders of Samaria and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:10)

(1 Maccabees 5:11) 
They fought against them and prevailed, and killed many of them.

(1 Maccabees 5:12) 
John, Simon, and Judas, brothers of Judas, went to Galilee and into their territory.

(1 Maccabees 5:13) 
They gathered and fought against them and they fled before them, and they defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:14) 
They gathered all their forces with their wives and children, and their spoils, and entered the land of Judea, and came to Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 5:15) 
Judas and his brothers went to their territory and fought.

(1 Maccabees 5:16) 
They defeated their entire force so that many fell wounded and were killed, and they seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:17) 
They went through those in the borders of Galilee and the borders of Samaria, and into all their towns, and killed them.

(1 Maccabees 5:18) 
Many were wounded and killed.

(1 Maccabees 5:19) 
The Philistines gathered and came into the land of Judah and made an incursion.

(1 Maccabees 5:20) 
Judas and his brothers approached and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:21) 
They killed three thousand men among the Philistine people.

(1 Maccabees 5:22) 
Judas and his companions looked at those who had fallen and took their weapons.

(1 Maccabees 5:23) 
They pursued them as far as Gaza and the borders of Judah, and defeated them as far as Gaza and the borders of Azotus.

(1 Maccabees 5:24) 
They came to Askelon and into their land, for they had their idols, and they burned them with fire.

(1 Maccabees 5:25) 
On that day, those who were in the camp and those in the borders of Judea rose up unexpectedly to attack them.

(1 Maccabees 5:26) 
Judas went out and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:27) 
He defeated them, and killed about two thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:28) 
He returned to the camp with a great multitude of spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:29) 
In those days, those in the borders of Judea gathered and said to Simon, the brother of Judas,

(1 Maccabees 5:30) 
“Judas and his brothers have done great things, and war against the enemies and us.

(1 Maccabees 5:31) 
Send us, and we will fight for our brothers.

(1 Maccabees 5:32) 
Simon sent them to fight and they were chosen, and they went with him.

(1 Maccabees 5:33) 
They fought against them on that day and defeated them, and they fled before them.

(1 Maccabees 5:34) 
They pursued them in the field and killed about three thousand men and seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:35) 
They brought from Galilee and Arbatta, their wives and children, and all that they had, and came to the land of Judah with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 5:36) 
Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers went out and came to the borders of Idumea and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:37) 
They defeated the strong among them and seized the camps and attacked those who were in the tower.

(1 Maccabees 5:38) 
They besieged them, and set up machines against them, and they stormed and burned the tower with fire, and all who were in it.

(1 Maccabees 5:39) 
They went against them in another place and killed about twenty thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:40) 
When they came to a tower, which was very fortified, they besieged it and fought against it bravely.

(1 Maccabees 5:41) 
Two thousand men fell from those who were in it, and they burned the rest with fire, and they seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:42) 
From there, they set out to fight against the Ammonites, and they found a strong people and a large population.

(1 Maccabees 5:43) 
They fought against them greatly, and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 5:44) 
They fled and Judas and those who were with him defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:45) 
They gave up their towns and returned to Judah.

(1 Maccabees 5:46) 
The Gentiles who were in Gilead gathered against Israel, who were in their borders.

(1 Maccabees 5:47) 
They fought against them and fled to their borders and came to the camps.

(1 Maccabees 5:48) 
Then the sons of foreigners came together to destroy them, and they took the road to attack Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:49) 
They went out from the camps and met them in battle and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:50) 
Many of them were wounded and killed, and the rest fled to Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:51) 
They seized the camps in Gilead, and all that was in them, and came to the land of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 5:52) 
He gathered all the Israelites in Gilead, from small to great, and their wives, sons, daughters, and a very large family.

(1 Maccabees 5:53) 
They came to Sela, and came to the camps, and they worshipped the great God there.

(1 Maccabees 5:54) 
Judas and his brothers went out and fought against the sons of Esau in their land to the south, and they defeated Charracam and the sons of Esau, and prevailed over them, and seized their spoils and their swords.

(1 Maccabees 5:55) 
They went to Bethsura, which was a fortified city, and was a place where the people dwelt.

(1 Maccabees 5:56) 
Hearing that they were attacking the city and fighting against it, they gathered together as one.

(1 Maccabees 5:57) 
They went out from Bethsura, and many were wounded and killed among them.

(1 Maccabees 5:58) 
Judas and his brothers went into the field, and behold, a great multitude of those who were with John and who were with him in the borders of Judea, had perished.

(1 Maccabees 5:59) 
Judas and his brothers grieved and said to their relatives:

(1 Maccabees 5:60) 
“Their people have perished, and here we are. Let us fight.”

(1 Maccabees 5:61) 
He gathered the entire army and put them in prayer, to ask for peace from God.

(1 Maccabees 5:62) 
They went out with them and fought and defeated them, and many were wounded.

(1 Maccabees 5:63) 
They buried their dead.

(1 Maccabees 5:64) 
They returned to the camp, and there was a great victory.

(1 Maccabees 5:65) 
They remained in Bethsura, praising the Most High.

(1 Maccabees 5:66) 
In those days, the land of Judea had peace.

(1 Maccabees 6:1) 
In the year 150, in the eighth month, at Antioch, the other armies surrounded him.

(1 Maccabees 6:2) 
They loved Philip before he returned, and it was agreed that he would be the prince of the kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 6:3) 
Therefore, he hurried, so that he would have a task and would be ready for war. And suddenly he appeared from the ships, and entered the city, and seized it.

(1 Maccabees 6:4) 
But when Demetrius heard this, he gathered his army and set out against him.

(1 Maccabees 6:5) 
And they fought together, and Philip was driven from the city and became stronger.

(1 Maccabees 6:6) 
And Demetrius greatly lamented, and then he knew that his ruin was near.

(1 Maccabees 6:7) 
And he went to a place and commanded his friends: “Kill the boy Antiochus.”

(1 Maccabees 6:8) 
And he gave the command, and he died that day.

(1 Maccabees 6:9) 
And Demetrius sent Nicanor, the leader of the cavalry, with a great army, and he fought against Judas.

(1 Maccabees 6:10) 
And they announced to the people of Judah: “Behold, Nicanor is coming.”

(1 Maccabees 6:11) 
Having heard this, they trembled and were afraid; and the army prayed with the people, and cried out, and said:

(1 Maccabees 6:12) 
“Holy One, who has chosen this house, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, have mercy upon it; and let the filthy deeds and blasphemies of Nicanor not prevail against you.”

(1 Maccabees 6:13) 
And they fought; and about five thousand five hundred fell from Nicanor's army, and the rest fled into the city of David.

(1 Maccabees 6:14) 
After this, however, Nicanor went up to Mount Zion: and the priests and the elders of the people came out, greeting him peacefully.

(1 Maccabees 6:15) 
And they said: “There is no need to speak of this matter with the king.”

(1 Maccabees 6:16) 
And Nicanor did not accept their words, and in anger he swore to them, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:17) 
“Unless you hand over to me Judas and his army immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn down this house.”

(1 Maccabees 6:18) 
And Nicanor went away furiously. And the priests entered, standing before the altar and the temple, and saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:19) 
“You chose this house for your sanctification, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, that it may be for You a house of prayer and supplication for Your people.

(1 Maccabees 6:20) 
Avenge their iniquities, and take vengeance on them.”

(1 Maccabees 6:21) 
Now Nicanor departed from Jerusalem and placed his camp in Beth-Horon: and armies came out to meet him from Syria.

(1 Maccabees 6:22) 
And Judas sent against him. And they fought in the army of Nicanor; and about nine thousand of his army fell, and were wounded and weakened, and wounded in battle.

(1 Maccabees 6:23) 
And with this, they returned to their places. But Nicanor remained in the city of Jerusalem. And he was in the temple; and he killed everyone very unjustly.

(1 Maccabees 6:24) 
And Nicanor was angry, and said: “Unless they hand over to me Judas and his army, immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn the temple.”

(1 Maccabees 6:25) 
And Judas said: “If you hand him over to us, we will depart in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 6:26) 
And Nicanor departed, and the word was not fulfilled. And about this, Judas sent messengers to prepare for war.

(1 Maccabees 6:27) 
And they fought in Azotus; and about thirty-five thousand men fell from Nicanor's army: and Nicanor was defeated by the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 6:28) 
And the Jews fled from Azotus and pursued Nicanor as far as Gaza. And shouting after him, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:29) 
“For there will not be for us those who are to be seized by us”. And they took the head of Nicanor and his hand, which he had stretched out, and they hung it near the tower, and made it known to all.

(1 Maccabees 6:30) 
And they established one day, so that they would celebrate this day, that is, the day of victory. And they prayed and entreated the Lord.

(1 Maccabees 6:31) 
Then, calling Judas, and gathering together in the city of Jerusalem: and they decided that this should be celebrated annually on the thirteenth day of the month Adar.

(1 Maccabees 6:32) 
And the land of Judah rested for a little while.

(1 Maccabees 7:1) 
In the year 151, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, departed from Rome, and came with his men of war, and began to reign in the land of his kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 7:2) 
And when he had come into his kingdom and was seated on the throne of his reign, all the unrighteous and wicked men of Israel gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:3) 
They chose Alcimus, who had been High Priest, and decided to make him High Priest, and brought him to the king.

(1 Maccabees 7:4) 
And they accused the people, saying, "John and those who were with him have stirred up a rebellion and incited the people to revolt."

(1 Maccabees 7:5) 
Moved by these words, the king, together with some of his wicked friends, summoned them to kill John.

(1 Maccabees 7:6) 
Those who came killed John and his two sons, and then they killed the sons of those who had opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:7) 
And Alcimus did this, and all the wicked men with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:8) 
Then the entire people gathered, and they were angry; and they killed them, and they appointed righteous men to avenge them.

(1 Maccabees 7:9) 
Then Judea said, "Wickedness has been removed from Israel."

(1 Maccabees 7:10) 
Then all of his brothers and those who were with him settled in the area, and they fought Israel during those days.

(1 Maccabees 7:11) 
Then the wicked men of Israel went out and sought all the wicked, and they went away, and took the evil from among them.

(1 Maccabees 7:12) 
And on that day, there was war, and Judas struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 7:13) 
When Jason saw the wickedness in Israel, and his friends who came to mock them, he fled to the region of the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 7:14) 
He placed leaders against the borders of the people, and gathered them against them, and struck them down, and in the place of their evils, and they struck down the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 7:15) 
Then the sons of the strangers gathered together, and they came to attack Judea, and they went away from their own land.

(1 Maccabees 7:16) 
Then Simon and his brothers said, "In our days, in the days of our adversaries, we have gone forth from our land."

(1 Maccabees 7:17) 
And Judas gathered everyone together, and said, "Behold, I and my brothers, and the house of my father, we fight for the laws and the holy places."

(1 Maccabees 7:18) 
And all, because of this, rushed into battle.

(1 Maccabees 7:19) 
And he spoke, and all the nations feared him.

(1 Maccabees 7:20) 
Then Demetrius heard, and gathered his forces, and went to war in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:21) 
And he sent Nicanor, the commander of his army, to strike down the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 7:22) 
And when he approached Jerusalem, and saw the army of the Jews, he was afraid.

(1 Maccabees 7:23) 
And he feared the battle, and the fighting with the sons of Israel, and he wanted to return.

(1 Maccabees 7:24) 
And Nicanor blasphemed and swore, saying, "Unless the Jews are handed over into my hands, I will destroy the temple, and I will come and dwell there."

(1 Maccabees 7:25) 
And Judas heard the words of Nicanor, and he entered battle; and he was not afraid. And he fought against the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:26) 
And about five thousand men fell from the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:27) 
And Nicanor fled before the face of the army of the Jews, and he was struck down.

(1 Maccabees 7:28) 
And those who were in Judea, hearing that Nicanor had fallen, threw stones at them, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:29) 
And they released them, and attacked their nearest camps.

(1 Maccabees 7:30) 
And after doing this, they gathered and struck down Nicanor on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 7:31) 
And they placed their weapons, and their remains, and their heads, on a tree, and showed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:32) 
And all agreed, and swore, saying, "Blessed be the Lord, who has saved his people, and struck down the impious Nicanor, on that day."

(1 Maccabees 7:33) 
And they celebrated the fifteenth day of the month Adar, and on the same day, the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day.

(1 Maccabees 7:34) 
And thus it was said about the city of Jerusalem: "From the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day."

(1 Maccabees 7:35) 
And this is the end of Nicanor. And after Demetrius heard, he again sent Bacchides and Alcimus into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:36) 
He gave him a very strong army and went into the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:37) 
And Bacchides hurried and came, and struck them on the Sabbath, and spoke and killed many.

(1 Maccabees 7:38) 
And Judas said: "Why, why have we come forth?" And they gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:39) 
And Bacchides said: "Now, behold me and my people, I will strike and kill them."

(1 Maccabees 7:40) 
And they went out from Jerusalem, and came to Casalem, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:41) 
And from that day they struck them, and about fifteen men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 7:42) 
And Judas withdrew, and all those with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:43) 
And Bacchides gathered together and brought his men.

(1 Maccabees 7:44) 
And he came into the land of Judea, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:45) 
And all went out from Jerusalem, and they did the same with them, and they killed many of the people.

(1 Maccabees 7:46) 
And Bacchides returned, and set up camp in Azed, and built fortified cities in Judea: a fortress in Jericho, and in Emmaus, and in Bethoron, and in Bethel, and Thamnas, and Phara, and Thephon, and in the cities that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:47) 
And he placed guards in them, and fortified them, and stored provisions, and gathered soldiers in them.

(1 Maccabees 7:48) 
And with the sons of Israel, and those who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 7:49) 
And they gathered, and came to Jerusalem, and guarded the city until death.

(1 Maccabees 7:50) 
And they cried out in the city of Jerusalem, and their voice cried out to heaven.

(1 Maccabees 8:1) 
The news about the Romans was heard, that they were very strong, and were better than all the other nations, even those they fought with.

(1 Maccabees 8:2) 
And because they had brought all the peoples to themselves, they received them into friendship, and made peace with them, and because they were powerful.

(1 Maccabees 8:3) 
They heard about their wars, and the acts of valor they did in Galatia, how they had conquered them, and subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:4) 
And how much they had conquered in the provinces, and in other nations, and that they had received all of them into friendship.

(1 Maccabees 8:5) 
And about the wars, which they had waged with King Philip, and with Perseus, King of the Macedonians, and with the remaining nations that had fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 8:6) 
And because those whom they had conquered had come with them into battle, and had offered peace themselves.

(1 Maccabees 8:7) 
And the war, which they waged in Galatia, and how they subdued them, and brought them under tribute.

(1 Maccabees 8:8) 
And how much they had done in their land, and how they had subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:9) 
And about the things that were heard about them, that they were very strong men, and were kindly disposed towards their friends, and made an alliance with those who cultivated them.

(1 Maccabees 8:10) 
Therefore, Judas and his brothers pleased the Romans, and sent to them, to make friendship, and an alliance, and to be a help to them.

(1 Maccabees 8:11) 
And the matter was accepted by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:12) 
Therefore, the Roman senators sent letters of this kind to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:13) 
To the Romans and to the people of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:14) 
If we are engaged in war against you, we will first take you as an aid.

(1 Maccabees 8:15) 
But if you undertake a war against us, we will assist you in the war.

(1 Maccabees 8:16) 
The Romans are witnesses to these letters, first of all.

(1 Maccabees 8:17) 
And they sent letters of this kind to Jerusalem, to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:18) 
To Judas and his brothers, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:19) 
They sent us ambassadors to make friendship, and an alliance: so we received them.

(1 Maccabees 8:20) 
Therefore, we decided to write to you.

(1 Maccabees 8:21) 
Therefore, if anyone intends war against you in our land, we will fight for you, for as long as is necessary.

(1 Maccabees 8:22) 
And if they intend war against you, we will similarly fight for you.

(1 Maccabees 8:23) 
Therefore, they sent the letters to this effect, to the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:24) 
In the one hundred and forty-sixth year, and the beginning was in these matters, which the Jews, and those who were in Jerusalem, sent to the Romans, so that there might be friendship and alliance for them.

(1 Maccabees 9:1) 
During this time, Antiochus returned with his army from Persia and came into the city of Antioch.

(1 Maccabees 9:2) 
After entering, he took Lysias, the first of his ministers, and commanded him to lead an army, go to Judea, and destroy it.

(1 Maccabees 9:3) 
He sent him with troops, chosen men, and the king's officials. Lysias went with the army and came near Judea, near Emmaus.

(1 Maccabees 9:4) 
The Jews heard about their gathering. They gathered and placed with them Agathon and Judeus, brave men chosen for the fight.

(1 Maccabees 9:5) 
When they saw the army, they were afraid and went out of the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:6) 
The men with Lysias went to battle, and about five hundred men fell from their army.

(1 Maccabees 9:7) 
They saw that their forces had fallen and retreated to their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:8) 
Judas and his brothers saw that the wicked had diminished in strength, so they went against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:9) 
They fought and killed about eight thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 9:10) 
They scattered the rest in the camp, and all fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:11) 
Judas, hearing this, began to act bravely and, with a fortified spirit, sent chosen men to war.

(1 Maccabees 9:12) 
Simon also came with an army against Bethsura, and he fought and besieged it for a long time.

(1 Maccabees 9:13) 
But he was not able to capture it.

(1 Maccabees 9:14) 
Lysias heard that Judas and his brothers, very strong men, had done this, and that the entire multitude of the people and all their forces were gathering around them.

(1 Maccabees 9:15) 
He was very afraid and considered going to Galilee before fighting against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:16) 
He prepared and came into the region of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:17) 
Judas was with him, as was all the people, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 9:18) 
When they rushed upon them and engaged, they fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:19) 
All those in the camp fled to the borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:20) 
About three thousand men fell by the sword from their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:21) 
Judas pursued them.

(1 Maccabees 9:22) 
And he returned to the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:23) 
Then Judas gathered them in Galilee and fought against them until he conquered all of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:24) 
And John, who was called Esceneus, coming from the camp,

(1 Maccabees 9:25) 
Judas and his brothers went up to the mountain and fought.

(1 Maccabees 9:26) 
They killed Simon and his brothers, and John.

(1 Maccabees 9:27) 
And they gathered in the camp, and when they heard, they came with many men. They stayed there through the night and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:28) 
When Jonathan and Simon heard this, they retreated with those who were with them to the desert of Thecoe and camped near the water of the camp. They sent men to them from the camp in Thecoe.

(1 Maccabees 9:29) 
And when Jonathan heard, they turned back and struck in the camp; and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 9:30) 
Simon and those with him went out, joined the battle, and scattered and struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 9:31) 
And Jonathan, with his brothers and his own men, went into the camp to battle and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:32) 
And Jonathan and those with him, in the city, and in the city, and those who were there died.

(1 Maccabees 9:33) 
And they went out, struck, and captured everything in it.

(1 Maccabees 9:34) 
And it came to pass on the first day, there were about two thousand men; and on the second day, there were about four thousand.

(1 Maccabees 9:35) 
And seeing Jonathan and those who were with him, they fought against them, and they went out with their own, and with many men, and extended their hands and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:36) 
And about eight thousand men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 9:37) 
And Jonathan and those with him returned and took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 9:38) 
When he returned and came to Antioch, Lysias gathered and gave the opinion in council to the wise men.

(1 Maccabees 9:39) 
And they said that it should not happen anymore and that he should release them. They decreed that they should release them and depart from their borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:40) 
And it came to pass that in that year, Judas and his brothers went out, chose men, and sent them to Rome to make friendship and alliance with them, and to remove the yoke from themselves and the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:41) 
And the word pleased them, and they commanded the men who were sent to make friendship with them.

(1 Maccabees 9:42) 
And they sent letters to Judas and his brothers, saying: "To the people of the Jews and their brothers, greetings, friendship, and help.

(1 Maccabees 9:43) 
And it came to pass, and they decreed that they would give them help and depart from the kingdom of the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:44) 
And they wrote on bronze tablets and sent them to Rome, so that there would be a memorial of the friendship with them and with the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 9:45) 
And it came to pass, after these things, that Antiochus sent to the region of Persia and gathered a large army.

(1 Maccabees 9:46) 
And he went into Persia, and those who believed in his power were with him.

(1 Maccabees 9:47) 
They came to the city called Elymais and wanted to take the temple and guard the city.

(1 Maccabees 9:48) 
But they could not, because the plan of the city was revealed to them.

(1 Maccabees 9:49) 
And those in the city drove them out.

(1 Maccabees 9:50) 
And it came to pass that they returned to Babylonia again.

(1 Maccabees 9:51) 
And a messenger came to him in Persia, saying that the armies that were in Judea had fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:52) 
And those who had been sent to battle by the Jews had gone out and were scattered in the camps.

(1 Maccabees 9:53) 
And Antiochus considered that he would come immediately into Judea and decided to set out and prepare everything with anger.

(1 Maccabees 9:54) 
And while he was saying this, it happened that he was struck immediately and released. He fell on the mountains.

(1 Maccabees 9:55) 
And they received him, and he was on a bed, paralyzed.

(1 Maccabees 9:56) 
And he was dying, and he cried out, recognizing, and said: "I am dying in great misery.

(1 Maccabees 9:57) 
And as he was dying, he heard that the soldiers in Persia had been scattered, and that they were being pursued and killed.

(1 Maccabees 9:58) 
And when he heard the word, he cried out: "I go, and I depart, all of mine." And he went into Persia and died.

(1 Maccabees 9:59) 
And they buried him, and his son Antiochus reigned in his place.

(1 Maccabees 10:1) 
In the one hundred and sixtieth year, Simon, the brother of Jonathan, declared himself to be High Priest, succeeding his brother Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 10:2) 
In those days, Judas was fighting against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 10:3) 
And the people of Israel gathered together.

(1 Maccabees 10:4) 
Seeing that the people were seeking and in fear, Simon took action.

(1 Maccabees 10:5) 
And he chose men and sent them to King Demetrius, to ask him to withdraw the decrees he had issued against the Jews, and against the land of Judea, and to release those who were held captive in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:6) 
And King Demetrius sent them, according to the words he had spoken to them, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 10:7) 
And he wrote letters to the Jews, saying: “King Demetrius to the people of the Jews, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 10:8) 
“Because we remember you, the Jews, and your friends, and have made arrangements in accordance with them, and have received what you have done for us.”

(1 Maccabees 10:9) 
“Therefore, we have judged it right to write to you and the other Jews, saying: 'All those from Judea who come to us up to this day, let them have peace, and be without any trouble.'

(1 Maccabees 10:10) 
“And we declare all the Jews who have departed from your land up to this day, to be free from taxation and from all the tributes of the land.

(1 Maccabees 10:11) 
“Concerning all the tributes, and the salt tax, and the crown taxes which belonged to us, we release all of them and give them to you and the other Jews.

(1 Maccabees 10:12) 
“And anyone of you who is inscribed in our books, let them be your people, and those of you who have come to this day, let them be with you.

(1 Maccabees 10:13) 
“And I command the Alexandrians and all my officials: To assist you in these matters, and to establish your peace.

(1 Maccabees 10:14) 
“And what the Jews have determined for you up to this day, I also establish. And I have removed the taxes which they paid in the earlier days.”

(1 Maccabees 10:15) 
“And these things I write to you, I do for you and the other Jews, and I establish all peace in your land.”

(1 Maccabees 10:16) 
In the one hundred and fifty-fourth year, the Jews in Judea, the sons of Israel who were in captivity, departed and returned and rebuilt.

(1 Maccabees 10:17) 
And they crowned Mount Zion, and those who were with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:18) 
And the sons of Alexander, who were in Macedonia, came and established Ptolemy as king.

(1 Maccabees 10:19) 
And King Ptolemy sent to Simon the High Priest, to give him honor.

(1 Maccabees 10:20) 
And he did this. And he appointed him and his friends, and gave him many gifts, and confirmed his friendship with them, and appointed him as High Priest, and for all things that pertained to him.

(1 Maccabees 10:21) 
And they captured the city called Gazara, Ptolemy and Simon.

(1 Maccabees 10:22) 
And they fought against it a great deal, and they set it on fire, and plundered all its spoils.

(1 Maccabees 10:23) 
And they put to death the inhabitants of Gazara, and exterminated all the wickedness there.

(1 Maccabees 10:24) 
And the Jews came with Simon to Jerusalem, and they purified it, and cast out all that was unclean, and they made good inhabitants there.

(1 Maccabees 10:25) 
And on the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, they entered it with praise and palms, and with lyres, cymbals, psalteries, hymns and canticles.

(1 Maccabees 10:26) 
And they established a day each year, so that they would celebrate this day as a day of joy.

(1 Maccabees 10:27) 
And they established the land of Judea, and the priesthood, and the people, and the garrisons, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:28) 
And Simon said to himself and to his friends: “Because if those on our side fight, and if enemies come, we will not be able to resist, because of the war.”

(1 Maccabees 10:29) 
And he established Judea, and built in Jericho, and in Galilee, and in Hazor, and in Emmanuel, and in Bethsura, and in Bethlehem, and in all the places which he fortified.

(1 Maccabees 10:30) 
And he fortified them, and placed garrisons in them, and stored provisions in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:31) 
And Simon gathered all the men of war, and placed garrisons, and stored weapons in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:32) 
And John and all those who were in Judea made peace with him.

(1 Maccabees 10:33) 
And the people saw that Simon was working for their salvation, and they gave him honor and glory.

(1 Maccabees 10:34) 
And they made him a leader and High Priest, and all the Jews made him their friend.

(1 Maccabees 10:35) 
And they declared him to be in charge of all, and of all the affairs of the land, and of the weapons.

(1 Maccabees 10:36) 
And Simon heard that the Romans had heard from the Gentiles, that they had heard that they were more powerful, and they agreed to everything that was commanded to them.

(1 Maccabees 10:37) 
And they gave their friendship to Simon, and they accepted his alliance.

(1 Maccabees 10:38) 
And they sent to them, and established for him a golden shield, and gave him honor, so that he might be with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:39) 
And the people heard these words, and said: “How shall we give him honor?

(1 Maccabees 10:40) 
And they resolved to give him a great praise, and to honor him, and to glorify him.

(1 Maccabees 10:41) 
And all the Jews did this: And they made him a leader and High Priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 10:42) 
And he was in charge of the Jews, and all the priests, and all the people.

(1 Maccabees 10:43) 
And furthermore, all the affairs of the land, and the wars, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works.

(1 Maccabees 10:44) 
And they established in him all things, as before.

(1 Maccabees 10:45) 
And all the people rejoiced in his works.

(1 Maccabees 10:46) 
And as Simon worked with honor and glory, in the land and in Jerusalem, so he established all the peoples in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:1) 
In the one hundred and fiftieth year of the kingdom of the Greeks, the Romans went to Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, saying that he should give them help and take them out of the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:2) 
Then King Ptolemy answered, "I am the king of Egypt. I have come to my own land, and I have given them help, and I have restored the land to the city, and you shall not depart from me."

(1 Maccabees 11:3) 
And a war was fought against Alexander, because the Romans were in everything with Ptolemy, and Ptolemy prevailed and they departed from the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:4) 
And Ptolemy gathered all his forces and came into Syria and took many cities and killed them.

(1 Maccabees 11:5) 
And he sent a great letter to Simon and made an appointment with him in Ammathunte, which is near the mountain, that he should come to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:6) 
And he went to him and saw his glory, his army, and his equipment and was afraid, and he acted against him and did not want to do him harm.

(1 Maccabees 11:7) 
And they said to him that they would do whatever they wished against Simon, and make him king, and whoever was their friend or enemy.

(1 Maccabees 11:8) 
And because Simon saw that he was angry, he was afraid and laid his hands on him, and did him violence, for he was an old man.

(1 Maccabees 11:9) 
And they killed him and his sons and his brothers. And he sent and sent his army and killed them and inflicted violence on them.

(1 Maccabees 11:10) 
And war was made, and the children of Israel went out of the field and came to the place of battles, and he was angry and prevailed.

(1 Maccabees 11:11) 
And Alexander, the king of Syria, hearing of this, gathered all his forces together and came into Syria.

(1 Maccabees 11:12) 
And he gathered a very large army and prevailed against Ptolemy and drove him from his land.

(1 Maccabees 11:13) 
And Alexander fought a war in the land, and those from the strongest cities came to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:14) 
And he gave him a very strong city, and he made him the leader of all who were around him.

(1 Maccabees 11:15) 
And Jonathan, hearing of this, sent ambassadors to him, asking him to make friendship with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:16) 
And he was accepted by him and sent letters to him saying:

(1 Maccabees 11:17) 
King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 11:18) 
We have heard of you that you are a man powerful in virtue and that you deserve to be our friend.

(1 Maccabees 11:19) 
Therefore, we have appointed you today to be a high priest and one of the king's friends.

(1 Maccabees 11:20) 
And he sent him a purple cloak and a golden crown, and he gave them to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:21) 
And Jonathan put them on, and was in the day of the feast of the seventh month, and began to go out to the people and sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 11:22) 
And King Alexander, hearing this, made him a friend, even before he was with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:23) 
And he wrote to him, saying: "Why have you given your people the law, and made a covenant with the Romans?"

(1 Maccabees 11:24) 
And he was very angry and acted against him, and Alexander, hearing this, gathered great forces.

(1 Maccabees 11:25) 
And he commanded Jonathan and brought him before the king in Ptolemais. And the king came and met him and fought.

(1 Maccabees 11:26) 
And they fled from Ptolemais and pursued them to the gates, and about three thousand men fell from Ptolemais.

(1 Maccabees 11:27) 
And Jonathan took Alexander's sword, and they went out of the city and fled.

(1 Maccabees 11:28) 
And Jonathan fought in Bethsura, and they came together in battle.

(1 Maccabees 11:29) 
And Alexander sent letters to Jonathan in peace. And Jonathan sent to him, for he was acting in peace and to him, in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:30) 
And King Alexander put Jonathan in honor and gave him possessions and divisions.

(1 Maccabees 11:31) 
And Jonathan went out to Ptolemais, and King Alexander met him, and he honored him greatly.

(1 Maccabees 11:32) 
And he took him and they met and slept together.

(1 Maccabees 11:33) 
And Alexander went out and went into Egypt and reigned.

(1 Maccabees 11:34) 
And Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, died, and he made his son Philip reign, who was in Egypt for eighteen years.

(1 Maccabees 11:35) 
And Philip died, and Demetrius reigned.

(1 Maccabees 12:1) 
In the year one hundred and forty-four, those who were in Rome sent greetings to the people of Macedonia and to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:2) 
The Jews in Judea received this message.

(1 Maccabees 12:3) 
They also sent to the Romans, Athenians, Chaldeans, and all the nations gathered in the same place in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:4) 
This is a copy of the letter: "The Jewish brothers send greetings and prosperity to the people of Rome.

(1 Maccabees 12:5) 
If you are well, we are well.

(1 Maccabees 12:6) 
Because of the war we had with Philip and those who were with him, we have had to deal with various events, which concerned both you and us.

(1 Maccabees 12:7) 
You sent us a letter and we sent you one also, asking that we might confirm our treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:8) 
So, at the time we wrote to you, we wrote to our Jewish brothers and your priests. We asked them not to ignore but to observe these things.

(1 Maccabees 12:9) 
We are hoping what we have agreed upon is what you agree upon also.

(1 Maccabees 12:10) 
Therefore, we are sending you Antiochus and Jason, the sons of Jason, and the Romans sent them to you to confirm what we have written, and for you to confirm what we have written.

(1 Maccabees 12:11) 
And now, farewell.""

(1 Maccabees 12:12) 
This letter was written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:13) 
They wrote to those who were in Judea, and to the Jews who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 12:14) 
"Jewish brothers, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 12:15) 
The people of Rome and the Jews wish you peace and prosperity forever. May God grant you grace, both now and in the future.

(1 Maccabees 12:16) 
The Romans sent envoys to us to confirm friendship and a treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:17) 
They established decrees so that we, our people, you, and your land would not wage war.

(1 Maccabees 12:18) 
Therefore, if war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:19) 
Likewise, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:20) 
We have confirmed these things just as they decreed.

(1 Maccabees 12:21) 
These words were written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:22) 
Then they sent letters to King Demetrius and to every nation in Asia, and to those in Judea, and to those at peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:23) 
Jewish brothers, greetings, prosperity, and health.

(1 Maccabees 12:24) 
Demetrius and his ancestors have made peace with you and the Jewish people.

(1 Maccabees 12:25) 
We have confirmed these words we wrote to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:26) 
So, if you want to make a treaty with us, write to us, and we will write to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:27) 
The people confirmed that Demetrius had granted us peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:28) 
For King Demetrius saw that the Jewish people belonged to God, and that they fought against those who opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 12:29) 
He included them among his friends and sent them honors.

(1 Maccabees 12:30) 
This was during the days when they wrote to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:31) 
At the command of the Romans, letters were sent to the Jews, saying, "Greetings and prosperity to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:32) 
The people of Rome and their allies send peace, strength, and prosperity to the Jewish nation forever.

(1 Maccabees 12:33) 
If war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:34) 
Again, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:35) 
These words, written, we sent them to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 13:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-ninth year, King Demetrius wrote letters to Simon the high priest and leader of the people, and to his friends, and to the Jewish people, both those in Judea and those in other lands, offering greetings of peace.

(1 Maccabees 13:2) 
The letters read: “King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:3) 
“Because of the troubles the Jews had caused, we have decided, though with much pain, to acknowledge their strength, courage, and honor. So we will do as the Jews wish.”

(1 Maccabees 13:4) 
“Therefore, we decree to them and their friends, and to the land of Judea, freedom and release: and we let go and forgive them all things which the Jews have taken until this day, and all the crimes they committed.”

(1 Maccabees 13:5) 
“Let all that they did through ignorance or in secret be forgiven.”

(1 Maccabees 13:6) 
“We will provide for the construction of the Temple and the repair of its walls, as well as the other expenses that were required.”

(1 Maccabees 13:7) 
“Furthermore, the Jews will be free to do whatever they want.”

(1 Maccabees 13:8) 
“We grant them permission to use grain, weapons, and the other supplies and tributes given to them, for the building of Jerusalem.”

(1 Maccabees 13:9) 
All of these decrees were written in public records, and they made Simon the leader, to be the high priest, with the care of the Temple, and to give him great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:10) 
The people heard these words and said, “Great is the faithfulness of Simon and his sons.”

(1 Maccabees 13:11) 
And because all the people and the priests agreed, they chose Simon to be their leader and priest.

(1 Maccabees 13:12) 
He was to have care of the Temple and its ministers and be in charge of everything.

(1 Maccabees 13:13) 
They also decided to write in the public records and place in a holy place that Simon was their leader, and this was to last forever. And everyone did him homage.

(1 Maccabees 13:14) 
The Jews made a covenant with Simon that, as long as he lived, he would be their leader and high priest, and his sons as long as they lived.

(1 Maccabees 13:15) 
They refused to deal with the other nations and their wicked ways.

(1 Maccabees 13:16) 
Simon built fortresses in Judea and fortified them with defenses and weapons and gathered troops.

(1 Maccabees 13:17) 
And he sent peace to King Demetrius.

(1 Maccabees 13:18) 
In turn, King Demetrius heard him, confirmed his position, and recognized his authority.

(1 Maccabees 13:19) 
He gave him testimony, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 13:20) 
He also learned that the Romans and Spartans sent envoys to him to make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:21) 
They met, made an alliance, and established a treaty with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:22) 
He also heard that the Romans sent to him envoys, excellent and most beloved men, with great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:23) 
And they sent them to him to confirm the alliance and the treaty they had made with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:24) 
They sent him letters on bronze tablets, in which was written: “The people of Rome and the Spartans to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:25) 
“We have received the letters and tablets that you sent to us.

(1 Maccabees 13:26) 
“And we have established a treaty and alliance with you, and we write saying: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:27) 
“If we wage war against you, your people, and your land, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 13:28) 
“This is the testimony of these words which we send to you. And we have written them on bronze tablets and placed them in a holy place so that we may keep them with you there.”

(1 Maccabees 13:29) 
And this is the example of the writing that was sent by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 13:30) 
The Romans and Spartans, to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:31) 
We have sent our envoys to you to make an alliance and treaty with you, and it has pleased us to do so.

(1 Maccabees 13:32) 
And this is what is written on the bronze tablets that we have written: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:33) 
“And if they first wage war against us, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 14:1) 
In the one hundred and sixty-ninth year of the world, the Romans, at the right moment, sent to Simon the high priest, the leaders of the Jewish people, and the senate of the Jews to treat of peace and establish alliances.

(1 Maccabees 14:2) 
They sent this message: "We have come to you and to your people because of your honor and glory. We seek a partnership and friendship with you.

(1 Maccabees 14:3) 
We now wish to take up arms and offer help to you against all your enemies."

(1 Maccabees 14:4) 
Their words were well received by the people and the priests.

(1 Maccabees 14:5) 
So the people said, "Let us ask Simon to make peace with us!" And they made peace with them.

(1 Maccabees 14:6) 
Simon welcomed them and appointed them as leaders and officials. He gave them weapons and help.

(1 Maccabees 14:7) 
Simon told the people, "We and our brothers and the family of our father fought many battles and struggles. We faced many hardships for the Law and the sanctuary, and we were saved.

(1 Maccabees 14:8) 
Therefore, today we hold the power.

(1 Maccabees 14:9) 
In this same year, Demetrius was taken captive. The Jews then gathered and went to Demetrius to honor him.

(1 Maccabees 14:10) 
Demetrius sent a message to them, gathered his army, and said, "I and my brothers, and my father's family, fought for the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:11) 
When they came, we gave them help and granted them honor, Jerusalem, and all their possessions. I confirmed all of this and gave it to them.

(1 Maccabees 14:12) 
I confirmed all things that are and will be for as long as this continues."

(1 Maccabees 14:13) 
So all the men, all the leaders of the people, and the priests decided that Simon should be their friend and make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:14) 
They heard this and were pleased, and they decided to write it down on tablets and place them before their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 14:15) 
They wrote on the tablets: "In the one hundred and seventieth year, the Jews, priests, and the people have cast off the yoke of the Gentiles, along with all the abominations and great pride.

(1 Maccabees 14:16) 
They established Simon as their leader and high priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:17) 
He would be their leader and care for the sanctuary. He would be in charge of all their works.

(1 Maccabees 14:18) 
He would be in charge of the weapons, the fortifications, the vessels, and the works of the Temple.

(1 Maccabees 14:19) 
His sons would all hold positions of dignity and would succeed their father.

(1 Maccabees 14:20) 
Simon appointed his sons and gave them weapons and an army. He instructed them to conduct the war and establish armies in the land.

(1 Maccabees 14:21) 
They appointed Simon as the leader in Jerusalem so that he could build fortifications and guard them. He built high walls, great towers, a large house, and fortifications all around.

(1 Maccabees 14:22) 
Simon sent a message to Demetrius and gave him a golden crown and palm branches. He sent gifts from Jerusalem and the trees within it, and it was done.

(1 Maccabees 14:23) 
He struck the people and the people who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 14:24) 
He heard that the Romans and the people in the land of the Jews had heard that they had appointed Simon as their leader and high priest. He heard that Simon and his brothers had made an alliance with them, and that they had done it with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:25) 
They welcomed him and wrote it on bronze tablets to be placed on the Mount Zion. These are the examples:

(1 Maccabees 14:26) 
In the one hundred and seventy-second year, under Simon, the great high priest, leader, and governor of the Jews, and his brothers,

(1 Maccabees 14:27) 
the Jews had gathered after they had rebelled and fled from the land of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 14:28) 
They gathered and came to Jerusalem and ascended Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:29) 
They saw that the sanctuary had been defiled and polluted.

(1 Maccabees 14:30) 
They decided, and after they had purified themselves, they appointed Simon and gave him weapons.

(1 Maccabees 14:31) 
They established him as high priest and his sons forever, until a faithful prophet would arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:32) 
And it was throughout all the land of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:33) 
Then it happened that they rebuilt Jerusalem and the fortifications that were all around, and the house, and the walls around Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:34) 
And this is the example that was created in their days.

(1 Maccabees 15:1) 
Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, sent letters from Rome, written on tablets, to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to those in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:2) 
The words in the letter were these: “King Demetrius sends greetings to the Jewish nation, and to the Senate, and to the Jews who are in Judea, greetings and peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:3) 
“Because we remember your good spirit, and goodwill towards us, and the friendship and favor that you have shown towards us, and for this, we are glad.”

(1 Maccabees 15:4) 
“For this reason, we have decreed for you, and for your race, immunity from taxes, and we give to you whatever we give to other nations.”

(1 Maccabees 15:5) 
“And now, I release you, and the Jews, and the people of Jerusalem, and your borders, and I will rebuild the city, and I will restore the vessels, and whatever was taken from the Temple, I will return to you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:6) 
And quickly, he sent letters to Jonathan, saying thus:

(1 Maccabees 15:7) 
“King Demetrius to the brother Jonathan, and to the Jews, and to the Senate of the Jews, and to the rest who are with them, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:8) 
“Because we have heard you, and we have decreed as you have said, and we have commanded our servants who are with us, to make peace with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:9) 
“We will affirm the testimony which comes from us to you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:10) 
“That whatever you have decided with our people be ratified. But if there were any decrees made by those who didn't know, we will amend them.”

(1 Maccabees 15:11) 
“And now we have commanded our servants to speak with you in peace, and to obey you in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:12) 
And these letters were written in the one hundred and seventieth year, and in that year, the wars and battles ceased.

(1 Maccabees 15:13) 
And the king of the Romans heard that they had been sent into Judea, and said:

(1 Maccabees 15:14) 
“We also will send to those who are in Judea, and we will send to them who are in Judea, peace and friendship, so that they might be enrolled with Jonathan and with the Jews.”

(1 Maccabees 15:15) 
And he sent letters into Judea, and said: “The Senate of the Romans, to Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and happiness.”

(1 Maccabees 15:16) 
“If you have undertaken a war against us, we do not have one, because we do not fight with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:17) 
“Now, therefore, we know that you have been chosen as our friends and allies:”

(1 Maccabees 15:18) 
“And we have commanded that henceforth we will speak with you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:19) 
“Just as to our people, and in our kingdom, and whatever you send to us, we will do well for you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:20) 
And this which the Romans wrote to the Jews, on bronze tablets, so that they might have a reminder of peace and help, and they sent it to Rome, to have it with them.

(1 Maccabees 15:21) 
After this, indeed, Simon, also writing, sent to Jonathan his brother, and he was with him for the support of the wars, and he appointed the entire army and sent it to him.

(1 Maccabees 15:22) 
And Numenius, the son of Antioch, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, the envoys from Judea, heard that the Jewish people had been mistreated.

(1 Maccabees 15:23) 
And they began to search, and they wanted to kill those who were with Jonathan, but they could not:

(1 Maccabees 15:24) 
because Jonathan had been informed, and he delivered them, and they could not do anything against them.

(1 Maccabees 15:25) 
And they came to Gaza, and those who were in Gaza expelled them, and Jonathan and those with him shut them in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:26) 
And the Lord knew, and gave them into his hand.

(1 Maccabees 15:27) 
And he fought against them and those who had come, and all those who were with them on the land, and he set fire to the gates, which were around Gaza, and plundered them, and burned them.

(1 Maccabees 15:28) 
And they fought against them, and all who were with him, and killed them; and they took great spoils from them.

(1 Maccabees 15:29) 
And it happened that, when Demetrius heard that Jonathan and those with him had come to the camp against him, and were fighting, and had become very strong, and had routed them in battle,

(1 Maccabees 15:30) 
he was very angry.

(1 Maccabees 15:31) 
And immediately he sent, and gathered the strongest men, and gave orders, and the army came.

(1 Maccabees 15:32) 
And he came to Antioch, and appointed two commanders of his army against them, and against those who were with Jonathan, and commanded them to come quickly.

(1 Maccabees 15:33) 
And he came to Jonathan, and said: “We are against you.” And Jonathan and those with him went out to battle, and they fought.

(1 Maccabees 15:34) 
And they were sent into their camp, and those with Jonathan conquered all, and they fled.

(1 Maccabees 15:35) 
And Jonathan and those who were with him took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 15:36) 
And he struck those in Ashkelon, and those who were with him, and they went out from their land.

(1 Maccabees 15:37) 
And the next day, he went to Beth-zur, a fortified city, and they met him, and greeted him, and gave him and those who were with him many things.

(1 Maccabees 15:38) 
And King Demetrius, hearing these things, sent again to Beth-zur, and wrote letters:

(1 Maccabees 15:39) 
“Peace to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to the army:”

(1 Maccabees 15:40) 
“Because I have fought for you, and for your brothers, and for your sons, and I have caused them to come, and I have sent them to you, with all their belongings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:41) 
“Therefore, if any of them who are in Judea have fled from their places, and have come to me, I will vindicate them for you and for your brothers.”

(1 Maccabees 15:42) 
“And now I will appoint you as allies and friends, and I will send you to my court, so that you may see what is necessary for me.”

(1 Maccabees 15:43) 
And he sent into the city of Jerusalem, to give them gifts, and sacrifices, and pleasant things, and they granted and gave to them.

(1 Maccabees 15:44) 
And they received, and then, and they built with Jonathan, and with all his brothers, and with him who was in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:45) 
And they all saw the works of Jonathan, and that he fought, and endured most bravely, and all the labor, and they joined with him.

(1 Maccabees 15:46) 
And they chose him, and appointed him as their leader, and waged war with the nations, and with the nations, and in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:1) 
In the one hundred and fifty-ninth year, King Demetrius sent letters and gathered the people in a great multitude, and he entered the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:2) 
Upon hearing this, Jonathan ordered an army to go out of Jerusalem to confront him, and they attacked them.

(1 Maccabees 16:3) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace and with a great promise because he was growing weak.

(1 Maccabees 16:4) 
He said, “Let us strike first before they join with Alexander, and let us do these things to him.”

(1 Maccabees 16:5) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan, saying, “We will make you and your friends and your holy city great, and if you do these things for us, you will have whatever you ask of us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:6) 
Then Jonathan, in Jerusalem, supplied the people with weapons and said to them, “We will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:7) 
And Jonathan selected the men of war and prepared, and fought against Demetrius, and the army departed from the land, and the army that was with Demetrius came.

(1 Maccabees 16:8) 
And they came into the land of Judea, and Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace, and said, “Let us not do this to you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:9) 
And he gave him glory and confirmed him and all the prisoners he released.

(1 Maccabees 16:10) 
Then he came to Jerusalem and entered the house of the temple and heard that John, the son of Absalom, was in Gadara, and he stationed himself in Gadara.

(1 Maccabees 16:11) 
And he sent men from Gadara to take him, and those sent came and struck him and killed him.

(1 Maccabees 16:12) 
And as for the rest of the words of John, and his deeds, and the virtues which he did, are these not written in the book of the days of John?

(1 Maccabees 16:13) 
And there was great pride among the people, and they knew that John was dead.

(1 Maccabees 16:14) 
And they sent and apprehended and killed the sons of Jambri and those in Gazara, and after this, a fight began again in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:15) 
And Jonathan gathered all the people and went out to war, and he came to Casali and placed the camp there.

(1 Maccabees 16:16) 
And Simon sent and placed the camp opposite Casali, and they fought for many days.

(1 Maccabees 16:17) 
And those in Casali made peace with Jonathan and gave him their right hands, and he took them and went into Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:18) 
And Jonathan chose elders and sought counsel and gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:19) 
And Tryphon, hearing that Jonathan had gathered many troops, planned to kill him.

(1 Maccabees 16:20) 
And he came to Bethsan and went out against him, and Jonathan went to Bethsan with forty chosen men.

(1 Maccabees 16:21) 
And Tryphon knew, and he set an ambush there to kill him, and they were with him.

(1 Maccabees 16:22) 
And Jonathan said to Simon his brother, “Choose men and go out, and we will fight for our brothers, and their fear will not disturb them.”

(1 Maccabees 16:23) 
And he gave them weapons and said to them, “Fight until we die.”

(1 Maccabees 16:24) 
And Jonathan and those with him fought, and Simon and those with him fell.

(1 Maccabees 16:25) 
And the people were sorrowful and knew that Jonathan was dead, and they mourned for him, and they were...

(1 Maccabees 16:26) 
But he gathered all those who were in the land and gathered all those who were in the borders of Judea, to make war against those who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:27) 
And Simon went out and placed the camp against them, and they fought for many days, and they stationed themselves.

(1 Maccabees 16:28) 
And he took them and pursued them and struck the men of war and broke their hands.

(1 Maccabees 16:29) 
And he gathered and placed the camp against the city and built towers.

(1 Maccabees 16:30) 
And Simon and those with him took and gave them weapons of war and placed the camp, and they gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:31) 
And they gave them peace, and they went out of the land, and he took the city and cleansed it from defilement and brought inhabitants into it and built in it.

(1 Maccabees 16:32) 
And those who were in the land of Judea saw the works of Simon and the glory which he did for his people, and he gathered the elders and the older men.

(1 Maccabees 16:33) 
And they said to themselves, “Let us make Simon king and his sons and his people, and he will fight for us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:34) 
And these words pleased the people, and they made Simon king for all the days of his life and his sons until he died.

(1 Maccabees 16:35) 
And he made a pact with them and took the camps with them.

(1 Maccabees 16:36) 
And there was war in the land, and he ceased, and Simon was glorified and gave peace in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:37) 
And he built in Judea a great wall around Jerusalem and built high places and great towers around Jerusalem and around them.

(1 Maccabees 16:38) 
And he sent Jonathan into the army to gather and have weapons of war and gave them weapons of war.

(2 Maccabees 1:1) 
To the Jewish people in Egypt, from the Jewish people in Judea—greetings, good health, and peace.

(2 Maccabees 1:2) 
We pray that you are well and that all your affairs are flourishing.

(2 Maccabees 1:3) 
In this past year, we have seen King Demetrius in power, wearing the crown, working through his reign, and fighting battles.

(2 Maccabees 1:4) 
We Jewish people in Jerusalem are sending this letter to you, our brothers and sisters in Egypt, with greetings of peace.

(2 Maccabees 1:5) 
The Lord saved us from great danger, and we give Him great praise.

(2 Maccabees 1:6) 
Demetrius's enemies and his allies attacked us, engaging in battles.

(2 Maccabees 1:7) 
But our God did not abandon us; rather, He freed us from these dangers.

(2 Maccabees 1:8) 
When we fought, God was with us. Our enemies were defeated.

(2 Maccabees 1:9) 
In Jerusalem, the leaders and their armies were advancing towards the city.

(2 Maccabees 1:10) 
When they came near the battle, we cried out to the Lord, and He sent a great voice of thunder and an earthquake.

(2 Maccabees 1:11) 
The earth was shaken. They were terrified and fled.

(2 Maccabees 1:12) 
God threw them into confusion, and many of them were killed by their own soldiers.

(2 Maccabees 1:13) 
We took their spoils and killed more than twenty thousand men.

(2 Maccabees 1:14) 
We know that you are always acting kindly towards us, and towards all who live according to the Law, and who fight for the Law. We are always acting kindly towards you.

(2 Maccabees 1:15) 
And we also know that the wicked priest Menelaus sent Heliodorus, who was sent by King Seleucus to plunder the Temple.

(2 Maccabees 1:16) 
We were present in the city at that time, and we know the customs of the city, and what was happening.

(2 Maccabees 1:17) 
For when he was in Jerusalem, he appeared, and was present, and came from God Himself.

(2 Maccabees 1:18) 
While he was praying with the crowd, some men appeared to him who had never been seen before; they were in gold and wearing magnificent robes.

(2 Maccabees 1:19) 
Standing and speaking to Heliodorus and his companions, they said,

(2 Maccabees 1:20) 
“Heliodorus, obey this law.”

(2 Maccabees 1:21) 
When all the men who were with him were present, they were terrified and were on the verge of death. They were hopeful and prayed to the Most High not to destroy them.

(2 Maccabees 1:22) 
When he had gone forward, they were afraid and died. Those mentioned above, along with those present, then appeared in prayer to the Most High.

(2 Maccabees 1:23) 
Then a man appeared, saying to Heliodorus and his companions, and to those who had brought him,

(2 Maccabees 1:24) 
“Those present, believing and fearing, then joined with those who were with him.”

(2 Maccabees 1:25) 
When they arrived, they were with those who were believers. Then, in this moment, He was with them.

(2 Maccabees 1:26) 
When in Jerusalem, he saw the vision. From that place, and from Jerusalem, the vision was for all time.

(2 Maccabees 1:27) 
And we preach about Him, and we preach about you—according to the time. And in the present time, we preach about you, and in you, and in you, and in you.

(2 Maccabees 1:28) 
And because it has happened, and in Jerusalem it happened. The events have been fulfilled in every way.

(2 Maccabees 1:29) 
And in all of the events, the events, and the events, and in all things. The events, the events, the events, and the events.

(2 Maccabees 1:30) 
When they saw it, and when they saw it, and that which was, and that which was, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which.

(2 Maccabees 1:31) 
For Heliodorus, and those who were with him, were there, and were there, and were there, in Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 1:32) 
And in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days.

(2 Maccabees 1:33) 
To you, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all.

(2 Maccabees 1:34) 
Therefore, knowing and believing in the Lord always, and with God, and believing, and believing, and believing.

(2 Maccabees 1:35) 
And that with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with.

(2 Maccabees 1:36) 
To you, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things.

(2 Maccabees 2:1) 
The books of Nehemiah and the Acts of the Kings contain these same accounts, along with the writings about the kings and the prophets, and the accounts of David.

(2 Maccabees 2:2) 
The first book, that is, the book of Nehemiah, contains the history and the accounts of the kings, as well as the writings of the prophets.

(2 Maccabees 2:3) 
I collected the accounts of the kings, the writings of the prophets, and the accounts of David, and the sacred gifts of the kings.

(2 Maccabees 2:4) 
The books of those who wrote about David and the acts of Solomon are available.

(2 Maccabees 2:5) 
Thus, a history was compiled to instruct those who want to learn and those who are abroad.

(2 Maccabees 2:6) 
Both the author and those who carefully researched it, took great care.

(2 Maccabees 2:7) 
For not all writings, as in these, should be presented in this way, especially the historical accounts, because of the events described.

(2 Maccabees 2:8) 
The author then sent a short treatise, and he included those things that were relevant to the matter in order to be brief.

(2 Maccabees 2:9) 
Diligence must be given to those who read, but to those who write, the ability to speak and the diligence of investigation into the subject itself.

(2 Maccabees 2:10) 
Therefore, we will now discuss what should be done with these things, and having made this preface, we will begin the present discourse.

(2 Maccabees 2:11) 
When Judas Maccabeus waged war, he chose to honor his fallen soldiers, and he secretly sent some of his friends to retrieve the bones of those who had fallen.

(2 Maccabees 2:12) 
They were brought under their tunics, and they carried them to Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 2:13) 
And they placed them in the tombs of their fathers, in a place that was revealed to them.

(2 Maccabees 2:14) 
On the day of the feast, when the children of Israel were rejoicing, they prayed and implored that the sins which had been committed would be forgiven.

(2 Maccabees 2:15) 
Judas and the leaders, along with the people, prayed and implored that sin would be blotted out completely.

(2 Maccabees 2:16) 
For the glorious deeds and the valiant actions in war, the Jews and their brothers, did not seek honor, but faith.

(2 Maccabees 2:17) 
For they saw it as good and honorable to fight to the death and to give their lives for those things that pertain to God.

(2 Maccabees 2:18) 
Therefore, as we were writing the remaining works from Jason of Cyrene, and from those things that especially pertain to Judas, we ourselves, for the sake of brevity, have made this preface.

(2 Maccabees 2:19) 
Jason of Cyrene wrote five books about Judas Maccabeus and his brothers, about the purification of the great temple, the consecration of the altar, the wars against King Antiochus Epiphanes, and the cause for liberty.

(2 Maccabees 2:20) 
And about those things that were done against him and those who were with him, and about the things that were accomplished.

(2 Maccabees 2:21) 
And about the battles against the Greeks in Persia, and in the place called Garisa, and other such events, he includes all of these things individually.

(2 Maccabees 2:22) 
Therefore, we attempt to summarize these events in a short form, and we give our attention to those who wrote and those who read.

(2 Maccabees 2:23) 
And I say this to the reader, and to those who read, so that they may be able to understand more easily.

(2 Maccabees 2:24) 
And we will say these things at the end, as in the beginning, and in the middle, and in the end.

(2 Maccabees 3:1) 
While the holy city was living in peace, and the laws were being observed in the best way possible due to piety, there was hatred because of evil.

(2 Maccabees 3:2) 
It happened that some of the citizens, specifically Philip, a man from the region of Syria, and the same man put in charge of the city, became very angry; but also Jason with his followers, who wickedly corrupted the just law and a holy life,

(2 Maccabees 3:3) 
were commanding that the holy temple in Jerusalem be moved, and that the sacred offerings, money, and revenues, which had been given by holy men, and which were provided by good men, be taken away.

(2 Maccabees 3:4) 
The one who was in charge, Onias, who was placed in charge as the High Priest, and a good and gentle man, and who hated evil, said

(2 Maccabees 3:5) 
to King Ptolemy, who was in Alexandria, that he would rebuke these men for the illegal things they had done.

(2 Maccabees 3:6) 
But when they arrived, and remained in the same city, by the providence of God, men were sent from the people, to handle the business of money.

(2 Maccabees 3:7) 
When they came to Philip and his associates, they were asked to give money for the business, and they immediately begged them not to do anything unjust.

(2 Maccabees 3:8) 
But because they insisted on this, and spoke against all the requests, then Onias, who was in charge as the High Priest, shouted, saying, "These are the ones who were insulting the temples in Jerusalem, and stealing the money of the poor"

(2 Maccabees 3:9) 
for which reason, they and their children, who were righteous according to the holy law, and with Onias, the High Priest, and others who were of the priesthood.

(2 Maccabees 3:10) 
Then Philip and his associates, because they were not able to achieve anything concerning this matter, struck them with anger, and sent all of them, who had spoken against the evil, to Ptolemy.

(2 Maccabees 3:11) 
When the king was angry with them, and ordered the wicked to be tortured, and that they should be scourged in Jerusalem, and he gave them all those things, except for what they had wickedly done in the city,

(2 Maccabees 3:12) 
But Onias, when he heard that they were suffering unjustly, begged and pleaded for them, because they were from the people, and he pleaded for them.

(2 Maccabees 3:13) 
This is the very same thing that happened in Jerusalem, it came to pass, while Heliodorus, appointed by King Seleucus, and placed in charge of the treasury, was entering the city in order to receive the money.

(2 Maccabees 3:14) 
And when he approached, with the whole army, and with the intent of the city, Heliodorus was seen, who was appointed by the king, and with the power to do evil.

(2 Maccabees 3:15) 
However, the priests and the whole multitude were present at prayer, and they were calling upon Him, who gave the law, and for those who preserved holy things.

(2 Maccabees 3:16) 
Then the High Priest, and all the multitude, with tears, and with prayer, begged that he who was appointed, should be saved, and that he who had been sent to do the work, would be preserved.

(2 Maccabees 3:17) 
But Heliodorus was already at the entrance to the treasuries, with the guard, and the custodians, who were around him.

(2 Maccabees 3:18) 
Then a man appeared to him in a frightening way, with terrible glory, and with weapons, he commanded that he rush into battle, and they struck him very severely.

(2 Maccabees 3:19) 
And when he thought he would enter more boldly, the treasuries, they came to him with scourges, and struck him, and threw him on the ground, with great fear.

(2 Maccabees 3:20) 
Those who were around him, then, and his limbs were bound, and he was tied up, so that he should do completely what he was ordered to do by the king.

(2 Maccabees 3:21) 
However, while he was lying on the ground, and enduring the most harsh torments, it happened that he himself was being forced to do all things.

(2 Maccabees 3:22) 
Meanwhile, while those in the temple were rejoicing, the whole multitude, and they were worshipping the all-powerful God, who saved the glory, who works miracles for everything.

(2 Maccabees 3:23) 
Heliodorus, however, when he had fallen, and was not able to rise, was sent with his companions, and they carried him, as if he were already dead.

(2 Maccabees 3:24) 
When they were in the place, and Heliodorus with his companions were at the king's garrison, then, those who had done this, asked him about those who had done this, and about the things he had done, and about the things he had carried out.

(2 Maccabees 3:25) 
However, he himself answered in their sight, that he seemed to be through the force of violence, and that it was as had been spoken by God.

(2 Maccabees 3:26) 
For when he was with the soldiers, who were around him, two very excellent young men appeared to him, and of great glory, who stood over him, and struck him very severely.

(2 Maccabees 3:27) 
And they who are in sight came to him, and in his eyes, and who then struck him.

(2 Maccabees 3:28) 
Therefore, when they were in the place, and in these things, all of those who were there, glorified the Lord, because he did wonderful things.

(2 Maccabees 3:29) 
However, those who were in the place, glorified God, and gave the gifts of thanks, in the temple, and to those who had been saved, for Heliodorus, who was dead.

(2 Maccabees 3:30) 
Heliodorus, however, promised to God, who was life, and saved him, and all those things that had come, and all those things that had been done, and had now perished, gave his hand to them.

(2 Maccabees 3:31) 
Onias, however, when he was no longer in life, and congratulated him on what God had saved him, and what he had given to him.

(2 Maccabees 3:32) 
Then the king, when he arrived at him, and at the Hebrews, who were from Jerusalem, and who were with great glory, and with great glory in peace, and gave them gifts of every kind, and blessed God.

(2 Maccabees 3:33) 
But also Onias, who was in charge as High Priest, who had been saved, prayed for all the people, and gave them peace, and gave them peace.

(2 Maccabees 4:1) 
It happened that when Antiochus, also called Epiphanes, entered the city, he wanted to quickly expel Heliodorus from his position. Heliodorus had returned without fulfilling his orders.

(2 Maccabees 4:2) 
Therefore, he sent Lysias, the commander of his army and the administrator of his affairs, to remove Heliodorus from his position.

(2 Maccabees 4:3) 
Upon hearing this, Heliodorus went to Ptolemais, gathered a large crowd there, and prepared to use deceit.

(2 Maccabees 4:4) 
For he brought forth accusations before the king against those of the city who were wicked.

(2 Maccabees 4:5) 
These were Jason and those with him who practiced impiety and drove out their fellow citizens.

(2 Maccabees 4:6) 
Nor was there innocent blood which did not cry out to God for vengeance.

(2 Maccabees 4:7) 
Therefore, immediately Lysias, encouraging the people, accused Ptolemais of the evils committed against the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:8) 
And he accused the king of all these things.

(2 Maccabees 4:9) 
Then Antiochus, enraged, immediately heeded the advice of Lysias.

(2 Maccabees 4:10) 
And he appointed Jason, without delay, to punish those who had attacked and to inflict punishment on the citizens.

(2 Maccabees 4:11) 
When Jason arrived, as soon as he appeared, he struck his own brothers and drove his enemies into exile.

(2 Maccabees 4:12) 
And he did not have power in the kingdom, nor great honor.

(2 Maccabees 4:13) 
Then Menelaus, as mentioned before, the brother of Jason, sold himself to the prince, through much money, and swore to be the king's friend.

(2 Maccabees 4:14) 
He sent Jason into the city with three men from the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:15) 
When they received the king's letters, they went to the king and explained the matter to him.

(2 Maccabees 4:16) 
Then Menelaus, in the absence of Jason, promised three hundred talents of silver, and seventy talents from other gifts, from every promise that was given.

(2 Maccabees 4:17) 
And he sought to obtain the priestly office.

(2 Maccabees 4:18) 
Therefore, the king gave it to Menelaus, and he took on the priestly office, ordering that Jason be brought to trial from the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:19) 
And he sent Jason to the city, sending him letters concerning what he had done and what he had accomplished.

(2 Maccabees 4:20) 
When he arrived, he was brought in by Menelaus, and when the people heard this, they immediately became angry at Jason and killed him.

(2 Maccabees 4:21) 
And Menelaus succeeded to the priesthood, yet he did not fulfill any priestly duties, nor did he care for the laws, nor did he consider judgments, but he did everything according to the will and pleasure of the king.

(2 Maccabees 4:22) 
Then Menelaus went with those who were wicked from the city, and they sent to the king and put them to death in the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:23) 
And when they came, many from the city were delivered to punishment, and the blood of many was shed because of the anger that had come from Jason's impiety.

(2 Maccabees 4:24) 
Antiochus, while preparing for an expedition into Egypt, heard that a disturbance had occurred in the city of Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 4:25) 
And that those who were with Jason had fled the city and had acted injuriously in the holy temple.

(2 Maccabees 4:26) 
When he heard this, he thought Egypt had been conquered, and he went up in a rage and seized the city, and ordered his soldiers not to spare anyone in the city and to kill those who were encountered.

(2 Maccabees 4:27) 
And entering the temple, he stole the gold and silver vessels, the utensils, and all the treasures he found there.

(2 Maccabees 4:28) 
And taking everything, he went back to his own land and committed a great slaughter.

(2 Maccabees 4:29) 
And there was great mourning and lamentation in Israel.

(2 Maccabees 4:30) 
And there were the leaders and elders who mourned and were grieved in spirit, and who sat at the gates of the city, who were distressed and filled with sorrow.

(2 Maccabees 4:31) 
It happened that those in the city, and those in the mountains, who were also robbers, and who had taken plunder, and all those in the city who had gathered to fight, and who were impious, and who did every evil deed.

(2 Maccabees 4:32) 
And the king ordered them to be in the temple, to be struck and killed, and those who were over all, and those in the temple who had killed, were killed, and then they came to war.

(2 Maccabees 4:33) 
And there were many of the impious over them, who were also wounded, and those who were in the city, and those who were in the temple, who were also killed.

(2 Maccabees 4:34) 
And he ordered throughout all the cities that all those who were in the city should make sacrifices and offer to idols.

(2 Maccabees 4:35) 
And from the temple in Jerusalem, they took away the altar and burned it, and they made seats, statues, and idols in it.

(2 Maccabees 4:36) 
And they sacrificed pigs on the altar and poured out blood, and there was no one to bury the dead.

(2 Maccabees 4:37) 
And great disgrace was cast upon them, and a great abomination was committed against Israel.

(2 Maccabees 4:38) 
And many fled from the city and left their wives, children, brothers, and parents, and went into the mountains, to hiding places, to caves, and to other solitary places.

(2 Maccabees 4:39) 
Then there were many who were dying and lying in the city and in the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 4:40) 
And great wrath was poured out upon them, and a great judgment took place.

(2 Maccabees 4:41) 
And Judas Maccabeus and those who were with him, on the mountain, and those who were with him, to fight against the impious, and to fight, and to strike, and to kill.

(2 Maccabees 4:42) 
And they gathered together and placed each one in his place, and they took up arms and said, "It is better for us to die than to see the wickedness of the wicked and the holy things defiled."

(2 Maccabees 4:43) 
And they went to war with the impious and killed them.

(2 Maccabees 4:44) 
And quickly the impious fled from their presence.

(2 Maccabees 4:45) 
And they pursued them and killed and destroyed the impious, and they took vengeance from their hands, and they purified the holy things.

(2 Maccabees 4:46) 
And they purified the temple, the altar, and all the vessels, and they hung up in it those things that were defiled.

(2 Maccabees 4:47) 
And they offered in it the burnt offering, praise, and glory, and they said, "Lord, Lord God, who made the universe and the earth, and who is the Lord of all things."

(2 Maccabees 4:48) 
Send now your spirit and sanctify us, and send your light and strike those who are impious and their deeds.

(2 Maccabees 4:49) 
And after these things, they pursued and established, and they took vengeance on all the nations, and they killed the impious.

(2 Maccabees 4:50) 
And after this, they had peace, and they did all things according to the law of God.

(2 Maccabees 5:1) 
Around this time, Antiochus came back from Persia and arrived in the city of Antioch.

(2 Maccabees 5:2) 
And when he entered, he wanted to go into the temple, and his enemies attacked him, causing a disturbance.

(2 Maccabees 5:3) 
Because he was forbidden to enter, he became angry and departed.

(2 Maccabees 5:4) 
Upon his return, his fury flared, and he ordered the Jewish temple to be struck without pause.

(2 Maccabees 5:5) 
Then, many people came out and gathered around him.

(2 Maccabees 5:6) 
He commanded the men to be prepared. Quickly they entered and struck the city, killing many.

(2 Maccabees 5:7) 
They seized many spoils and set the city on fire.

(2 Maccabees 5:8) 
They demolished homes and tore down the surrounding walls.

(2 Maccabees 5:9) 
They took women and children captive and seized livestock.

(2 Maccabees 5:10) 
In the Holy Temple, they plundered the gold, silver, and valuable vessels they found there.

(2 Maccabees 5:11) 
They took everything and went back to their own land, causing great slaughter.

(2 Maccabees 5:12) 
There was great mourning in Israel.

(2 Maccabees 5:13) 
The leaders and elders groaned; young men and girls mourned; and the women lost their beauty.

(2 Maccabees 5:14) 
Every groom assumed the lament, and the bride was as if in mourning.

(2 Maccabees 5:15) 
The lands trembled because of their inhabitants, and the whole house of Jacob was confounded.

(2 Maccabees 5:16) 
After two years, the king sent a tax collector to the cities of Judea, and he came to Jerusalem with a large multitude.

(2 Maccabees 5:17) 
He spoke words of peace, but he deceived them. He struck the city with a great plague.

(2 Maccabees 5:18) 
He killed many of the people and scattered their spoils.

(2 Maccabees 5:19) 
He took away the ornaments of Jerusalem and put them in his own cities, and he destroyed Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 5:20) 
He led women and children into captivity and took possession of the livestock.

(2 Maccabees 5:21) 
They built a city of David with a large, strong wall, solid towers, and it became a citadel for them.

(2 Maccabees 5:22) 
They placed a sinful people there, wicked men; and they established themselves within it.

(2 Maccabees 5:23) 
They put weapons there, gathered food, stored arms there, and they uttered blasphemies, making it a snare for them.

(2 Maccabees 5:24) 
They spread out before the temple, surrounded it on all sides, and it became a wicked enemy to them.

(2 Maccabees 5:25) 
They poured out the blood of the innocent around the sanctuary, and the sanctuary was defiled, and the sons of strangers were around the temple, and the gentiles lived with the prostitutes and worked with them.

(2 Maccabees 5:26) 
The Jews were not allowed to enter, nor to observe the law or the commandments of God, because of their wickedness.

(2 Maccabees 5:27) 
Also, all of its honor was taken away, and all its glory was turned into disgrace.

(2 Maccabees 5:28) 
And the temple of the gentiles was full of luxury, banquets, and fornications. Women were with the gentiles in the temple, and things were done both around and within the sacred things that were forbidden.

(2 Maccabees 5:29) 
And the heart of Judah was troubled, and as he departed from the temple, the whole city was full of confusion.

(2 Maccabees 5:30) 
And all the streets resounded with the voice of those crying out, and everyone groaned together.

(2 Maccabees 6:1) 
Not long after, the king sent elders from Athens to force the Jews to abandon their ancestral laws and to cease living according to God’s laws:

(2 Maccabees 6:2) 
They were to defile the Temple in Jerusalem, dedicating it to foreign gods, setting up altars and temples for those gods, and offering unclean pigs as sacrifices.

(2 Maccabees 6:3) 
When this happened, many in the Jewish population agreed with them, offering sacrifices to idols and violating the Sabbath.

(2 Maccabees 6:4) 
The king sent written commands by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judea, ordering them to follow practices that were foreign to their ancestral laws.

(2 Maccabees 6:5) 
They forced the people and gave them the commands to offer sacrifices to idols, defiling themselves through the sacrifices.

(2 Maccabees 6:6) 
But those who remained in Judea, and who were left behind, faced great tribulations because no one had the ability to escape from a given place.

(2 Maccabees 6:7) 
When this happened, many Jews agreed with them and sacrificed to idols in every way, profaning the Sabbath.

(2 Maccabees 6:8) 
Afterward, he brought about the deaths of many who did not agree, but persevered in Judaism and forbade such practices.

(2 Maccabees 6:9) 
On the fifteenth day of the month of Casleu, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they built the abominable idol in the Temple and in the cities of Judea all around.

(2 Maccabees 6:10) 
They sacrificed on the day of the idol’s birth and on the first day of each month, according to the king's command, at the altar.

(2 Maccabees 6:11) 
Those in Jerusalem were forced to pretend and to offer sacrifices, crowning themselves for Bacchus.

(2 Maccabees 6:12) 
But there was great sorrow over Israel.

(2 Maccabees 6:13) 
For those who pretended did not refuse to eat the unclean things.

(2 Maccabees 6:14) 
Therefore, many Jews fled to hide themselves and to attack those who were doing those things.

(2 Maccabees 6:15) 
And on the ninth day of the month of Casleu, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they rose up to offer sacrifices, sacrificing at the altar that was above the altar and they killed according to the king's command.

(2 Maccabees 6:16) 
The women who had circumcised their sons made themselves known, and they were hung by the neck throughout the city.

(2 Maccabees 6:17) 
And they destroyed others along with their families and those who were with them, and they killed them on every day.

(2 Maccabees 6:18) 
So, many Israelites decided in their hearts not to eat unclean things.

(2 Maccabees 6:19) 
They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food and to violate the holy law and so they died.

(2 Maccabees 6:20) 
And great wrath came upon them.

(2 Maccabees 6:21) 
Two women were also brought forth because they had circumcised their sons.

(2 Maccabees 6:22) 
When they seized their sons, they hung the women from their breasts, ripped them open, and killed their sons at the same time.

(2 Maccabees 6:23) 
But others, along with their sons, gave themselves up, and they died frequently.

(2 Maccabees 6:24) 
Then, the Lord was angry with them, because their sins were the cause.

(2 Maccabees 6:25) 
But Machabeus gathered those who were with him, hiding in the mountains and forests, and he struck those who were in Judea, attacking those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 7:1) 
This also happened: Seven brothers and their mother were arrested. The king tortured them with whips and cords to force them to eat pork, which the Law forbade.

(2 Maccabees 7:2) 
But the first brother said: "What do you want to know from us? We are ready to die rather than disobey the laws of our fathers."

(2 Maccabees 7:3) 
The enraged king commanded the fires and frying pans to be heated. He then ordered the brothers to be tortured by their tongues, hands, and feet.

(2 Maccabees 7:4) 
While they were enduring this torture, the other brothers said: "What are you looking for? What do you want to know? We are ready to die."

(2 Maccabees 7:5) 
The second brother, at the point of death by torture, said: "You wicked man, you may end our present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up again to eternal life because we die for His laws."

(2 Maccabees 7:6) 
After him, the third brother, who was mocked, quickly extended his tongue, and his hands with a courageous boldness, saying: "I received these from God, and because of His laws I despise them; and I hope to receive them again."

(2 Maccabees 7:7) 
Even the king and those with him were amazed at the youths' resolve. They despised the tortures and threw away their present life.

(2 Maccabees 7:8) 
When the third brother died, the fourth was tortured in the same way. As he was at the point of death, he said: "It is good to die at the hands of men, but we have hope of being raised again by God. But for you, there will be no resurrection to life."

(2 Maccabees 7:9) 
Then they brought the fifth brother and tortured him. But he, looking at the king, said: "Although you have the power of men, you are corruptible and you do what you will. Do not think that our race has been abandoned by God:"

(2 Maccabees 7:10) 
Hold on and see His great works, and how He will test them and punish you."

(2 Maccabees 7:11) 
Then the sixth brother said, as he was dying: "Do not be mistaken: for we suffer these things for ourselves because we have sinned against God, for which reason these wonders have happened to us."

(2 Maccabees 7:12) 
The mother was even more marvelous and worthy of memory. For she, when she saw one day in the presence of her seven sons dying, endured this courageously, and with a good spirit, she had hope in the Lord.

(2 Maccabees 7:13) 
Exhorting each of them in their native language, with wisdom, she united the youths’ understanding in piety. Saying: "I do not know how you appeared in my womb: for I did not give you spirit, soul, and sense, nor did I form each of you."

(2 Maccabees 7:14) 
But the Creator of the universe, who formed the birth of man, and who is the inventor of all things, He will restore spirit and life to you in mercy, just as you now despise your souls because of His laws."

(2 Maccabees 7:15) 
Antiochus, however, thought that he was being scorned, and suspected words of reproach. He tried to persuade the remaining son not only with words, but also with an oath, and with friendship, kindness, riches, and authority, and by making him renounce the laws.

(2 Maccabees 7:16) 
But since he did not care about anything, he summoned the mother and exhorted her to follow the youth’s advice and persuade him for his safety.

(2 Maccabees 7:17) 
But the mother, as he was persuading him much, and he was not obeying her, said: "My son, have mercy on me, who carried you for nine months in my womb, and nursed and raised you up to this age, and provided for you."

(2 Maccabees 7:18) 
I beg you, son, look at the universe and the earth, and everything in them, and consider: and know that God made them from nothing, and the race of men."

(2 Maccabees 7:19) 
So, do not fear this executioner, but, being worthy of your brothers, accept death so that I may receive you in mercy."

(2 Maccabees 7:20) 
While she was speaking these things, the youth said: "What are you waiting for? For I do these things, not obeying the commands of the fathers, but of God."

(2 Maccabees 7:21) 
And immediately, he was tortured, so that he might also die. As he died, he said: "Dying at the hands of men, but through the hope of resurrection from God, I am going to eternal life. But as for you, may you never rise again."

(2 Maccabees 7:22) 
After the brothers and the mother, he said: "But I, through the power of Him, am with you, and with the seed of my brothers, and with their souls."

(2 Maccabees 7:23) 
After these words, they and the mother received death in various ways.

(2 Maccabees 8:1) 
Judas Maccabaeus and his soldiers secretly entered the fortresses and called together their relatives. They gathered about six thousand men, including those who remained loyal in Judea and those who had deserted to join them.

(2 Maccabees 8:2) 
They prayed to the Lord to look with favor on the people and to see the injury they were suffering.

(2 Maccabees 8:3) 
They said to Maccabaeus: “What shall we do, now that God has given our enemies such power, to attack us?”

(2 Maccabees 8:4) 
Maccabaeus said in response: “Let us pray and call on the Lord. He may, perhaps, relent. He will do whatever He wishes, and if He doesn't, then He does as He wills.”

(2 Maccabees 8:5) 
After gathering the army and preparing for battle, he said: “It is better to die in battle than to see the evils of our people and our holy places.”

(2 Maccabees 8:6) 
This was the will of heaven.

(2 Maccabees 8:7) 
Then, exhorting them and giving them the watchword, he placed the most valiant men, fifty to a company, and put them in charge.

(2 Maccabees 8:8) 
He told them, “Don’t be afraid in this battle. Let us fight for our souls and avenge ourselves.”

(2 Maccabees 8:9) 
He gave the signal, and they attacked Nicanor in the center, who immediately fell in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:10) 
They fell together with the majority of the Syrian army, and the rest fled.

(2 Maccabees 8:11) 
They captured their spoils. They cut off Nicanor's head and his hand, which he had so proudly raised. They brought them and hung them near the fortress of Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 8:12) 
The Jews greatly rejoiced and glorified this day, and they decreed that this day should be celebrated annually.

(2 Maccabees 8:13) 
Then, gathering together, they said, “May God be praised, for He saves His people.”

(2 Maccabees 8:14) 
They attacked and struck down those who were with Timothy and Bacchides, who were besieging them. They inflicted a great defeat, and the enemy were wounded and fled.

(2 Maccabees 8:15) 
Judas Maccabaeus stationed men in Jerusalem, who were besieging the fortress. He also stationed men in Gazara, Beth-zur, and the fortress. And he put others in charge of other locations.

(2 Maccabees 8:16) 
Timothy and Bacchides then sent their troops to fight against the Jews and they met in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:17) 
In the battle that followed, about twenty thousand men of Timothy’s army were killed.

(2 Maccabees 8:18) 
But Timothy himself escaped with a few men, and they came to a certain fortress called Gazara, where Chereas was.

(2 Maccabees 8:19) 
Then the Jewish leaders with Maccabaeus laid siege to the fortress for twenty days, with a great assault.

(2 Maccabees 8:20) 
They set up siege towers, war machines, and catapults and they assaulted the place.

(2 Maccabees 8:21) 
Those inside fell into their hands. They set fire to the fortress and burned those inside, and they fell.

(2 Maccabees 8:22) 
Then they went to another fortress and fought against Timothy, who was there.

(2 Maccabees 8:23) 
He gathered about one hundred and twenty thousand men from his army and put him and the others with him in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:24) 
They fought against Maccabaeus, and as they were about to begin, about twenty thousand men of Timothy’s army were killed. Timothy fled to a fortress where his brother Chereas was.

(2 Maccabees 8:25) 
Then Maccabaeus and those with him besieged the fortress and struck it.

(2 Maccabees 8:26) 
Fearing them, Timothy immediately sent to them, promising to release them and all their possessions, and he swore he would never harm them in any way.

(2 Maccabees 8:27) 
Maccabaeus let them go, but not according to the promise. He killed Chereas, his brother, and Timothy, and he gave the fortress to the citizens.

(2 Maccabees 8:28) 
After this victory they went to Caraca and Charecensi, and to the Jews who were in that place. They thought they were not loyal, and they tried to attack them.

(2 Maccabees 8:29) 
But those inside, seeing their enemies fighting against them, cried out to Maccabaeus, begging him, and saying, “We are righteous, and we are not your enemies.”

(2 Maccabees 8:30) 
Crying out they gave testimony, saying, “We call God as our witness, and we are faithful to you and not to your enemies.”

(2 Maccabees 8:31) 
Maccabaeus received them in friendship and did not cease to harm them, but gathered their people, up to thirty thousand.

(2 Maccabees 8:32) 
He put them to work in the service of the Jews, and he returned with them to Jerusalem and freed the city.

(2 Maccabees 8:33) 
In Jerusalem, he killed those among them who had gone out, because they were in sins and had done evil.

(2 Maccabees 8:34) 
He placed a fortress in Jerusalem with men and fortified it, and they and others guarded it.

(2 Maccabees 8:35) 
And they sent troops to Beth-zur against them and attacked them, and they killed about five thousand men.

(2 Maccabees 8:36) 
Judas, seeing their deeds and their attack, gathered the people to praise the Lord, who saves Israel.

(2 Maccabees 8:37) 
He gathered them and went out against them and struck them.

(2 Maccabees 8:38) 
In the battle, he killed Ptolemy, the son of Dori, and those with him.

(2 Maccabees 8:39) 
He stationed troops in the fortress, and with all of Israel they praised him daily, who is their savior.

(2 Maccabees 9:1) 
So, King Antiochus then departed for the regions of Persia with a great army, because he heard that there was an army in Persia that was resisting him.

(2 Maccabees 9:2) 
For a great problem, which was being handled by the Greeks there, and because there were those in that region who opposed him.

(2 Maccabees 9:3) 
So he departed to Persia with those who were with him, and he heard that there was great wealth in the temple of Nanaea, in Persia.

(2 Maccabees 9:4) 
And he came, and he hoped to take the city, and to obtain the wealth. Because he sent to the city and he obtained it.

(2 Maccabees 9:5) 
So when Antiochus came, and those who were with him, the temple priests immediately came there, and they showed him the reason why they had come.

(2 Maccabees 9:6) 
And they said: “Behold, there is much wealth, which has been entrusted to us. But take it immediately, and do what has been commanded to you.”

(2 Maccabees 9:7) 
And he said, “Immediately, and with haste.” And he arranged it. But when Antiochus entered the temple, and those who were with him, the priests, carrying it, entered.

(2 Maccabees 9:8) 
And when Antiochus, and those who were with him, entered, immediately the temple priests, shouting, and at once in the ashes and on the ground, made a fire.

(2 Maccabees 9:9) 
And when this had been done, and this that was done, they perished, not moderately, and those who were with him, and he was struck by swords, and without fear.

(2 Maccabees 9:10) 
And the whole city, with great exultation, and all who were in it, did it to him.

(2 Maccabees 9:11) 
On the fourth day, he was in great pain, and those who were with him were saddened.

(2 Maccabees 9:12) 
And when this was done, those who were with him, who were his enemies, said: “How powerful and terrifying was this man!”

(2 Maccabees 9:13) 
And Antiochus died, in great pain, and he cried out.

(2 Maccabees 9:14) 
And it happened that many of those who were with him fell, and were killed, and those who were with him. And Philip, who was educated with Antiochus, spoke about his son, and brought him, and he reigned.

(2 Maccabees 9:15) 
And Philip reigned. And he was sick, and troubled, and all who were with him were saddened.

(2 Maccabees 10:1) 
Judas, who was called Maccabeus, and his companions went into the villages secretly, and then arrested those who were there. They gathered those who had not deserted from Judea until they met the forces opposing them.

(2 Maccabees 10:2) 
They called upon the Lord, terrified the surrounding nations, and attacked them. They burned down their fortress and captured it.

(2 Maccabees 10:3) 
When it was time for battle, Judas, forming his company, chose 3,000 men and sent them into battle against Bacchides and his army.

(2 Maccabees 10:4) 
Fearing Bacchides, they withdrew from the camp. Of the 3,000, only 2,680 men remained.

(2 Maccabees 10:5) 
When Judas saw those who had withdrawn, he pursued them.

(2 Maccabees 10:6) 
He turned them to fight, and killed 3,000 men. He then advanced to Bacchides' camp and fought.

(2 Maccabees 10:7) 
Bacchides, fearing his strength, crossed over to the place called Azotus, and then they went with him to fight Judas.

(2 Maccabees 10:8) 
A large crowd gathered and formed a council. They told those with Judas that Judas and his brothers had been killed.

(2 Maccabees 10:9) 
When Judas heard these words, as they were on their way, he said: "There shall be no mercy for me, but we shall break into them."

(2 Maccabees 10:10) 
He fought against them in the city and killed about 20,000 men. The rest they forced to flee into a castle in Azotus.

(2 Maccabees 10:11) 
Taking the spoils, they burned Azotus and everything in it. Then they returned to Judea.

(2 Maccabees 10:12) 
Bacchides and Judas met in the field called Bersa, with Judas having few men.

(2 Maccabees 10:13) 
The men with Judas were exhausted, and when they saw the large crowd, they were afraid and could not stand. Judas and his companions fought to the death.

(2 Maccabees 10:14) 
The men with Judas saw that his brothers and all who were with him had died. They followed them.

(2 Maccabees 10:15) 
They fled into the land.

(2 Maccabees 10:16) 
On the other side, Bacchides and his leaders set up camp and encamped in the land of Judea.

(2 Maccabees 10:17) 
The Jews mourned and said, "How have the strong ones perished, who saved Israel!"

(2 Maccabees 10:18) 
The rest of Judas’ deeds, his wars, and the acts of valor he performed are not written in this book, because they were too great.

(2 Maccabees 10:19) 
After the death of Judas, those who were not pious arose and stirred up all sorts of evil throughout all the borders of Israel.

(2 Maccabees 10:20) 
All wickedness gathered against them. Then those who committed sins arose, and evil conspiracies followed.

(2 Maccabees 10:21) 
A great famine occurred, and the land failed, and all the multitude gathered together. Then Simon rose up, fought for his people, and offered his life for his nation.

(2 Maccabees 10:22) 
He gathered his friends and sent them forth. He gathered those of his own family and strengthened them in justice.

(2 Maccabees 10:23) 
He multiplied the works of the people, and the land was glorified, and all evil was driven out of the land.

(2 Maccabees 10:24) 
He arose in the sight of his people and avenged his nation. He gathered the works of the people and avenged it.

(2 Maccabees 10:25) 
In his days, he prospered in his works and extended his borders.

(2 Maccabees 11:1) 
After this, Judas Maccabaeus and his men entered the villages in secret, and they summoned those in Judea who had not deserted to Philip. And they observed the Sabbath day.

(2 Maccabees 11:2) 
Later, they gathered and made war against Philip. After Philip was defeated and killed with great valor, and the rest who were with him...

(2 Maccabees 11:3) 
Judas and his brothers, along with the best of the Israelites, resolved on that day and followed this course:

(2 Maccabees 11:4) 
They said: “Behold, our enemies are defeated! Let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it.”

(2 Maccabees 11:5) 
Then, the whole multitude gathered and went up to Mount Zion.

(2 Maccabees 11:6) 
They saw the sanctuary deserted, the altar defiled, the gates burned, and plants growing in the courtyards as in a forest or a mountain, and the chambers destroyed.

(2 Maccabees 11:7) 
They tore their garments and mourned with a great lamentation; they put on sackcloth and placed ashes on their heads.

(2 Maccabees 11:8) 
And they fell to the ground and cried out with a loud voice to the universe.

(2 Maccabees 11:9) 
Then Judas ordered the men to fight against those in the fortress until they had cleansed the sanctuary.

(2 Maccabees 11:10) 
He chose priests without blemish and of good will, and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the stones of defilement to an unclean place.

(2 Maccabees 11:11) 
They considered what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which had been defiled.

(2 Maccabees 11:12) 
They gave good counsel to tear it down, lest it be reproached to them that the Gentiles had defiled it, and they demolished the altar.

(2 Maccabees 11:13) 
They placed the stones in a fitting place on the mountain of the house until, that is, a prophet should come and give an answer about them.

(2 Maccabees 11:14) 
Then they took whole stones according to the law and built an altar like the former one.

(2 Maccabees 11:15) 
And they built the sanctuary and the interior of the house, and they sanctified the courts.

(2 Maccabees 11:16) 
They made new sacred vessels and brought in the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:17) 
And they burned incense on the altar, and they lit the lamps that were on the lampstand, and they gave light in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:18) 
They placed the bread on the table and hung the veils, and they finished the work they had done.

(2 Maccabees 11:19) 
On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month was the dedication of the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:20) 
And they offered sacrifices with song, with harps, cymbals, and drums.

(2 Maccabees 11:21) 
And the priests fell on their faces before the temple during the dedication of the temple, and the Levites sang with harps and songs in a great chant.

(2 Maccabees 11:22) 
And all the people adored.

(2 Maccabees 11:23) 
And they sacrificed burnt offerings and offered sacrifices and peace offerings.

(2 Maccabees 11:24) 
And Judas celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and he offered burnt offerings and libations with joy and gladness.

(2 Maccabees 11:25) 
They also renewed the ornaments of the temple itself, both inside and out.

(2 Maccabees 11:26) 
On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year, they rose early.

(2 Maccabees 11:27) 
And they sacrificed according to the law on the altar of burnt offerings, which they had built.

(2 Maccabees 11:28) 
And according to the time and day when the Gentiles had defiled it, it was dedicated with songs, harps, cymbals, and drums.

(2 Maccabees 11:29) 
And all the people fell on their faces, and adored, and they blessed the one in the universe who had given them success.

(2 Maccabees 11:30) 
And they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days in joy, just as they were reminded of the feast of the tabernacles; because recently, they had lived in the tabernacles of the forests and endured wild beasts.

(2 Maccabees 11:31) 
Because of this, they cried out with firm shouts, and they implored the one who had given them success to preserve them to the end.

(2 Maccabees 11:32) 
And Judas and his brothers established for the whole community of the Jews that the days of the dedication of the altar should be celebrated annually with joy and gladness for eight days, at their appointed times.

(2 Maccabees 11:33) 
Moreover, this time, in which they were in Persia, and with King Artaxerxes, and in the time of Maccabaeus...

(2 Maccabees 11:34) 
And they sent letters to the Jews who were in Egypt, to all the provinces of the Jews, greetings from the Jewish brothers—to the Jews who were in Judea, and those who were, greetings.

(2 Maccabees 11:35) 
On the dedication of the altar, and on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year...

(2 Maccabees 11:36) 
We declare all the events that occurred in Maccabees and with his companions, and of their strength and great endurance.

(2 Maccabees 11:37) 
How they affected the Jews in war, and how they fought with courage for the Jewish law, how, for that reason, they were enemies, and how they purified the holy temple and the sanctuary, and they dedicated the altar.

(2 Maccabees 11:38) 
And we will narrate what was done about the others, and about these, in those same times.

(2 Maccabees 11:39) 
And let these things have been said in words; now, therefore, we will bring the speech to an end.

(2 Maccabees 12:1) 
But Judas Maccabaeus and his men prayed to the Lord, begging Him to send an enemy against their enemies.

(2 Maccabees 12:2) 
A surprise attack was launched against them, in which many were wounded, and the rest fled to the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 12:3) 
Then Simon, who was one of their leaders, took his men, and selecting some of their number, he sent them to the king to bring him into the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 12:4) 
He prepared a path for his men, anticipating the enemy, and rushed upon them.

(2 Maccabees 12:5) 
Those with Timothy saw this and, filled with fear, took refuge.

(2 Maccabees 12:6) 
They cried out to him and begged him to let them pass safely, for they were afraid.

(2 Maccabees 12:7) 
So he went to them and made peace with them, and they swore an oath that they would not cause any trouble.

(2 Maccabees 12:8) 
He struck Timothy and his men, and his brother Chereas, and the rest, and pursued them.

(2 Maccabees 12:9) 
They were prepared for war, and they gave battle from an ambush, and about twenty thousand men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:10) 
Timothy himself, and to his place, sent to prepare, and to another place against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:11) 
But Maccabaeus and those with him, divided into two groups, attacked those who were prepared, and they fought: and they were wounded, and the rest fled to the fortified places.

(2 Maccabees 12:12) 
They captured Timothy there, and his brother Chereas, and Apollonius. And after this they killed them, and wounded many with swords.

(2 Maccabees 12:13) 
Now the Passover was in the month of Xanti, and when it came, they celebrated it.

(2 Maccabees 12:14) 
After this, they went to a fortress that was under the mountains, named Garizim, and they killed many of those who were in it.

(2 Maccabees 12:15) 
And at this time, those who were in Bethsura, having been in the garrison, took refuge against them, and they prayed to the Lord.

(2 Maccabees 12:16) 
And they fought against them, and gave them their hand: and at this time, there were those who were reproached by the impious among them.

(2 Maccabees 12:17) 
And they celebrated the holy things with their garrisons, and there were those who were from Bethsura.

(2 Maccabees 12:18) 
For it was the day of celebrating the holy things, in the month of Xanti, and in the month before that, which we mentioned before.

(2 Maccabees 12:19) 
Now those who were in Jerusalem followed those who had been in Galilee, who in the same month of Xanti, were celebrating.

(2 Maccabees 12:20) 
And after rising up, they surrounded the camp of Judas, who had fought, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:21) 
And they came to Jerusalem, and supplicating, they prayed that they might be worthy, and with virtue, and to the end they would arrive.

(2 Maccabees 12:22) 
And after this, they went to the camp, and in it, were those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:23) 
And when they came near, crying out, and their gods, they implored that they would send for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:24) 
But Judas, and those with him, praying, asked for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:25) 
And when the prayer had been made, and they cried out, the impious were there, and there were some of the gentiles, who were in them, and were prepared for battle.

(2 Maccabees 12:26) 
And Judas and those with him fought, and were confused, and fled.

(2 Maccabees 12:27) 
And after this, some of them were wounded, and about thirty men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:28) 
And Judas, and those with him, followed and returned to their camp: and then, crying out and supplicating, they prayed.

(2 Maccabees 12:29) 
And they came to their camp, and after this, they fled, and were killed by those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:30) 
And on that day, there were those near the village, which is under the mountains, named Adasa: and there they were in prayer and cried out: and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:31) 
But Judas and those with him, after this, came: and with them, they cried out, and praying, and after this, they cried out.

(2 Maccabees 12:32) 
And they killed, and pierced, and on that day, about three hundred men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:33) 
And Judas, and those with him, returned and took the spoils.

(2 Maccabees 12:34) 
And after this, they were from Jericho, and in Jericho, and around, and after this, they were from Adasa.

(2 Maccabees 12:35) 
And they returned, and took the spoils. And after this, they were from Jerusalem, and after this, from them, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:36) 
And they gave to him, who was over them, from Jerusalem, and those who were from Jerusalem, and around, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:37) 
And when they came to the land of Judea, and from them, and in the land of Judea, and after this, they were from Bethsura, and in Bethsura, and around, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:38) 
And they came, and after this, they were from Jerusalem, and from them, and in Jerusalem, and to the temple, and in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 12:39) 
And in those days, and then, they prayed to the Lord, and after this, they prayed for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:40) 
And after this, the Jews, and those with him, and after this, they prayed, and asked for them, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:41) 
And then, they were in Jerusalem, and praying, and after this, they were in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 12:42) 
And when they arrived, they gave them money, and sacrificing, and after this, they sacrificed.

(2 Maccabees 12:43) 
And when they had finished, and they gave all, and after this, they gave money, and then, they were and sacrificed, and gave and sacrificed, and took the spoils.

(2 Maccabees 12:44) 
And after this, when they had completed all things, and all things, and after this, they gave all, and sacrificed, and when they had come to the end, and in those days, and after this, and in them, they were, and then, and before, they were.

(2 Maccabees 12:45) 
And those in Jerusalem, with the Jews, and to the temple, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:46) 
And Judas and those with him, came to them, and after this, they prayed, and after this, they asked, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:47) 
And in those days, the feast of dedication, and in the feast days, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:48) 
And in them, and then, they praised and gave thanks to God, and praised, and in the feast days, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:49) 
And in them, and then, the Jews, who were there, and who were there, and after this, and in Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:50) 
And in those days, after this, and in Jerusalem, and praying, and for them, and after this, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 13:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-ninth year, Judas learned that Antiochus Eupator was coming with an army into Judea,

(2 Maccabees 13:2) 
and he brought with him a great force. With him was Alcimus, whom the king had made high priest.

(2 Maccabees 13:3) 
He had been disgraced in his own time because of his betrayal, and he began to strike the people and to kill those who were doing his work.

(2 Maccabees 13:4) 
All the wicked men gathered together and gathered wicked men to themselves, and they became strong, and they controlled the land, and they inflicted a severe plague upon Israel.

(2 Maccabees 13:5) 
And Judas, seeing that the evils had increased, and that the army was in the camps against them, and that the time was approaching for them to advance,

(2 Maccabees 13:6) 
commanded the rest of the people, saying: Do not be afraid of the face of the multitude, nor be terrified by the onslaught of the army.

(2 Maccabees 13:7) 
Remember the great salvation that was made for our fathers in the sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with his army.

(2 Maccabees 13:8) 
And now, if we cry out to the sky, God will have mercy on us and will remember His covenant, and He will crush this army before our faces today.

(2 Maccabees 13:9) 
So they terrified them, and they charged, and the adversaries were thrown into confusion.

(2 Maccabees 13:10) 
And they struck down of them on that day about five thousand men, and the horsemen and foot soldiers were wounded.

(2 Maccabees 13:11) 
And seeing that they had begun to resist, and had become bold, they boldly engaged against them.

(2 Maccabees 13:12) 
And they were confused, and many wounded fell from the rest; others fled into the camp.

(2 Maccabees 13:13) 
And in the camp was Nicanor, who had come from Judea and had been sent by the king.

(2 Maccabees 13:14) 
Hearing that the men of the Jews were stronger, he was terrified and no longer dared to strike.

(2 Maccabees 13:15) 
And on the Sabbath day, Judas went out with his men, and the war flared up.

(2 Maccabees 13:16) 
And they said among themselves, “What shall we do, since these Jews do not cease, but go to fight?”

(2 Maccabees 13:17) 
Then Nicanor commanded on the Sabbath day that they should lay down their arms and go out.

(2 Maccabees 13:18) 
And they went around to the Jews and fought against them, and about three hundred men fell from them on that day.

(2 Maccabees 13:19) 
Judas and his men went to bury the dead, and they began to place them with their fathers.

(2 Maccabees 13:20) 
And they found under the tunics of the slain men the vessels of the idols of Jamnia, which the Jews were forbidden to use according to the law.

(2 Maccabees 13:21) 
And it became clear to everyone that they had fallen for this reason.

(2 Maccabees 13:22) 
Therefore, all blessed the Lord, the just judge, who reveals hidden things.

(2 Maccabees 13:23) 
And Judas, turning back, exhorted the people to guard themselves from sins, because they had seen with their own eyes what had happened on account of the sin of those who had been killed.

(2 Maccabees 13:24) 
Then, gathering them individually, he sent twelve men to Rome to make friendship with them, and to receive help from them.

(2 Maccabees 13:25) 
And he read in them letters, in which they were commanded to receive the Jewish people into friendship and to give them aid if there was any need.

(2 Maccabees 13:26) 
Then the Macedonians went out to war, and Judas and his men besieged Casphin, and they fought.

(2 Maccabees 13:27) 
And those in the camp fled within the walls, and the Jews captured the city.

(2 Maccabees 13:28) 
And when day came, Judas gathered two thousand men from them, and divided them into two divisions for battle.

(2 Maccabees 13:29) 
And they engaged in battle, and they killed about eight thousand of them, and all the rest fled into the land of Galathi.

(2 Maccabees 13:30) 
On that day, Timothy, who was over the camps, was captured by them and was greatly tormented.

(2 Maccabees 13:31) 
And his brothers gathered around him, and they beseeched him and let him go, for they were afraid.

(2 Maccabees 14:1) 
In the one hundred forty-ninth year of the Seleucid era, Demetrius learned that the Romans and those in Asia were fearful of the Jews and were alarmed by them.

(2 Maccabees 14:2) 
So he gathered his wicked men and went out on a military campaign.

(2 Maccabees 14:3) 
He came to the land of Judea and marched toward the city of Jerusalem. He then fought against a large army.

(2 Maccabees 14:4) 
And Macabeus (Judas Maccabaeus) set up camp against him and against his army. Seeing his army coming, he prayed to the Lord and said:

(2 Maccabees 14:5) 
“O Lord, you have always gone before our fathers in battle, throwing down their enemies and giving them into our hands.

(2 Maccabees 14:6) 
Give our army the strength to fight and send a good angel before us to encourage us.

(2 Maccabees 14:7) 
May they be struck with fear and terror by the power of your arm, and let those who blaspheme your holy name perish.”

(2 Maccabees 14:8) 
The battle began, and many soldiers of Demetrius fell and were routed. Judas pursued them from the camp as far as Gaza and the surrounding territories.

(2 Maccabees 14:9) 
The battle brought great defeat on that day.

(2 Maccabees 14:10) 
Now, Jason, who had transported the Jews to his own city, and who had treated them badly and unjustly, betrayed his own people.

(2 Maccabees 14:11) 
Those who were persecuting the Jews along all the roads, and the citizens as well, killed them all and seized their silver and gold.

(2 Maccabees 14:12) 
They took the silver to the city and the rest to Jerusalem. Jason fled from Jerusalem to the city.

(2 Maccabees 14:13) 
The one who was defeated fled to the city of the Arabs and was routed and driven out by Aretas, the prince of the Arabs.

(2 Maccabees 14:14) 
Jason was pursued into the city, where he behaved wickedly, and was driven out into exile.

(2 Maccabees 14:15) 
Then, about three hundred Jews who had gone on the road to the city were captured and handed over to their enemies.

(2 Maccabees 14:16) 
Meanwhile, Menelaus became so wicked and was a most cruel tyrant. He gave orders for the killing of his own citizens.

(2 Maccabees 14:17) 
He entered Jerusalem with the wicked Antiochus, committing all of his evil deeds.

(2 Maccabees 14:18) 
He fell upon the city as if he were an enemy. He came with a scheme to do wrong and acted unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:19) 
He struck down many of the people and seized great spoils.

(2 Maccabees 14:20) 
Hearing this, Judas, who was fighting against Demetrius with his army, returned to the land of Judea and immediately went out to Berse and fought against Menelaus.

(2 Maccabees 14:21) 
He hid himself in Jerusalem and near the walls.

(2 Maccabees 14:22) 
While Judas was pressing the battle, the king sent soldiers to him.

(2 Maccabees 14:23) 
Menelaus was struck down and fell in battle, and Judas defeated him.

(2 Maccabees 14:24) 
When Judas went to the king, he pointed out the wickedness of those in the city.

(2 Maccabees 14:25) 
But when the king judged him, he ordered him to go to his death.

(2 Maccabees 14:26) 
For he had committed wickedness in the city, inflicting tortures and all kinds of crimes. Therefore, he was punished.

(2 Maccabees 14:27) 
And a crowd gathered around him and on his side, and they stoned him in the place where he had done wrong.

(2 Maccabees 14:28) 
Of those who were with Menelaus, many perished. He was now alone in Jerusalem, acting unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:29) 
When Jason came to trial and was sent to the Lacedaemonians, he was found guilty of acting unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:30) 
And those who sent him were punished, since he betrayed both himself and the one whom he had sent.

(2 Maccabees 14:31) 
When the king heard this, he was angry and punished them. Because they were from the city, he judged them and killed them.

(2 Maccabees 14:32) 
He killed many of the citizens and gave others to the soldiers to plunder. He cast out Jason, the wicked man, and the one who acted unjustly towards all, and he drove them into exile.

(2 Maccabees 14:33) 
He returned to Arabia and died in exile, and there was no one to bury him.

(2 Maccabees 14:34) 
And all those who acted against the law, against the holy things, and committed iniquities did not escape punishment.

(2 Maccabees 14:35) 
For even Demetrius, while fighting with his army, surrounded them. He was defeated by Macabeus and those with him and fled into the city.

(2 Maccabees 15:1) 
After this happened, Judas and his brothers were told that Antiochus Eupator had arrived in Judea with a large army,

(2 Maccabees 15:2) 
and with him was Lysias, his regent, commanding the most powerful part of the army: 110,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, 22 elephants, and 300 scythed chariots.

(2 Maccabees 15:3) 
Some Jews also came to him, requesting peace and hoping to avoid danger, and Lysias urged them forward.

(2 Maccabees 15:4) 
But he, acting with bad intentions and cruel desire, was invading Judea and the brothers who were mentioned previously.

(2 Maccabees 15:5) 
As he was approaching Jerusalem, a horseman, armed with golden armor, appeared in a vision from the sky, riding in front of him.

(2 Maccabees 15:6) 
Showing the mounted troop to Lysias, the horseman said, "Judas and his brothers were walking in this way, without fear."

(2 Maccabees 15:7) 
When Lysias saw this, they all fell from their horses, terrified, and were scattered.

(2 Maccabees 15:8) 
The Jews, however, were giving thanks to God, rejoicing in what He had done for them. Those who had been sent from the sky to them, were equipped with weapons, ready to fight.

(2 Maccabees 15:9) 
When they were close, they fought fiercely, and the enemies were wounded and scattered, and the rest fled.

(2 Maccabees 15:10) 
As Judas and his brothers were gaining glory and strength, he said, "Do not fight against your enemies, but remain in your place and worship the Lord together."

(2 Maccabees 15:11) 
Then, singing hymns in their presence and giving thanks to the Lord, who had acted wonderfully for them, brave and strong men arose and fought the battle, wounding more than 5,000 of the enemy.

(2 Maccabees 15:12) 
Seeing his armies defeated and the strongest soldiers fleeing, Antiochus Eupator became afraid and, against his will, agreed to peace with the Jews.

(2 Maccabees 15:13) 
The Jews, after agreeing to peace, handed over the weapons to their citizens and returned the garrisons, provisions, and everything they had taken to the camp.

(2 Maccabees 15:14) 
Antiochus and Lysias, after receiving everything, returned to the king through Judea with praise.

(2 Maccabees 15:15) 
After this, as they were returning to King Antiochus, a certain Philip, who was one of the king's advisors and was troubled, said to the king, "We don't control the kingdom; it's being governed with a garrison and wealth."

(2 Maccabees 15:16) 
But also, the Jews who fled from Judea are disturbing us and are adopting their customs."

(2 Maccabees 15:17) 
Therefore, I say, it is necessary for us to depart and make peace with the Jews. Otherwise, they and those who have helped them will harm us."

(2 Maccabees 15:18) 
After saying these things, Antiochus immediately became enraged and ordered Philip to be seized and killed, and he died many days later.

(2 Maccabees 15:19) 
After a great sacrifice, the Jews, and his sons, gathered to the destruction of the temple, and for this cause, they all came together.

(2 Maccabees 15:20) 
The gathering was made so that they would be seen, and the Jews, in their place, fought for the law and their homeland.

(2 Maccabees 15:21) 
Philip and those with him withdrew and fought, coming to the aid of those who were with the Jews.

(2 Maccabees 15:22) 
Then Judas, gathered with the other Jews in the appointed place, fought.

(2 Maccabees 15:23) 
And he shouted in their hearing: "God is just and strong! God is just and strong!"

(2 Maccabees 15:24) 
And he set up a banner, upon which there was a golden sign. Everyone who came forward in strength and danger, perished.

(2 Maccabees 15:25) 
The enemies were thrown down, but Judas, the son of Matthias, especially, waged war with his men.

(2 Maccabees 15:26) 
When the Jews heard of Judas's fame and what he had done, fearing him, they remained in his hands, as they were.

(2 Maccabees 15:27) 
And they praised the Lord, who had given them victory.

(Matthew 1:1) 
This is the book of the ancestry of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, son of Abraham.

(Matthew 1:2) 
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers:

(Matthew 1:3) 
Judah was the father of Phares and Zaram. Their mother was Thamar. Phares was the father of Esrom. Esrom was the father of Aram:

(Matthew 1:4) 
Aram was the father of Aminadab. Aminadab was the father of Naasson. Naasson was the father of Salmon:

(Matthew 1:5) 
Salmon was the father of Booz, whose mother was Rahab. Booz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed was the father of Jesse:

(Matthew 1:6) 
Jesse was the father of King David. King David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah:

(Matthew 1:7) 
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa:

(Matthew 1:8) 
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah:

(Matthew 1:9) 
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah:

(Matthew 1:10) 
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amos. Amos was the father of Josiah:

(Matthew 1:11) 
Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.

(Matthew 1:12) 
After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel:

(Matthew 1:13) 
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor:

(Matthew 1:14) 
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achim. Achim was the father of Eliud:

(Matthew 1:15) 
Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob:

(Matthew 1:16) 
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ.

(Matthew 1:17) 
Thus there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Christ.

(Matthew 1:18) 
This is how Jesus Christ was born. His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they were married, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.

(Matthew 1:19) 
Because Joseph was a righteous man and did not want to publicly disgrace her, he decided to quietly divorce her.

(Matthew 1:20) 
But as he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

(Matthew 1:21) 
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

(Matthew 1:22) 
All of this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:

(Matthew 1:23) 
“Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,” which means, “God with us.”

(Matthew 1:24) 
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.

(Matthew 1:25) 
But he did not know her as a husband until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.

(Matthew 2:1) 
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,

(Matthew 2:2) 
saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”

(Matthew 2:3) 
King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

(Matthew 2:4) 
He assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

(Matthew 2:5) 
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea.” For so it is written by the prophet:

(Matthew 2:6) 
“And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”

(Matthew 2:7) 
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the time when the star had appeared.

(Matthew 2:8) 
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”

(Matthew 2:9) 
When they had heard the king, they went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was.

(Matthew 2:10) 
When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.

(Matthew 2:11) 
And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

(Matthew 2:12) 
And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

(Matthew 2:13) 
Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him.”

(Matthew 2:14) 
So he got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt,

(Matthew 2:15) 
and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”

(Matthew 2:16) 
Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.

(Matthew 2:17) 
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

(Matthew 2:18) 
“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”

(Matthew 2:19) 
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

(Matthew 2:20) 
saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”

(Matthew 2:21) 
So he got up, took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

(Matthew 2:22) 
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,

(Matthew 2:23) 
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.

(Matthew 3:1) 
At that time, John the Baptist came, preaching in the desert of Judea,

(Matthew 3:2) 
and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"

(Matthew 3:3) 
For this is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the desert, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.'

(Matthew 3:4) 
Now John himself wore a garment made of camel's hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.

(Matthew 3:5) 
Then Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan River went out to him,

(Matthew 3:6) 
and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

(Matthew 3:7) 
But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

(Matthew 3:8) 
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.

(Matthew 3:9) 
And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.

(Matthew 3:10) 
And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Matthew 3:11) 
I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

(Matthew 3:12) 
His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."

(Matthew 3:13) 
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.

(Matthew 3:14) 
But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?"

(Matthew 3:15) 
But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him.

(Matthew 3:16) 
When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.

(Matthew 3:17) 
And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

(Matthew 4:1) 
Then the Holy Spirit sent Jesus to the desert to be tested by the devil.

(Matthew 4:2) 
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, He became hungry.

(Matthew 4:3) 
The tempter then came to Him, and said, "If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."

(Matthew 4:4) 
But Jesus responded: "The Scriptures say, 'Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

(Matthew 4:5) 
Then the devil took Him to the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,

(Matthew 4:6) 
saying, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down, because it is written, 'He will command His angels concerning you.' And 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.'

(Matthew 4:7) 
Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'

(Matthew 4:8) 
Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,

(Matthew 4:9) 
and said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You fall down and worship me."

(Matthew 4:10) 
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.'

(Matthew 4:11) 
Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.

(Matthew 4:12) 
But when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee.

(Matthew 4:13) 
And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,

(Matthew 4:14) 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying:

(Matthew 4:15) 
'The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

(Matthew 4:16) 
the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned.'

(Matthew 4:17) 
From that time, Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

(Matthew 4:18) 
And walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

(Matthew 4:19) 
And He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."

(Matthew 4:20) 
And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

(Matthew 4:21) 
And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.

(Matthew 4:22) 
And immediately they left the nets and their father, and followed Him.

(Matthew 4:23) 
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.

(Matthew 4:24) 
Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.

(Matthew 4:25) 
And great multitudes followed Him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

(Matthew 5:1) 
Seeing the crowds, He went up onto the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples gathered around Him.

(Matthew 5:2) 
Opening His mouth, He taught them, saying:

(Matthew 5:3) 
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:4) 
Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the earth.

(Matthew 5:5) 
Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted.

(Matthew 5:6) 
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall have their fill.

(Matthew 5:7) 
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

(Matthew 5:8) 
Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God.

(Matthew 5:9) 
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

(Matthew 5:10) 
Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice's sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:11) 
Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for My sake:

(Matthew 5:12) 
Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

(Matthew 5:13) 
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is good for nothing anymore but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.

(Matthew 5:14) 
You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.

(Matthew 5:15) 
Neither do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but upon a lampstand, that it may shine to all who are in the house.

(Matthew 5:16) 
So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 5:17) 
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.

(Matthew 5:18) 
For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law, till all things are accomplished.

(Matthew 5:19) 
Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he that shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:20) 
For I say unto you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:21) 
You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

(Matthew 5:22) 
But I say to you, that whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

(Matthew 5:23) 
If therefore you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you:

(Matthew 5:24) 
leave your gift before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to your brother; and then coming you shall offer your gift.

(Matthew 5:25) 
Be at agreement with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.

(Matthew 5:26) 
Amen I say to you, you shall not go out from thence, till you repay the last farthing.

(Matthew 5:27) 
You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery.

(Matthew 5:28) 
But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

(Matthew 5:29) 
And if thy right eye scandalizes thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

(Matthew 5:30) 
And if thy right hand scandalizes thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body should go into hell.

(Matthew 5:31) 
And it hath been said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.

(Matthew 5:32) 
But I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her who is put away, commits adultery.

(Matthew 5:33) 
Again you have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not forswear thyself; but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.

(Matthew 5:34) 
But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God:

(Matthew 5:35) 
nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet: nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king:

(Matthew 5:36) 
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.

(Matthew 5:37) 
But let your speech be, Yes, yes: No, no: and that which is over and above these, is of evil.

(Matthew 5:38) 
You have heard that it hath been said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

(Matthew 5:39) 
But I say to you not to resist evil: but if anyone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other:

(Matthew 5:40) 
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also:

(Matthew 5:41) 
And whosoever shall force thee to go one mile, go with him two.

(Matthew 5:42) 
Give to him that asks of thee; and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.

(Matthew 5:43) 
You have heard that it hath been said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy.

(Matthew 5:44) 
But I say to you, Love your enemies: do good to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:

(Matthew 5:45) 
That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: who makes his sun to rise upon the good and the bad, and rains upon the just and the unjust.

(Matthew 5:46) 
For if you love those who love you, what reward shall you have? Do not even the publicans do the same?

(Matthew 5:47) 
And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? Do not also the heathens do the same?

(Matthew 5:48) 
Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.

(Matthew 6:1) 
Be careful not to display your piety merely to be seen by others. Otherwise, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.

(Matthew 6:2) 
So when you give alms, do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:3) 
But when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

(Matthew 6:4) 
so that your alms may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:5) 
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:6) 
But when you pray, go into your room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:7) 
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

(Matthew 6:8) 
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

(Matthew 6:9) 
Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

(Matthew 6:10) 
“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

(Matthew 6:11) 
“Give us this day our daily bread,

(Matthew 6:12) 
“And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

(Matthew 6:13) 
“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”

(Matthew 6:14) 
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,

(Matthew 6:15) 
but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

(Matthew 6:16) 
“And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:17) 
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,

(Matthew 6:18) 
that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father, who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:19) 
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,

(Matthew 6:20) 
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

(Matthew 6:21) 
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

(Matthew 6:22) 
“The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,

(Matthew 6:23) 
but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

(Matthew 6:24) 
“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

(Matthew 6:25) 
“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

(Matthew 6:26) 
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?

(Matthew 6:27) 
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?

(Matthew 6:28) 
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,

(Matthew 6:29) 
yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

(Matthew 6:30) 
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

(Matthew 6:31) 
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

(Matthew 6:32) 
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.

(Matthew 6:33) 
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

(Matthew 6:34) 
“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

(Matthew 7:1) 
Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.

(Matthew 7:2) 
Because in the way you judge, you will be judged. And in the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

(Matthew 7:3) 
And why do you see a splinter in your brother's eye, but the beam in your own eye do you not see?

(Matthew 7:4) 
Or how do you say to your brother, ‘Let me cast the splinter out of your eye,’ and look, there is a beam in your own eye?

(Matthew 7:5) 
Hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see how to cast the splinter out of your brother's eye.

(Matthew 7:6) 
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest perhaps they trample them with their feet, and turning, they tear you to pieces.

(Matthew 7:7) 
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

(Matthew 7:8) 
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened.

(Matthew 7:9) 
Or what man is there among you, whom if his son asks for bread, will he hand him a stone?

(Matthew 7:10) 
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?

(Matthew 7:11) 
If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?

(Matthew 7:12) 
Therefore, all things that you want men to do to you, do also to them. For this is the Law and the Prophets.

(Matthew 7:13) 
Enter through the narrow gate; because wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.

(Matthew 7:14) 
How narrow is the gate, and constricted is the way that leads to life; and few are those who find it!

(Matthew 7:15) 
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.

(Matthew 7:16) 
By their fruits you will know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?

(Matthew 7:17) 
So every good tree brings forth good fruits, and a bad tree brings forth bad fruits.

(Matthew 7:18) 
A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruits, nor can a bad tree bring forth good fruits.

(Matthew 7:19) 
Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Matthew 7:20) 
Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.

(Matthew 7:21) 
Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 7:22) 
Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’

(Matthew 7:23) 
And then I will confess to them: ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you who work iniquity.’

(Matthew 7:24) 
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock.

(Matthew 7:25) 
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not fall, because it was founded upon a rock.

(Matthew 7:26) 
And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.

(Matthew 7:27) 
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was its ruin.

(Matthew 7:28) 
And it happened that when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.

(Matthew 7:29) 
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.

(Matthew 8:1) 
When Jesus came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.

(Matthew 8:2) 
And behold, a leper came and worshipped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”

(Matthew 8:3) 
And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.”

(Matthew 8:4) 
And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”

(Matthew 8:5) 
When He had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, beseeching Him,

(Matthew 8:6) 
and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”

(Matthew 8:7) 
And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

(Matthew 8:8) 
The centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.

(Matthew 8:9) 
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

(Matthew 8:10) 
When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed Him, “Truly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith in anyone in Israel.

(Matthew 8:11) 
I say to you that many will come from the east and west and recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,

(Matthew 8:12) 
but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

(Matthew 8:13) 
And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed that very hour.

(Matthew 8:14) 
When Jesus had entered Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.

(Matthew 8:15) 
He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and served Him.

(Matthew 8:16) 
When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.

(Matthew 8:17) 
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.”

(Matthew 8:18) 
Now when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to go over to the other side.

(Matthew 8:19) 
And a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”

(Matthew 8:20) 
And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”

(Matthew 8:21) 
And another of the disciples said to Him, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”

(Matthew 8:22) 
But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

(Matthew 8:23) 
And when He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.

(Matthew 8:24) 
And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with waves, but He was sleeping.

(Matthew 8:25) 
And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”

(Matthew 8:26) 
And He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.

(Matthew 8:27) 
And the men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”

(Matthew 8:28) 
And when He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him as they came out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.

(Matthew 8:29) 
And they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”

(Matthew 8:30) 
Now some distance from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.

(Matthew 8:31) 
And the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.”

(Matthew 8:32) 
And He said to them, “Go!” And when they came out, they went into the swine, and behold, the whole herd of swine rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.

(Matthew 8:33) 
Then the herdsmen fled, and they went away to the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.

(Matthew 8:34) 
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.

(Matthew 9:1) 
Then, Jesus got into a boat and crossed the sea to return to his own city.

(Matthew 9:2) 
And as he arrived, some people brought to him a paralytic, who was lying on a bed.

(Matthew 9:3) 
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Have courage, my son; your sins are forgiven.”

(Matthew 9:4) 
Some of the scribes, however, thought to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.”

(Matthew 9:5) 
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you consider evil things in your hearts?

(Matthew 9:6) 
Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?

(Matthew 9:7) 
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—then Jesus said to the paralytic, “Rise, take your bed, and go home.”

(Matthew 9:8) 
And immediately he rose and went home.

(Matthew 9:9) 
Seeing this, the crowds were struck with fear and glorified God, who had given such power to men.

(Matthew 9:10) 
As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me.” And Matthew rose and followed him.

(Matthew 9:11) 
While Jesus was at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.

(Matthew 9:12) 
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

(Matthew 9:13) 
But when Jesus heard this, he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor, but those who are sick.

(Matthew 9:14) 
But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

(Matthew 9:15) 
Then John's disciples came to him, asking, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”

(Matthew 9:16) 
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away, and then they will fast.

(Matthew 9:17) 
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse.

(Matthew 9:18) 
Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, the wine spills out, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”

(Matthew 9:19) 
While he was saying these things to them, a certain ruler came and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come, put your hand on her, and she will live.”

(Matthew 9:20) 
Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.

(Matthew 9:21) 
Suddenly, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his garment.

(Matthew 9:22) 
For she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.”

(Matthew 9:23) 
Jesus turned, and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter; your faith has saved you.” And from that moment, the woman was made well.

(Matthew 9:24) 
When Jesus arrived at the ruler’s house, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion.

(Matthew 9:25) 
He said, “Get out! The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they laughed at him.

(Matthew 9:26) 
But when the crowd was put out, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

(Matthew 9:27) 
And the news of this spread throughout that whole region.

(Matthew 9:28) 
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”

(Matthew 9:29) 
When he entered the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?”

(Matthew 9:30) 
They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith, let it be done for you.”

(Matthew 9:31) 
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.”

(Matthew 9:32) 
But they went out and spread the news of him throughout that whole region.

(Matthew 9:33) 
After they went out, behold, they brought to him a mute man possessed by a demon.

(Matthew 9:34) 
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”

(Matthew 9:35) 
But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of demons he casts out demons.”

(Matthew 9:36) 
Jesus traveled throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.

(Matthew 9:37) 
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

(Matthew 9:38) 
Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.

(Matthew 9:39) 
Therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”

(Matthew 10:1) 
And when He had called His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every sickness and every disease.

(Matthew 10:2) 
And these are the names of the twelve Apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,

(Matthew 10:3) 
Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,

(Matthew 10:4) 
Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

(Matthew 10:5) 
These twelve Jesus sent, commanding them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.

(Matthew 10:6) 
But go instead to the sheep that have gone astray from the house of Israel.

(Matthew 10:7) 
And as you go, preach, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’

(Matthew 10:8) 
Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: you have received freely, give freely.

(Matthew 10:9) 
Do not acquire gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses:

(Matthew 10:10) 
Nor a bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.

(Matthew 10:11) 
And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy: and stay there until you leave.

(Matthew 10:12) 
And entering into the house, greet it, saying: ‘Peace to this house.’

(Matthew 10:13) 
And if the house is worthy, your peace will come upon it: but if it is not worthy, your peace will return to you.

(Matthew 10:14) 
And whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words: leaving that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

(Matthew 10:15) 
Amen I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

(Matthew 10:16) 
Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be prudent as serpents, and simple as doves.

(Matthew 10:17) 
But beware of men. For they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you:

(Matthew 10:18) 
And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

(Matthew 10:19) 
But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak: for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say:

(Matthew 10:20) 
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

(Matthew 10:21) 
And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death:

(Matthew 10:22) 
And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake: but he who perseveres until the end, he will be saved.

(Matthew 10:23) 
And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.

(Matthew 10:24) 
The disciple is not above his master, nor is the servant above his lord.

(Matthew 10:25) 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?

(Matthew 10:26) 
Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed: and nothing secret that will not be known.

(Matthew 10:27) 
What I say to you in the dark, speak in the light: and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops.

(Matthew 10:28) 
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul: but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

(Matthew 10:29) 
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And not one of them will fall on the ground without your Father.

(Matthew 10:30) 
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

(Matthew 10:31) 
Therefore do not be afraid: you are more valuable than many sparrows.

(Matthew 10:32) 
Therefore everyone who acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 10:33) 
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 10:34) 
Do not think that I came to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

(Matthew 10:35) 
For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:

(Matthew 10:36) 
And a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.

(Matthew 10:37) 
He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

(Matthew 10:38) 
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.

(Matthew 10:39) 
He who finds his life will lose it: and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.

(Matthew 10:40) 
He who receives you receives Me: and he who receives Me receives Him Who sent Me.

(Matthew 10:41) 
He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward: and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.

(Matthew 10:42) 
And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple: Amen I say to you, he will not lose his reward.

(Matthew 11:1) 
After Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.

(Matthew 11:2) 
When John heard in prison about the things that Christ was doing, he sent two of his disciples,

(Matthew 11:3) 
asking Him, "Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for another?"

(Matthew 11:4) 
Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:

(Matthew 11:5) 
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are evangelized."

(Matthew 11:6) 
Blessed is the one who is not offended by Me."

(Matthew 11:7) 
As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

(Matthew 11:8) 
Or what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are in royal palaces.

(Matthew 11:9) 
Or what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

(Matthew 11:10) 
This is the one about whom it is written: ‘I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way before You.’

(Matthew 11:11) 
Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

(Matthew 11:12) 
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people are taking it by force.

(Matthew 11:13) 
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

(Matthew 11:14) 
And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.

(Matthew 11:15) 
He who has ears, let him hear.

(Matthew 11:16) 
To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions:

(Matthew 11:17) 
‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.’

(Matthew 11:18) 
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’

(Matthew 11:19) 
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved right by her deeds."

(Matthew 11:20) 
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent:

(Matthew 11:21) 
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

(Matthew 11:22) 
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.

(Matthew 11:23) 
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.

(Matthew 11:24) 
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."

(Matthew 11:25) 
At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of the universe and the earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and revealed them to little children.

(Matthew 11:26) 
Yes, Father, for this is what You were pleased to do.

(Matthew 11:27) 
All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him.

(Matthew 11:28) 
"Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

(Matthew 11:29) 
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

(Matthew 11:30) 
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."

(Matthew 12:1) 
At that time, Jesus walked through a field of grain on a Sabbath. His disciples, famished, began to pluck the heads of grain and eat them.

(Matthew 12:2) 
But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what isn't lawful to do on the Sabbath."

(Matthew 12:3) 
But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:

(Matthew 12:4) 
How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?

(Matthew 12:5) 
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath, and are without guilt?

(Matthew 12:6) 
But I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.

(Matthew 12:7) 
If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would never have condemned the innocent.

(Matthew 12:8) 
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.

(Matthew 12:9) 
And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.

(Matthew 12:10) 
And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they questioned Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" This was to accuse Him.

(Matthew 12:11) 
But He said to them, "Who among you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?

(Matthew 12:12) 
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

(Matthew 12:13) 
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.

(Matthew 12:14) 
But the Pharisees went out and made a plan against Him, on how to destroy Him.

(Matthew 12:15) 
Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all.

(Matthew 12:16) 
And He commanded them not to make Him known.

(Matthew 12:17) 
This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:

(Matthew 12:18) 
"Behold, My servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.

(Matthew 12:19) 
He will not quarrel nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

(Matthew 12:20) 
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not quench, until He brings justice to victory.

(Matthew 12:21) 
And in His name the Gentiles will hope."

(Matthew 12:22) 
Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that the man spoke and saw.

(Matthew 12:23) 
And all the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "Could this be the Son of David?"

(Matthew 12:24) 
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."

(Matthew 12:25) 
But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

(Matthew 12:26) 
And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

(Matthew 12:27) 
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

(Matthew 12:28) 
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

(Matthew 12:29) 
Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.

(Matthew 12:30) 
He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

(Matthew 12:31) 
Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

(Matthew 12:32) 
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

(Matthew 12:33) 
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For the tree is known by its fruit.

(Matthew 12:34) 
You brood of vipers, how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

(Matthew 12:35) 
The good man brings good things out of his good treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil treasure.

(Matthew 12:36) 
I tell you, that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account of it in the day of judgment.

(Matthew 12:37) 
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.

(Matthew 12:38) 
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."

(Matthew 12:39) 
He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

(Matthew 12:40) 
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.

(Matthew 12:41) 
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.

(Matthew 12:42) 
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.

(Matthew 12:43) 
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, it passes through arid places, seeking rest, but finds none.

(Matthew 12:44) 
Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

(Matthew 12:45) 
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.

(Matthew 12:46) 
While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him.

(Matthew 12:47) 
Then someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You."

(Matthew 12:48) 
But He answered the one who told Him, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?"

(Matthew 12:49) 
And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold My mother and My brothers!

(Matthew 12:50) 
For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven is My brother and sister and mother."

(Matthew 13:1) 
On that very day, Jesus went outside of the house and sat near the Sea of Galilee.

(Matthew 13:2) 
And many crowds came together to meet Him. He got into a boat and sat, and the entire crowd stood on the shore.

(Matthew 13:3) 
And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow seeds."

(Matthew 13:4) 
And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them.

(Matthew 13:5) 
Other seeds fell on rocky places where there wasn't much soil. They quickly sprang up because they didn't have much depth of soil.

(Matthew 13:6) 
But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they didn't have any roots, they withered.

(Matthew 13:7) 
Other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.

(Matthew 13:8) 
But others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.

(Matthew 13:9) 
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

(Matthew 13:10) 
And the disciples, approaching Him, said to Him: "Why do You speak to them in parables?"

(Matthew 13:11) 
He answered and said to them: "Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but it has not been given to them.

(Matthew 13:12) 
For to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance. But from him who does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away.

(Matthew 13:13) 
Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

(Matthew 13:14) 
And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in them, saying: 'You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. And seeing, you will see, but you will not perceive.'

(Matthew 13:15) 
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'

(Matthew 13:16) 
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.

(Matthew 13:17) 
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.

(Matthew 13:18) 
Therefore, hear the parable of the sower.

(Matthew 13:19) 
Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the road.

(Matthew 13:20) 
And the one sown on the rocky places, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.

(Matthew 13:21) 
Yet he has no root in himself, but is temporary. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he immediately falls away.

(Matthew 13:22) 
The one sown among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word. But the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

(Matthew 13:23) 
But the one sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, and he yields fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.

(Matthew 13:24) 
Another parable He put before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

(Matthew 13:25) 
But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.

(Matthew 13:26) 
When the blade came up and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.

(Matthew 13:27) 
And the servants of the master of the house came to him and said, 'Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'

(Matthew 13:28) 
He said to them: 'An enemy has done this.' And the servants said to him: 'Do you want us to go and gather them?'

(Matthew 13:29) 
He said: 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat with them.'

(Matthew 13:30) 
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: 'First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'

(Matthew 13:31) 
He put another parable before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.

(Matthew 13:32) 
It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown, it is the largest of the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and make nests in its branches.

(Matthew 13:33) 
He spoke another parable to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened."

(Matthew 13:34) 
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without parables,

(Matthew 13:35) 
so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.'

(Matthew 13:36) 
Then, having dismissed the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying: "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."

(Matthew 13:37) 
He answered and said to them: "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.

(Matthew 13:38) 
The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom, and the weeds are the children of the evil one.

(Matthew 13:39) 
And the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.

(Matthew 13:40) 
So just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.

(Matthew 13:41) 
The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that cause sin and those who do evil,

(Matthew 13:42) 
and will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 13:43) 
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has an ear, let him hear.

(Matthew 13:44) 
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. And for joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

(Matthew 13:45) 
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls,

(Matthew 13:46) 
and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.

(Matthew 13:47) 
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, from which fish of every kind were gathered.

(Matthew 13:48) 
When it was full, they drew it up on the shore, and they sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but threw away the bad ones.

(Matthew 13:49) 
So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous,

(Matthew 13:50) 
and will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 13:51) 
Have you understood all these things?" They said to Him, "Yes."

(Matthew 13:52) 
And He said to them: "Therefore, every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings out of his treasure things new and old."

(Matthew 13:53) 
And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.

(Matthew 13:54) 
And coming into his hometown, He taught them in their synagogues, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?

(Matthew 13:55) 
Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?

(Matthew 13:56) 
And are not His sisters all with us?" Where did this man get all these things?"

(Matthew 13:57) 
And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."

(Matthew 13:58) 
And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

(Matthew 14:1) 
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,

(Matthew 14:2) 
and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous works are happening through him.”

(Matthew 14:3) 
For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

(Matthew 14:4) 
John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”

(Matthew 14:5) 
And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because they considered John a prophet.

(Matthew 14:6) 
When Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and she pleased Herod.

(Matthew 14:7) 
So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.

(Matthew 14:8) 
Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”

(Matthew 14:9) 
The king was distressed, but because of his oath and his guests, he commanded it to be given.

(Matthew 14:10) 
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.

(Matthew 14:11) 
His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.

(Matthew 14:12) 
John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it, and then they went and told Jesus.

(Matthew 14:13) 
When Jesus heard this, He withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the towns.

(Matthew 14:14) 
As He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them and healed their sick.

(Matthew 14:15) 
When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”

(Matthew 14:16) 
But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”

(Matthew 14:17) 
They replied, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”

(Matthew 14:18) 
And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”

(Matthew 14:19) 
Then He commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the universe, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

(Matthew 14:20) 
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve full baskets of the fragments.

(Matthew 14:21) 
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

(Matthew 14:22) 
Immediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.

(Matthew 14:23) 
And after He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.

(Matthew 14:24) 
But the boat was already a long way from the land, battered by the waves, for the wind was against them.

(Matthew 14:25) 
And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.

(Matthew 14:26) 
And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.

(Matthew 14:27) 
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take courage; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

(Matthew 14:28) 
Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”

(Matthew 14:29) 
He said, “Come.” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

(Matthew 14:30) 
But when he saw the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”

(Matthew 14:31) 
Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

(Matthew 14:32) 
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

(Matthew 14:33) 
And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”

(Matthew 14:34) 
When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.

(Matthew 14:35) 
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that region and brought to Him all the sick.

(Matthew 14:36) 
And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched it were healed.

(Matthew 15:1) 
At that time, the scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and they were saying:

(Matthew 15:2) 
“Why do your disciples break the tradition of our elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat bread.”

(Matthew 15:3) 
Jesus then answered them, and said: “And why do you yourselves break God’s command because of your tradition?

(Matthew 15:4) 
For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever curses father or mother, let him die.’”

(Matthew 15:5) 
“But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever gift I have from you will benefit you,”

(Matthew 15:6) 
and does not honor his father or his mother,’ you have made void the command of God because of your tradition.

(Matthew 15:7) 
Hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied rightly about you, when he said:

(Matthew 15:8) 
‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

(Matthew 15:9) 
And in vain they worship me, teaching doctrines and commands of men.’

(Matthew 15:10) 
And calling the crowds to him, he said to them: “Hear and understand.

(Matthew 15:11) 
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a man.”

(Matthew 15:12) 
Then, approaching him, his disciples said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”

(Matthew 15:13) 
But he answered them, and said: “Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

(Matthew 15:14) 
Leave them be: they are blind, and are leaders of the blind. But if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”

(Matthew 15:15) 
And Peter answered, and said to him: “Explain to us this parable.”

(Matthew 15:16) 
But Jesus said: “Are you also still without understanding?

(Matthew 15:17) 
Do you not understand that everything that enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is eliminated in the privy?

(Matthew 15:18) 
But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and these defile a man.

(Matthew 15:19) 
For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.

(Matthew 15:20) 
These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”

(Matthew 15:21) 
And Jesus, going out from there, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

(Matthew 15:22) 
And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and was crying out, saying to him: “Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David! My daughter is severely vexed by a demon.”

(Matthew 15:23) 
But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples, approaching him, were begging him, saying: “Send her away, because she cries out after us.”

(Matthew 15:24) 
He answered, and said: “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

(Matthew 15:25) 
But she came and worshiped him, saying: “Lord, help me.”

(Matthew 15:26) 
He answered, and said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.”

(Matthew 15:27) 
But she said: “Yes, Lord; for even the puppies eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

(Matthew 15:28) 
Then Jesus answered, and said to her: “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.

(Matthew 15:29) 
And Jesus, having passed on from there, came near the sea of Galilee, and going up into a mountain, was sitting there.

(Matthew 15:30) 
And many crowds came to him, bringing with them the mute, the blind, the lame, the infirm, and many others. And they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them.

(Matthew 15:31) 
So that the crowds were astonished, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.

(Matthew 15:32) 
Then Jesus, calling his disciples, said: “I have compassion on the crowds, because they have been with me now for three days, and they have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”

(Matthew 15:33) 
And his disciples said to him: “Where do we get so many loaves in the wilderness so that we can satisfy such a large crowd?”

(Matthew 15:34) 
And Jesus said to them: “How many loaves do you have?” And they said: “Seven, and a few small fishes.”

(Matthew 15:35) 
And he commanded the crowds to recline on the ground.

(Matthew 15:36) 
And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

(Matthew 15:37) 
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what remained, seven baskets full of fragments.

(Matthew 15:38) 
Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.

(Matthew 15:39) 
And having dismissed the crowds, he went into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.

(Matthew 16:1) 
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi, and He asked His disciples, “What do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”

(Matthew 16:2) 
And they said: “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”

(Matthew 16:3) 
Jesus said to them, “But you, who do you say that I am?”

(Matthew 16:4) 
Then Simon Peter answered, saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

(Matthew 16:5) 
Then Jesus answered, saying to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father Who is in the universe.

(Matthew 16:6) 
And I say to you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.

(Matthew 16:7) 
And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the sky. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in the sky. And whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in the sky.”

(Matthew 16:8) 
Then He commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.

(Matthew 16:9) 
From that time on, Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and scribes and chief priests, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.

(Matthew 16:10) 
And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to You!”

(Matthew 16:11) 
But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”

(Matthew 16:12) 
Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.

(Matthew 16:13) 
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.

(Matthew 16:14) 
For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

(Matthew 16:15) 
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each one according to his works.

(Matthew 16:16) 
Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”

(Matthew 17:1) 
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, and James, and his brother John, and led them up a high mountain, just the three of them.

(Matthew 17:2) 
And he was transfigured before their eyes. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as snow.

(Matthew 17:3) 
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.

(Matthew 17:4) 
Then Peter responded to Jesus and said: “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

(Matthew 17:5) 
As he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud, saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”

(Matthew 17:6) 
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.

(Matthew 17:7) 
But Jesus came and touched them, and said: “Get up, and do not be afraid.”

(Matthew 17:8) 
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.

(Matthew 17:9) 
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man rises from the dead.”

(Matthew 17:10) 
And his disciples asked him, saying: “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

(Matthew 17:11) 
And answering, he said to them: “Elijah will come, and he will restore all things.”

(Matthew 17:12) 
“But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”

(Matthew 17:13) 
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.

(Matthew 17:14) 
And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, kneeling before him.

(Matthew 17:15) 
He said: “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is epileptic and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.

(Matthew 17:16) 
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”

(Matthew 17:17) 
Then Jesus answered and said: “O faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.”

(Matthew 17:18) 
And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and the boy was cured from that hour.

(Matthew 17:19) 
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: “Why could we not cast it out?”

(Matthew 17:20) 
Jesus said to them: “Because of your lack of faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”

(Matthew 17:21) 
“But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.”

(Matthew 17:22) 
While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them: “The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the hands of men.

(Matthew 17:23) 
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.” And they were exceedingly sorrowful.

(Matthew 17:24) 
When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said: “Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?”

(Matthew 17:25) 
He said: “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or tribute? From their sons or from strangers?”

(Matthew 17:26) 
He said: “From strangers.” Jesus said to him: “Therefore, the sons are free.”

(Matthew 17:27) 
“However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a stater. Give that for me and for you.”

(Matthew 18:1) 
At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of the sky?”

(Matthew 18:2) 
Jesus then called a little child, and made him stand in their midst,

(Matthew 18:3) 
and said: “I assure you: unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of the sky.

(Matthew 18:4) 
Whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of the sky.

(Matthew 18:5) 
And whoever welcomes one such child in My name welcomes Me.

(Matthew 18:6) 
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.

(Matthew 18:7) 
Woe to the world because of scandals! For it is necessary that scandals come, but woe to the man by whom the scandal comes!

(Matthew 18:8) 
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

(Matthew 18:9) 
And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire.

(Matthew 18:10) 
See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in the sky always behold the face of My Father who is in the sky.

(Matthew 18:11) 
For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.

(Matthew 18:12) 
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?

(Matthew 18:13) 
And if he finds it, I assure you that he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

(Matthew 18:14) 
Therefore, it is not the will of your Father who is in the sky that one of these little ones should perish.

(Matthew 18:15) 
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

(Matthew 18:16) 
But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed.

(Matthew 18:17) 
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the Church. And if he refuses to listen even to the Church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

(Matthew 18:18) 
I assure you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in the sky, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in the sky.

(Matthew 18:19) 
Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by My Father who is in the sky.

(Matthew 18:20) 
For where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them.

(Matthew 18:21) 
Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”

(Matthew 18:22) 
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.

(Matthew 18:23) 
For this reason, the kingdom of the sky is compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.

(Matthew 18:24) 
When he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.

(Matthew 18:25) 
And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.

(Matthew 18:26) 
So the servant fell down and implored him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’

(Matthew 18:27) 
And out of pity for the servant, the master released him and forgave him the debt.

(Matthew 18:28) 
But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And seizing him, he choked him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’

(Matthew 18:29) 
So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’

(Matthew 18:30) 
But he was unwilling and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.

(Matthew 18:31) 
When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place.

(Matthew 18:32) 
Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.

(Matthew 18:33) 
Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’

(Matthew 18:34) 
And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt.

(Matthew 18:35) 
So also My heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.

(Matthew 19:1) 
After Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.

(Matthew 19:2) 
Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

(Matthew 19:3) 
The Pharisees came to Him and tried to test Him, asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”

(Matthew 19:4) 
He answered and said to them, “Haven’t you read that the One who made mankind in the beginning made them male and female?”

(Matthew 19:5) 
And He said, ‘For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’

(Matthew 19:6) 
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no man separate.”

(Matthew 19:7) 
They said to Him, “Then why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to dismiss her?”

(Matthew 19:8) 
He said to them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts, but it was not so from the beginning.

(Matthew 19:9) 
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”

(Matthew 19:10) 
His disciples said to Him, “If the case of a man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.”

(Matthew 19:11) 
But He said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but those to whom it has been given.

(Matthew 19:12) 
For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone who can receive this, receive it.”

(Matthew 19:13) 
Then children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them,

(Matthew 19:14) 
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”

(Matthew 19:15) 
And after He laid hands on them, He departed from there.

(Matthew 19:16) 
And behold, one came to Him and said, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life?”

(Matthew 19:17) 
But He said to him, “Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

(Matthew 19:18) 
He said to Him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,

(Matthew 19:19) 
honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Matthew 19:20) 
The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept. What am I still lacking?”

(Matthew 19:21) 
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.”

(Matthew 19:22) 
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.

(Matthew 19:23) 
And Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 19:24) 
Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

(Matthew 19:25) 
When His disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”

(Matthew 19:26) 
But Jesus looked at them and said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

(Matthew 19:27) 
Then Peter responded and said to Him, “Behold, we have forsaken everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?”

(Matthew 19:28) 
And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

(Matthew 19:29) 
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name’s sake will receive many times more, and will inherit eternal life.

(Matthew 19:30) 
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

(Matthew 20:1) 
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning looking to hire workers for his vineyard.

(Matthew 20:2) 
After he agreed to pay the workers a denarius for a day's work, he sent them to his vineyard.

(Matthew 20:3) 
He went out again at about the third hour of the day and found others standing idle in the marketplace,

(Matthew 20:4) 
and said to them, 'Go into my vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is fair.' And so they went.

(Matthew 20:5) 
He went out again at about the sixth and ninth hours of the day, and did the same.

(Matthew 20:6) 
And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found still others standing there, and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?'

(Matthew 20:7) 
They said to him, 'Because nobody hired us.' He said to them, 'Go into my vineyard too.'

(Matthew 20:8) 
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and going to the first.'

(Matthew 20:9) 
So when those hired at the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.

(Matthew 20:10) 
When the first ones came, they thought they would receive more, but they too received a denarius.

(Matthew 20:11) 
When they received it, they began to complain about the owner of the vineyard,

(Matthew 20:12) 
saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and yet you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.'

(Matthew 20:13) 
But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

(Matthew 20:14) 
Take what belongs to you and go. I want to give to this last one the same as I gave to you.

(Matthew 20:15) 
Am I not allowed to do what I want with my own things? Or are you envious because I am generous?'

(Matthew 20:16) 
In this way the last will be first, and the first will be last. Many are called, but few are chosen.

(Matthew 20:17) 
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside in private and said to them,

(Matthew 20:18) 
“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,

(Matthew 20:19) 
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and on the third day he will be raised.”

(Matthew 20:20) 
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.

(Matthew 20:21) 
He said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”

(Matthew 20:22) 
But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am going to drink?”

(Matthew 20:23) 
They said to him, “We are able.” Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right and left is not mine to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”

(Matthew 20:24) 
When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with the two brothers.

(Matthew 20:25) 
But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

(Matthew 20:26) 
It shall not be this way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,

(Matthew 20:27) 
and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave,

(Matthew 20:28) 
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

(Matthew 20:29) 
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.

(Matthew 20:30) 
And two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by. They cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

(Matthew 20:31) 
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

(Matthew 20:32) 
Jesus stopped and called them. He asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”

(Matthew 20:33) 
They said to him, “Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.”

(Matthew 20:34) 
Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.

(Matthew 21:1) 
When they drew near to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,

(Matthew 21:2) 
saying to them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.”

(Matthew 21:3) 
If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord has need of them, and immediately he will let them go.”

(Matthew 21:4) 
All this happened so that what was spoken by the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,

(Matthew 21:5) 
“Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, and a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”

(Matthew 21:6) 
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.

(Matthew 21:7) 
They brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments on them, and He sat on them.

(Matthew 21:8) 
Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

(Matthew 21:9) 
The crowds, who went before Him and who followed Him, cried out, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”

(Matthew 21:10) 
And when He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”

(Matthew 21:11) 
The crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.”

(Matthew 21:12) 
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.

(Matthew 21:13) 
He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers.”

(Matthew 21:14) 
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.

(Matthew 21:15) 
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.

(Matthew 21:16) 
And they said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise’?”

(Matthew 21:17) 
And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.

(Matthew 21:18) 
Now in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.

(Matthew 21:19) 
Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went to it and found nothing on it except leaves, and He said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again.” And immediately the fig tree withered.

(Matthew 21:20) 
Seeing this, the disciples were amazed, and said, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”

(Matthew 21:21) 
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.

(Matthew 21:22) 
And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

(Matthew 21:23) 
And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, “By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”

(Matthew 21:24) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.

(Matthew 21:25) 
The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?” They reasoned with themselves, saying,

(Matthew 21:26) 
“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.”

(Matthew 21:27) 
So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Matthew 21:28) 
“But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’

(Matthew 21:29) 
“And he answered and said, ‘I will not’; but afterward he regretted it and went.

(Matthew 21:30) 
“The man came to the second and said the same thing. And he answered and said, ‘I will, sir’; but he did not go.

(Matthew 21:31) 
“Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.

(Matthew 21:32) 
“For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.

(Matthew 21:33) 
“Hear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.

(Matthew 21:34) 
“When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his fruits.

(Matthew 21:35) 
“The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.

(Matthew 21:36) 
“Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they did the same to them.

(Matthew 21:37) 
“Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

(Matthew 21:38) 
“But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’

(Matthew 21:39) 
“And they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

(Matthew 21:40) 
“Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?”

(Matthew 21:41) 
They said to Him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the fruits in their seasons.”

(Matthew 21:42) 
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, This became the chief corner stone; This came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

(Matthew 21:43) 
“Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruit of it.

(Matthew 21:44) 
“And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

(Matthew 21:45) 
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.

(Matthew 21:46) 
And although they sought to arrest Him, they feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet.

(Matthew 22:1) 
Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying:

(Matthew 22:2) 
“The kingdom of the universe is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.

(Matthew 22:3) 
He sent his servants to summon those who were invited, but they refused to come.

(Matthew 22:4) 
Then he sent more servants, saying, ‘Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet!’

(Matthew 22:5) 
But they paid no attention and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his business.

(Matthew 22:6) 
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.

(Matthew 22:7) 
The king was enraged and sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their cities.

(Matthew 22:8) 
Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

(Matthew 22:9) 
Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the banquet whomever you find.’

(Matthew 22:10) 
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

(Matthew 22:11) 
But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in a wedding garment.

(Matthew 22:12) 
He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And the man was speechless.

(Matthew 22:13) 
Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.’

(Matthew 22:14) 
For many are called, but few are chosen.”

(Matthew 22:15) 
Then the Pharisees went off and plotted how to trap Jesus in what he said.

(Matthew 22:16) 
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth, and you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status.

(Matthew 22:17) 
So tell us your opinion: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

(Matthew 22:18) 
But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites?

(Matthew 22:19) 
Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.

(Matthew 22:20) 
Then he said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?”

(Matthew 22:21) 
They replied, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “So give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”

(Matthew 22:22) 
When they heard this, they were amazed, and they left him and went away.

(Matthew 22:23) 
On that day, the Sadducees came to him, saying that there is no resurrection, and they questioned him,

(Matthew 22:24) 
saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’

(Matthew 22:25) 
Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.

(Matthew 22:26) 
The same happened with the second and the third, down to the seventh.

(Matthew 22:27) 
Finally, the woman died.

(Matthew 22:28) 
In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had been married to her.”

(Matthew 22:29) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.

(Matthew 22:30) 
For in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but they will be like the angels of God in the universe.

(Matthew 22:31) 
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said:

(Matthew 22:32) 
‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”

(Matthew 22:33) 
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

(Matthew 22:34) 
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

(Matthew 22:35) 
And one of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:

(Matthew 22:36) 
“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”

(Matthew 22:37) 
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”

(Matthew 22:38) 
This is the greatest and first commandment.

(Matthew 22:39) 
And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’

(Matthew 22:40) 
On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”

(Matthew 22:41) 
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

(Matthew 22:42) 
saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”

(Matthew 22:43) 
They said to him, “David’s.”

(Matthew 22:44) 
He said to them, “Then how is it that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying:

(Matthew 22:45) 
‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.”’

(Matthew 22:46) 
If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”

(Matthew 22:47) 
No one could answer him a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him any further.

(Matthew 23:1) 
Jesus then spoke to the crowds of people and to His disciples,

(Matthew 23:2) 
saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their place as the official teachers of Moses' Law."

(Matthew 23:3) 
Therefore, you must observe and do everything they tell you, because they teach God's Law. But do not live according to their works, for they say one thing and do not practice what they preach.

(Matthew 23:4) 
They tie up heavy, burdensome loads of rules and regulations and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves are unwilling to move these burdens with even a single finger.

(Matthew 23:5) 
All of their works are done to be seen and admired by other people. They make their phylacteries very broad—these are the small boxes containing Scripture worn on the forehead and arm during prayer—and they make the fringes of their garments very long.

(Matthew 23:6) 
They love the places of honor at dinner parties and the most prominent seats in the synagogues, which are places of worship and community gathering.

(Matthew 23:7) 
They love greetings of respect in the marketplaces, and they love to be called 'Rabbi'—meaning 'my great one' or 'my master'—by people.

(Matthew 23:8) 
But you, my followers, must not allow yourselves to be called 'Rabbi,' for only one is your Master, who is Christ. All of you are brothers and sisters in Christ.

(Matthew 23:9) 
Do not call anyone on earth your 'father' in a spiritual sense, for you have only one Father, who is in heaven.

(Matthew 23:10) 
Nor are you to be called 'teachers' or 'guides' in this way, for your one and only true Teacher is Christ.

(Matthew 23:11) 
Whoever is greatest among you must be your servant.

(Matthew 23:12) 
For whoever humbles himself will be exalted by God. And whoever exalts himself will be humbled by God.

(Matthew 23:13) 
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter it, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in.

(Matthew 23:14) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses—meaning you exploit and steal from vulnerable women—while making long, showy prayers. Because of this, you will receive a greater judgment from God.

(Matthew 23:15) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you travel across the sea and the dry land to make one convert to Judaism. And when he is made a convert, you make him twice as much a child of Gehenna—a place of eternal punishment and destruction—as yourselves.

(Matthew 23:16) 
Woe to you, you blind guides! You teach, 'Whoever swears an oath by the Temple, it means nothing. But whoever swears an oath by the gold of the Temple, that oath is binding.'

(Matthew 23:17) 
You are foolish and blind! For which is greater: the gold, or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?

(Matthew 23:18) 
And you also say, 'Whoever swears an oath by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever swears an oath by the gift that is on the altar, that oath is binding.'

(Matthew 23:19) 
You are blind! For which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

(Matthew 23:20) 
Therefore, whoever swears an oath by the altar is swearing an oath by it and by everything that is on it.

(Matthew 23:21) 
And whoever swears an oath by the Temple is swearing an oath by it and by God, who dwells within it.

(Matthew 23:22) 
And whoever swears an oath by heaven is swearing an oath by God's throne and by God Himself, who sits upon it.

(Matthew 23:23) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you carefully tithe even the smallest garden herbs like mint, dill, and cumin. Yet you have neglected the more important matters of the Law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness to God. You ought to have practiced these weightier matters without neglecting the others.

(Matthew 23:24) 
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat from your drink, yet you swallow a camel. This means you obsess over minor rules but ignore major commands of God.

(Matthew 23:25) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside, they are full of greed, extortion, and impurity.

(Matthew 23:26) 
You blind Pharisee! First, clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become truly clean. This is about inner spiritual purity before outward appearance.

(Matthew 23:27) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful and clean on the outside to people. But inside, they are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of filth and impurity.

(Matthew 23:28) 
In the same way, on the outside, you appear righteous to people. But inside, you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

(Matthew 23:29) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the memorials of the righteous.

(Matthew 23:30) 
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'

(Matthew 23:31) 
So you yourselves bear witness against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.

(Matthew 23:32) 
Go on, then, and fill up the measure of your ancestors' guilt.

(Matthew 23:33) 
You serpents, you brood of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of Gehenna—the place of eternal punishment?

(Matthew 23:34) 
Therefore, behold, I am sending to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues, and you will persecute them from city to city.

(Matthew 23:35) 
This is so that all the righteous blood shed on the earth may come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar.

(Matthew 23:36) 
Truly, I tell you, all these things will come upon this present generation.

(Matthew 23:37) 
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I longed to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling to let me!

(Matthew 23:38) 
Behold, your house—meaning your Temple and your city—is being left to you desolate and deserted.

(Matthew 23:39) 
For I tell you, you will not see Me again from now on until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.'

(Matthew 24:24:1) 
And as Jesus was leaving the Temple, He was going away. Then His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the Temple.

(Matthew 24:24:2) 
But He, answering, said to them: "Do you see all these things? Truly, I tell you, not a single stone will be left here upon another stone that will not be thrown down (destroyed)."

(Matthew 24:24:3) 
And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, His disciples came to Him privately, saying: "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age (the completion of time as we know it)?"

(Matthew 24:24:4) 
And Jesus, answering, said to them: "Be careful that no one misleads you:

(Matthew 24:24:5) 
for many will come in my name, saying: 'I am the Anointed One (the Christ)!' and they will mislead many people.

(Matthew 24:24:6) 
For you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed; for it is necessary for these things to happen, but the end is not yet.

(Matthew 24:24:7) 
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be plagues (diseases), and famines, and earthquakes in various places:

(Matthew 24:24:8) 
but all these things are only the beginning of sorrows (or birth pangs).

(Matthew 24:24:9) 
Then they will hand you over to tribulation, and they will kill you; and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.

(Matthew 24:24:10) 
And then many will be scandalized (will fall away from the faith into sin or unbelief), and they will betray one another, and they will hate one another.

(Matthew 24:24:11) 
And many false prophets will rise up, and they will mislead many.

(Matthew 24:24:12) 
And because wickedness has abounded (will increase greatly), the charity (the supernatural love for God and neighbor) of many will grow cold.

(Matthew 24:24:13) 
But he who perseveres (remains steadfast in faith and good works) to the end will be saved.

(Matthew 24:24:14) 
And this Gospel (Good News) of the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world (the entire planet), as a testimony to all nations: and then the end (the consummation of all things) will come.

(Matthew 24:24:15) 
Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place — whoever reads, let him understand:

(Matthew 24:24:16) 
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains:

(Matthew 24:24:17) 
and let him who is on the housetop (the flat roof of his house) not come down to take anything from his house:

(Matthew 24:24:18) 
and let him who is in the field not return to get his cloak.

(Matthew 24:24:19) 
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!

(Matthew 24:24:20) 
And pray that your flight (fleeing) may not be in winter, or on the Sabbath (when travel was restricted by religious law):

(Matthew 24:24:21) 
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be.

(Matthew 24:24:22) 
And unless those days had been shortened, no living thing (no human life) would be saved: but for the sake of the elect (God's chosen people) those days will be shortened.

(Matthew 24:24:23) 
Then if anyone says to you: 'Look, here is the Anointed One (the Christ)!' or 'There!', do not believe it.

(Matthew 24:24:24) 
For false Anointed Ones (false Christs) and false prophets will arise: and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if it were possible, even the elect (God's chosen people).

(Matthew 24:24:25) 
Behold, I have told you beforehand.

(Matthew 24:24:26) 
Therefore, if they say to you: 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out: 'Look, He is in the inner rooms (secret chambers)!' do not believe it.

(Matthew 24:24:27) 
For just as lightning comes from the East and flashes even to the West across the sky: so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:28) 
Wherever the dead body (carrion) is, there the eagles (vultures) will gather.

(Matthew 24:24:29) 
But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky (the visible cosmos), and the celestial powers (the spiritual forces of the heavens) will be shaken.

(Matthew 24:24:30) 
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky: and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn (lament): and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with great power and majesty.

(Matthew 24:24:31) 
And He will send His Angels with a trumpet call and a loud voice: and they will gather His elect (His chosen people) from the four winds (from all directions), from one end of the universe to the other (from the highest reaches of the cosmos to its very ends).

(Matthew 24:24:32) 
Now learn a parable (a lesson) from the fig tree: When its branch is already tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:

(Matthew 24:24:33) 
So also, when you see all these things, know that He (the time of His coming) is near, at the doors.

(Matthew 24:24:34) 
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened (come to pass).

(Matthew 24:24:35) 
The universe and the earth will pass away (will come to an end), but my words will not pass away (will endure forever).

(Matthew 24:24:36) 
But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the Angels of the heavens (the spiritual realms), but the Father alone.

(Matthew 24:24:37) 
For just as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:38) 
For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,

(Matthew 24:24:39) 
and they did not understand (or know) until the flood came and swept them all away: so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:40) 
Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken (assumed to God), and the other will be left behind.

(Matthew 24:24:41) 
Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken (assumed to God), and one will be left behind.

(Matthew 24:24:42) 
Therefore, be vigilant (keep watch), for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.

(Matthew 24:24:43) 
But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would certainly have kept watch, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into (dug through).

(Matthew 24:24:44) 
Therefore, you also be ready: for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.

(Matthew 24:24:45) 
Who then, do you think, is the faithful and prudent (wise) servant, whom his master has set over his household (his family), to give them food at the proper time?

(Matthew 24:24:46) 
Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find doing so (carrying out his duty faithfully).

(Matthew 24:24:47) 
Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions (all his property).

(Matthew 24:24:48) 
But if that wicked servant says in his heart: 'My master delays his coming (is taking a long time to return):'

(Matthew 24:24:49) 
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with drunkards:

(Matthew 24:24:50) 
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour when he does not know (is unaware):

(Matthew 24:24:51) 
and will cut him in pieces (severely punish him), and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 25:1) 
At that time, the Kingdom of God will be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

(Matthew 25:2) 
Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.

(Matthew 25:3) 
The foolish ones, when they took their lamps, did not take any oil for them.

(Matthew 25:4) 
But the wise ones took oil in their containers along with their lamps.

(Matthew 25:5) 
As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and fell asleep.

(Matthew 25:6) 
But at midnight, a shout was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him!'

(Matthew 25:7) 
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps, preparing them to burn brightly.

(Matthew 25:8) 
But the foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.'

(Matthew 25:9) 
The wise ones answered, saying, 'No, there probably won't be enough for us and for you. Instead, go to those who sell and buy some for yourselves.'

(Matthew 25:10) 
While they were on their way to buy, the bridegroom arrived. And those who were prepared went in with him to the wedding feast, and then the door was shut.

(Matthew 25:11) 
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'

(Matthew 25:12) 
But he answered, saying, 'Truly, I tell you, I do not know you.'

(Matthew 25:13) 
Therefore, stay awake and be vigilant, because you do not know the day nor the hour of My return.

(Matthew 25:14) 
For it is just like a man who, going on a journey, called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.

(Matthew 25:15) 
To one, he gave five talents—a very large sum of money or skill. To another, he gave two, and to another, one, to each according to his own ability. And then he immediately left on his journey.

(Matthew 25:16) 
Then the one who had received five talents immediately went and traded with them, and he gained another five talents.

(Matthew 25:17) 
Similarly, the one who had received two talents also gained another two.

(Matthew 25:18) 
But the one who had received one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.

(Matthew 25:19) 
Now, after a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them, requiring each to explain how they used what was given to them.

(Matthew 25:20) 
And the one who had received five talents came forward and brought another five talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me. Behold, I have gained another five on top of that amount!'

(Matthew 25:21) 
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! Because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many things. Come, enter into the joy of your master!'

(Matthew 25:22) 
Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. Behold, I have gained another two on top of that amount!'

(Matthew 25:23) 
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! Because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many things. Come, enter into the joy of your master!'

(Matthew 25:24) 
Then the one who had received one talent also came forward and said, 'Master, I knew that you are a harsh man. You reap where you have not sown, and you gather where you have not scattered any seed.'

(Matthew 25:25) 
And so, out of fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground. Behold, here you have what is yours back again.

(Matthew 25:26) 
But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered!'

(Matthew 25:27) 
Therefore, you should have entrusted my money to the bankers, and then, when I returned, I would have received what is mine with interest, a profit on my investment.

(Matthew 25:28) 
So, take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents.

(Matthew 25:29) 
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him.

(Matthew 25:30) 
And cast this useless servant into the outer darkness, the place of suffering and separation from God. There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth in despair.

(Matthew 25:31) 
When the Son of Man comes in His divine majesty, and all the Angels are with Him, then He will sit upon the throne of His glory.

(Matthew 25:32) 
And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

(Matthew 25:33) 
And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.

(Matthew 25:34) 
Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the very foundation of the world.'

(Matthew 25:35) 
For I was hungry, and you gave Me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink. I was a stranger, a foreigner in your land, and you welcomed Me into your home.

(Matthew 25:36) 
I was naked, and you clothed Me. I was sick, and you visited Me. I was in prison, and you came to Me.

(Matthew 25:37) 
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?'

(Matthew 25:38) 
Or when did we see You a stranger and welcome You in, or naked and clothe You?

(Matthew 25:39) 
Or when did we see You sick or in prison and come to You?

(Matthew 25:40) 
And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly, I tell you, just as you did it for one of the least of these, My brothers and sisters in faith, you did it for Me.'

(Matthew 25:41) 
Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, not for you.'

(Matthew 25:42) 
For I was hungry, and you gave Me no food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink.

(Matthew 25:43) 
I was a stranger, a foreigner, and you did not welcome Me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe Me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.

(Matthew 25:44) 
Then they also will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and fail to minister to Your needs?'

(Matthew 25:45) 
Then He will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I tell you, just as you did not do it for one of the least of these My brothers and sisters, you did not do it for Me.'

(Matthew 25:46) 
And these will go away into eternal punishment, the ultimate consequence of their choices, but the righteous will go into eternal life, the unending union with God.

(Matthew 26:26:1) 
It came to pass that when Jesus had finished all these discourses, He said to His disciples:

(Matthew 26:26:2) 
“You know that the Passover is coming in two days, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to be crucified.”

(Matthew 26:26:3) 
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.

(Matthew 26:26:4) 
And they formed a plan to seize Jesus by cunning and kill Him.

(Matthew 26:26:5) 
However, they were saying: “Not during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”

(Matthew 26:26:6) 
Now, when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

(Matthew 26:26:7) 
a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it over His head as He was reclining at the table.

(Matthew 26:26:8) 
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying: “Why this waste?

(Matthew 26:26:9) 
This ointment could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.”

(Matthew 26:26:10) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: “Why are you troubling this woman? For she has done a good work for me.

(Matthew 26:26:11) 
For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.

(Matthew 26:26:12) 
For by pouring this ointment on my body, she has done this as preparation for my burial.

(Matthew 26:26:13) 
Amen, I say to you, wherever this Gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.”

(Matthew 26:26:14) 
Then one of the twelve disciples, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.

(Matthew 26:26:15) 
And he said to them: “What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you?” And they weighed out and agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver.

(Matthew 26:26:16) 
And from that time on, he sought an opportunity to betray Jesus.

(Matthew 26:26:17) 
Now, on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”

(Matthew 26:26:18) 
But Jesus said: “Go into the city to a certain man and say to him: ‘The Teacher says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”

(Matthew 26:26:19) 
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Matthew 26:26:20) 
When evening came, He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.

(Matthew 26:26:21) 
And as they were eating, He said: “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”

(Matthew 26:26:22) 
And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each one began to say: “Surely it is not I, Lord?”

(Matthew 26:26:23) 
But He answered and said: “The one who dips his hand with me into the dish, he will betray me.”

(Matthew 26:26:24) 
“The Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.”

(Matthew 26:26:25) 
Then Judas, who was betraying Him, responded and said: “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus said to him: “You have said it.”

(Matthew 26:26:26) 
Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to His disciples, and said: “Take and eat; this is my Body.”

(Matthew 26:26:27) 
And taking the chalice, He gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: “Drink from this, all of you.”

(Matthew 26:26:28) 
“For this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which will be poured out for many unto the remission of sins.”

(Matthew 26:26:29) 
“And I say to you: I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.”

(Matthew 26:26:30) 
And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

(Matthew 26:26:31) 
Then Jesus said to them: “All of you will stumble because of me this very night. For it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’”

(Matthew 26:26:32) 
“But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.”

(Matthew 26:26:33) 
Peter responded and said to Him: “Even if all others stumble because of you, I will never stumble.”

(Matthew 26:26:34) 
Jesus said to him: “Amen, I say to you, that on this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”

(Matthew 26:26:35) 
Peter said to Him: “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And all the disciples said the same.

(Matthew 26:26:36) 
Then Jesus came with them to a country estate called Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples: “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”

(Matthew 26:26:37) 
And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, He began to be sorrowful and distressed.

(Matthew 26:26:38) 
Then He said to them: “My soul is sorrowful, even to the point of death. Remain here and keep watch with me.”

(Matthew 26:26:39) 
And going forward a little, He fell on His face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”

(Matthew 26:26:40) 
And He came to His disciples and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter: “So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?”

(Matthew 26:26:41) 
“Keep watch and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

(Matthew 26:26:42) 
Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying: “My Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, then your will be done.”

(Matthew 26:26:43) 
And He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

(Matthew 26:26:44) 
And leaving them again, He went away and prayed a third time, saying the same words.

(Matthew 26:26:45) 
Then He came to His disciples and said to them: “Sleep now and take your rest. Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners.”

(Matthew 26:26:46) 
“Rise, let us go! Behold, he who is betraying me has drawn near.”

(Matthew 26:26:47) 
And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.

(Matthew 26:26:48) 
Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying: “Whomever I kiss, that is He; seize Him.”

(Matthew 26:26:49) 
And immediately he came to Jesus and said: “Hail, Rabbi!” And he kissed Him.

(Matthew 26:26:50) 
Jesus said to him: “Friend, for what purpose have you come?” Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and seized Him.

(Matthew 26:26:51) 
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.

(Matthew 26:26:52) 
Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all who take up the sword will perish by the sword.”

(Matthew 26:26:53) 
“Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and He would immediately send me more than twelve legions of angels?”

(Matthew 26:26:54) 
“How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen in this way?”

(Matthew 26:26:55) 
At that very hour, Jesus said to the crowds: “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to apprehend me? Day after day I sat teaching among you in the Temple, and you did not seize me.”

(Matthew 26:26:56) 
“But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.

(Matthew 26:26:57) 
Then those who had seized Jesus led Him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and elders were gathered.

(Matthew 26:26:58) 
But Peter followed Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and sat with the servants to see the outcome.

(Matthew 26:26:59) 
Now the chief priests and the entire council were seeking false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.

(Matthew 26:26:60) 
But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last, however, two false witnesses came,

(Matthew 26:26:61) 
and they said: “This man said: ‘I can destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”

(Matthew 26:26:62) 
And the high priest stood up and said to Him: “Do you answer nothing concerning what these men testify against you?”

(Matthew 26:26:63) 
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him: “I put you under oath by the Living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”

(Matthew 26:26:64) 
Jesus said to him: “You have said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power of God, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”

(Matthew 26:26:65) 
Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.

(Matthew 26:26:66) 
What do you think?” And they answered and said: “He is guilty of death.”

(Matthew 26:26:67) 
Then they spit in His face and struck Him with their fists. Others slapped Him in the face,

(Matthew 26:26:68) 
saying: “Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who is it that struck you?”

(Matthew 26:26:69) 
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying: “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”

(Matthew 26:26:70) 
But he denied it before everyone, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”

(Matthew 26:26:71) 
And when he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there: “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”

(Matthew 26:26:72) 
And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”

(Matthew 26:26:73) 
And after a little while, those who were standing by came and said to Peter: “Certainly, you too are one of them, for your dialect and accent betray you.”

(Matthew 26:26:74) 
Then he began to curse and swear, saying that he did not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed.

(Matthew 26:26:75) 
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which He had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And going outside, he wept bitterly.

(Matthew 27:1) 
When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people met together to conspire against Jesus and to put Him to death.

(Matthew 27:2) 
They bound Him, led Him away, and gave Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.

(Matthew 27:3) 
When Judas, who betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,

(Matthew 27:4) 
saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? You take care of it."

(Matthew 27:5) 
So Judas threw the silver into the temple, left, and went and hanged himself.

(Matthew 27:6) 
The chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, since it is blood money."

(Matthew 27:7) 
They conferred and bought the potter's field with the money, to be used as a burial place for strangers.

(Matthew 27:8) 
Therefore, that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.

(Matthew 27:9) 
Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one whose worth was set by the sons of Israel,

(Matthew 27:10) 
and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

(Matthew 27:11) 
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You have said it."

(Matthew 27:12) 
But when He was accused by the chief priests and the elders, He made no reply.

(Matthew 27:13) 
Then Pilate said to Him, "Do you not hear how many things they are accusing You of?"

(Matthew 27:14) 
But He did not answer him one word, so the governor was greatly amazed.

(Matthew 27:15) 
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner whom they wanted.

(Matthew 27:16) 
At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

(Matthew 27:17) 
So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"

(Matthew 27:18) 
For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.

(Matthew 27:19) 
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."

(Matthew 27:20) 
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.

(Matthew 27:21) 
The governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."

(Matthew 27:22) 
Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let Him be crucified."

(Matthew 27:23) 
The governor said, "Why? What evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified."

(Matthew 27:24) 
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man’s blood; see to it yourselves."

(Matthew 27:25) 
And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"

(Matthew 27:26) 
Then he released Barabbas for them; but Jesus he scourged and handed over to be crucified.

(Matthew 27:27) 
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around Him.

(Matthew 27:28) 
And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.

(Matthew 27:29) 
And they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

(Matthew 27:30) 
And they spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head.

(Matthew 27:31) 
After they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.

(Matthew 27:32) 
As they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry His cross.

(Matthew 27:33) 
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,

(Matthew 27:34) 
they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink.

(Matthew 27:35) 
And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves by casting lots. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots."

(Matthew 27:36) 
And sitting down, they were guarding Him there.

(Matthew 27:37) 
And above His head they put up the charge against Him, which read, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."

(Matthew 27:38) 
Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.

(Matthew 27:39) 
And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads

(Matthew 27:40) 
and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."

(Matthew 27:41) 
In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying,

(Matthew 27:42) 
"He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him."

(Matthew 27:43) 
"He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He delights in Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"

(Matthew 27:44) 
The robbers who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him in the same way.

(Matthew 27:45) 
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came over all the land.

(Matthew 27:46) 
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"

(Matthew 27:47) 
And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, were saying, "This man is calling for Elijah."

(Matthew 27:48) 
Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.

(Matthew 27:49) 
But the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him."

(Matthew 27:50) 
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.

(Matthew 27:51) 
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split,

(Matthew 27:52) 
and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;

(Matthew 27:53) 
and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.

(Matthew 27:54) 
Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"

(Matthew 27:55) 
Many women were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.

(Matthew 27:56) 
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

(Matthew 27:57) 
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.

(Matthew 27:58) 
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.

(Matthew 27:59) 
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

(Matthew 27:60) 
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.

(Matthew 27:61) 
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.

(Matthew 27:62) 
Now on the next day, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,

(Matthew 27:63) 
and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I am to rise again.'

(Matthew 27:64) 
"So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."

(Matthew 27:65) 
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how."

(Matthew 27:66) 
And they went and made the tomb secure, and sealed the stone, along with the guard.

(Matthew 28:1) 
Late on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

(Matthew 28:2) 
Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from the universe. He approached the tomb, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.

(Matthew 28:3) 
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.

(Matthew 28:4) 
Because the guards were so terrified of him, they were terrified and became like dead men.

(Matthew 28:5) 
The angel spoke to the women, saying, “Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

(Matthew 28:6) 
He isn’t here. He has risen, just as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord was lying.

(Matthew 28:7) 
Then go quickly, and tell His disciples that He has risen. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see Him there. Behold, I have told you.”

(Matthew 28:8) 
So the women left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy. They ran to tell His disciples.

(Matthew 28:9) 
Suddenly, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They approached, held onto His feet, and worshipped Him.

(Matthew 28:10) 
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see Me there.”

(Matthew 28:11) 
While they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

(Matthew 28:12) 
When they had assembled with the elders, they took counsel and gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,

(Matthew 28:13) 
saying, “Tell everyone, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.’

(Matthew 28:14) 
And if the governor hears about this, we will persuade him and keep you out of trouble.”

(Matthew 28:15) 
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.

(Matthew 28:16) 
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had instructed them to go.

(Matthew 28:17) 
And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some still doubted.

(Matthew 28:18) 
Jesus came near and spoke to them, saying, “All power in the universe and on earth has been given to Me.

(Matthew 28:19) 
Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

(Matthew 28:20) 
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, even until the end of the age.”

(Mark 1:1) 
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

(Mark 1:2) 
Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way before you.”

(Mark 1:3) 
The voice of one crying in the desert: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.”

(Mark 1:4) 
John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

(Mark 1:5) 
And all the land of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

(Mark 1:6) 
And John was clothed in camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

(Mark 1:7) 
And he preached, saying: “There comes after me the One who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.”

(Mark 1:8) 
I have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”

(Mark 1:9) 
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

(Mark 1:10) 
And immediately, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open, and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.

(Mark 1:11) 
And there came a voice from the heavens: “You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.”

(Mark 1:12) 
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.

(Mark 1:13) 
And he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan; and he was with the beasts, and the angels ministered to him.

(Mark 1:14) 
And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God,

(Mark 1:15) 
and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the Gospel.”

(Mark 1:16) 
And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

(Mark 1:17) 
And Jesus said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men.”

(Mark 1:18) 
And immediately they left their nets and followed him.

(Mark 1:19) 
And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.

(Mark 1:20) 
And immediately he called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

(Mark 1:21) 
And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.

(Mark 1:22) 
And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

(Mark 1:23) 
And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

(Mark 1:24) 
saying: “What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.”

(Mark 1:25) 
And Jesus rebuked him, saying: “Be quiet, and come out of him.”

(Mark 1:26) 
And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.

(Mark 1:27) 
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying: “What is this? A new teaching with authority! For he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”

(Mark 1:28) 
And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the region of Galilee.

(Mark 1:29) 
And immediately, when they came out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

(Mark 1:30) 
Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.

(Mark 1:31) 
And he came and lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she served them.

(Mark 1:32) 
And when evening had come, after the sun went down, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.

(Mark 1:33) 
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.

(Mark 1:34) 
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.

(Mark 1:35) 
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and went to a lonely place, and there he prayed.

(Mark 1:36) 
And Simon and those who were with him followed him.

(Mark 1:37) 
And when they found him, they said to him: “Everyone is looking for you.”

(Mark 1:38) 
And he said to them: “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”

(Mark 1:39) 
And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

(Mark 1:40) 
And a leper came to him, beseeching him, and kneeling said to him: “If you will, you can make me clean.”

(Mark 1:41) 
And Jesus, moved with pity, stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.”

(Mark 1:42) 
And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.

(Mark 1:43) 
And immediately he sternly warned him and sent him away,

(Mark 1:44) 
and said to him: “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.”

(Mark 1:45) 
But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.

(Mark 2:1) 
Jesus returned to Capernaum a few days later.

(Mark 2:2) 
The news spread that he was at home.

(Mark 2:3) 
A crowd gathered, so many that there was no room left, not even near the door. Jesus began to preach the word of God to them.

(Mark 2:4) 
Some men arrived, carrying a paralytic. The men carried him.

(Mark 2:5) 
Because of the crowd, they couldn't bring him to Jesus. So, they uncovered the roof above where Jesus was and made an opening, then they lowered the man on his mat.

(Mark 2:6) 
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”

(Mark 2:7) 
Some scribes were sitting there, and they began to think to themselves:

(Mark 2:8) 
“Why does this man speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”

(Mark 2:9) 
Jesus, immediately aware in his spirit that they were thinking this, said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?”

(Mark 2:10) 
“Which is easier: to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?”

(Mark 2:11) 
“But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralytic,

(Mark 2:12) 
“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”

(Mark 2:13) 
He got up immediately, took his mat, and walked out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

(Mark 2:14) 
Jesus went out again to the sea, and the whole crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.

(Mark 2:15) 
As he was walking along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.

(Mark 2:16) 
While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.

(Mark 2:17) 
When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

(Mark 2:18) 
Hearing this, Jesus said to them, “Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

(Mark 2:19) 
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came to Jesus and asked, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”

(Mark 2:20) 
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?

(Mark 2:21) 
As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

(Mark 2:22) 
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.

(Mark 2:23) 
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece tears away from the old, and the tear becomes worse.

(Mark 2:24) 
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is to be put into new wineskins.”

(Mark 2:25) 
One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the grainfields, his disciples began to pick some heads of grain.

(Mark 2:26) 
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”

(Mark 2:27) 
He answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?

(Mark 2:28) 
He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for the priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions.”

(Mark 3:1) 
Again, He entered the synagogue. And there was a man there whose hand was shriveled.

(Mark 3:2) 
And they watched Him to see if He would heal on the Sabbath so that they could accuse Him.

(Mark 3:3) 
And He said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in the middle.”

(Mark 3:4) 
And He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent.

(Mark 3:5) 
And looking around at them with anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out; and his hand was restored.

(Mark 3:6) 
And immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to conspire against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.

(Mark 3:7) 
And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed Him,

(Mark 3:8) 
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan. And those near Tyre and Sidon, a great crowd, hearing all that He was doing, came to Him.

(Mark 3:9) 
And He told His disciples that a small boat should be ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they crush Him.

(Mark 3:10) 
For He healed many, so that all those who had afflictions were pressing Him in order to touch Him.

(Mark 3:11) 
And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and cry out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”

(Mark 3:12) 
And He sternly warned them not to make Him known.

(Mark 3:13) 
And going up on the mountain, He called to Him those whom He Himself willed, and they came to Him.

(Mark 3:14) 
And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,

(Mark 3:15) 
and have authority to cast out demons.

(Mark 3:16) 
And He appointed Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;

(Mark 3:17) 
and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder;

(Mark 3:18) 
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,

(Mark 3:19) 
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.

(Mark 3:20) 
And He went home. And the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat a meal.

(Mark 3:21) 
And when His family heard it, they went out to seize Him, for they were saying, “He is out of His mind.”

(Mark 3:22) 
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of demons He casts out demons.”

(Mark 3:23) 
And He called them to Himself and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?

(Mark 3:24) 
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

(Mark 3:25) 
And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.

(Mark 3:26) 
And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.

(Mark 3:27) 
But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.

(Mark 3:28) 
“Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter,

(Mark 3:29) 
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”

(Mark 3:30) 
For they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”

(Mark 3:31) 
And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to Him, calling Him.

(Mark 3:32) 
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are outside, seeking You.”

(Mark 3:33) 
And answering them, He said, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”

(Mark 3:34) 
And looking around at those who sat around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!

(Mark 3:35) 
For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”

(Mark 4:1) 
And again, He began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd gathered around Him, so that He entered a boat and sat on the sea. And all the crowd was on the land near the sea.

(Mark 4:2) 
And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching:

(Mark 4:3) 
Listen: behold, a sower went out to sow.

(Mark 4:4) 
And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the sky came and ate it up.

(Mark 4:5) 
And some fell upon stony ground where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.

(Mark 4:6) 
And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.

(Mark 4:7) 
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

(Mark 4:8) 
And some fell on good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased, and produced, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.

(Mark 4:9) 
And He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 4:10) 
And when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.

(Mark 4:11) 
And He said to them, “To you has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,

(Mark 4:12) 
so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they should turn and their sins be forgiven them.”

(Mark 4:13) 
And He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?

(Mark 4:14) 
The sower sows the word.

(Mark 4:15) 
And these are the ones by the wayside, where the word is sown. And immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.

(Mark 4:16) 
And these are the ones sown on stony ground: who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.

(Mark 4:17) 
And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they are scandalized.

(Mark 4:18) 
And these are the ones sown among thorns: they are those who hear the word,

(Mark 4:19) 
and the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

(Mark 4:20) 
And those are the ones sown on good ground: who hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.”

(Mark 4:21) 
And He said to them, “Does a lamp come to be put under a basket, or under a bed? Is it not to be put on a lampstand?

(Mark 4:22) 
For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.

(Mark 4:23) 
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 4:24) 
And He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be added.

(Mark 4:25) 
For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”

(Mark 4:26) 
And He said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed on the earth,

(Mark 4:27) 
and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.

(Mark 4:28) 
For the earth bears fruit of itself: first the blade, then the head, and then the full grain in the head.

(Mark 4:29) 
But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”

(Mark 4:30) 
And He said, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we present it?

(Mark 4:31) 
It is like a mustard seed which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;

(Mark 4:32) 
but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the sky can dwell under its shade.”

(Mark 4:33) 
And with many such parables, He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.

(Mark 4:34) 
But without a parable, He did not speak to them. But privately to His own disciples, He explained everything.

(Mark 4:35) 
And on that day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us pass over to the other side.”

(Mark 4:36) 
And leaving the crowd, they took Him along in the boat, and there were also other boats with Him.

(Mark 4:37) 
And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that it was already filling.

(Mark 4:38) 
But He was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”

(Mark 4:39) 
Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.

(Mark 4:40) 
And He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?”

(Mark 4:41) 
And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”

(Mark 5:1) 
They went to the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes. As soon as He disembarked from the boat, a man possessed by an evil spirit met Him there from the tombs,

(Mark 5:2) 
The man lived in the tombs. No one could bind him anymore, not even with chains.

(Mark 5:3) 
Often he had been bound with shackles and chains. But he would tear apart the chains and break the shackles, and no one could control him.

(Mark 5:4) 
Day and night among the tombs and in the mountains, he was constantly shouting and cutting himself with stones.

(Mark 5:5) 
Seeing Jesus from afar, he ran to Him and bowed down,

(Mark 5:6) 
shouting in a loud voice, “What have You to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me.”

(Mark 5:7) 
Jesus was already saying to him, “Come out, unclean spirit, from this man.”

(Mark 5:8) 
Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”

(Mark 5:9) 
And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.

(Mark 5:10) 
A large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.

(Mark 5:11) 
And the spirits begged Him, saying, “Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.”

(Mark 5:12) 
Jesus gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned there.

(Mark 5:13) 
Those who were tending them ran off and reported it in the city and the surrounding countryside. People went out to see what had happened.

(Mark 5:14) 
They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.

(Mark 5:15) 
Those who had seen what had happened told them the whole story about the demon-possessed man and the swine.

(Mark 5:16) 
Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.

(Mark 5:17) 
As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him to go with him.

(Mark 5:18) 
Jesus did not let him, but said to him, “Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.”

(Mark 5:19) 
So the man went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and all those who heard it were amazed.

(Mark 5:20) 
When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him, and He was by the sea.

(Mark 5:21) 
Then one of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came to Jesus. Seeing Him, he fell at His feet,

(Mark 5:22) 
and begged Him repeatedly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and put Your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.”

(Mark 5:23) 
So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around Him.

(Mark 5:24) 
And a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.

(Mark 5:25) 
She had heard about Jesus and came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His cloak,

(Mark 5:26) 
because she said, “If I just touch His clothes, I will be healed.”

(Mark 5:27) 
Immediately her flow of blood dried up, and she realized in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

(Mark 5:28) 
At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from Him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched My clothes?”

(Mark 5:29) 
His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing around You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’

(Mark 5:30) 
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

(Mark 5:31) 
The woman, knowing what had happened to her, came with fear and trembling, and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.

(Mark 5:32) 
He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free from your affliction.”

(Mark 5:33) 
While He was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue official’s house and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”

(Mark 5:34) 
But Jesus overheard what they were saying and said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”

(Mark 5:35) 
He allowed no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.

(Mark 5:36) 
They came to the home of the synagogue official, and Jesus saw a commotion, with people weeping and wailing loudly.

(Mark 5:37) 
When He entered, He said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.”

(Mark 5:38) 
And they laughed at Him. But He put them all out and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with Him and went in where the child was.

(Mark 5:39) 
Taking her by the hand, He said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”

(Mark 5:40) 
Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around (for she was twelve years old). And the people were utterly amazed.

(Mark 5:41) 
He gave them strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

(Mark 6:1) 
Jesus left that place and returned to His home country. His disciples followed Him.

(Mark 6:2) 
When the Sabbath arrived, He began teaching in the synagogue. Many people heard Him and were astonished by His teaching. They asked, “Where did He get these things? What is this wisdom given to Him? And what are these mighty works that are done by His hands?”

(Mark 6:3) 
“Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joseph, and Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him.

(Mark 6:4) 
Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.”

(Mark 6:5) 
And He could do no mighty works there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.

(Mark 6:6) 
And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went around teaching in the surrounding villages.

(Mark 6:7) 
He called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.

(Mark 6:8) 
He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff: no bag, no bread, and no money in their belts.

(Mark 6:9) 
They were to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.

(Mark 6:10) 
He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.

(Mark 6:11) 
And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them when you leave. Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.”

(Mark 6:12) 
So they went out and preached that people should repent.

(Mark 6:13) 
And they cast out many demons, and they anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed them.

(Mark 6:14) 
King Herod heard about Him, for His name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in Him.”

(Mark 6:15) 
Others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets.”

(Mark 6:16) 
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”

(Mark 6:17) 
For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.

(Mark 6:18) 
For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”

(Mark 6:19) 
And Herodias was angry with him and wanted to kill him, but she could not.

(Mark 6:20) 
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him.

(Mark 6:21) 
But when a convenient time came, Herod gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.

(Mark 6:22) 
When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who were with him. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”

(Mark 6:23) 
And he swore an oath to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even up to half of my kingdom.”

(Mark 6:24) 
She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”

(Mark 6:25) 
And immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter right away.”

(Mark 6:26) 
And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oath and because of those who were with him, he did not want to break his word to her.

(Mark 6:27) 
And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded that John’s head be brought. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,

(Mark 6:28) 
and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

(Mark 6:29) 
When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

(Mark 6:30) 
The apostles returned to Jesus and reported to Him all that they had done and taught.

(Mark 6:31) 
He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.

(Mark 6:32) 
And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.

(Mark 6:33) 
Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.

(Mark 6:34) 
When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.

(Mark 6:35) 
And when it was already late, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and it is already late.

(Mark 6:36) 
Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat, for they have nothing to eat.”

(Mark 6:37) 
But He answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to Him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?”

(Mark 6:38) 
And He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”

(Mark 6:39) 
Then He commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.

(Mark 6:40) 
They reclined in companies of hundreds and of fifties.

(Mark 6:41) 
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to the universe and blessed and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all.

(Mark 6:42) 
And they all ate and were satisfied.

(Mark 6:43) 
And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.

(Mark 6:44) 
Those who ate the loaves were about five thousand men.

(Mark 6:45) 
Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He sent the crowd away.

(Mark 6:46) 
And after He had taken leave of them, He went up on the mountain to pray.

(Mark 6:47) 
When evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and He was alone on the land.

(Mark 6:48) 
And seeing that they were straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, He came to them in the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them.

(Mark 6:49) 
But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost, and they cried out.

(Mark 6:50) 
For they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and said to them, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

(Mark 6:51) 
Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,

(Mark 6:52) 
because they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.

(Mark 6:53) 
When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.

(Mark 6:54) 
And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him

(Mark 6:55) 
and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to where they heard He was.

(Mark 6:56) 
And wherever He went, into villages or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch even the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.

(Mark 7:1) 
Then the Pharisees and some scribes came together to see Him, having traveled from Jerusalem.

(Mark 7:2) 
And when they saw some of His disciples eating food with hands that were not washed—that is, common hands—they criticized them.

(Mark 7:3) 
The Pharisees and all the Jews don't eat unless they wash their hands often, holding fast to the traditions of their elders:

(Mark 7:4) 
And after coming from the marketplace, they don't eat unless they wash first. There are many other traditions which they have received to keep, such as washing cups, jugs, bronze vessels, and beds.

(Mark 7:5) 
Then the Pharisees and scribes questioned Him: “Why do Your disciples not live according to the traditions of the elders, but eat food with common hands?”

(Mark 7:6) 
He responded by saying to them: “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.’

(Mark 7:7) 
‘In vain they worship Me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.’

(Mark 7:8) 
‘For, abandoning the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men: washing of jugs and cups, and many other similar things you do.’

(Mark 7:9) 
And He said to them: “You do very well at making the commandment of God invalid, so that you can establish your own tradition.”

(Mark 7:10) 
For Moses said: ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must surely die.’

(Mark 7:11) 
But you say: ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Corban” (which means, a gift), whatever profit you might have received from me,’

(Mark 7:12) 
you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,

(Mark 7:13) 
making the word of God invalid through your tradition, which you have handed down. And you do many things similar to these.”

(Mark 7:14) 
And, having called the crowd again, He said to them: “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand.

(Mark 7:15) 
There is nothing outside a man which, entering into him, can defile him; but the things which come out of the man, these are what defile the man.

(Mark 7:16) 
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 7:17) 
And when He entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.

(Mark 7:18) 
And He said to them: “Are you also as unintelligent? Don’t you understand that everything that enters a man from outside cannot defile him,

(Mark 7:19) 
because it doesn’t enter his heart, but his stomach, and it goes out into the latrine, eliminating all the food?”

(Mark 7:20) 
But He said, “What comes out of a man, that defiles the man.

(Mark 7:21) 
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders,

(Mark 7:22) 
adulteries, acts of greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.

(Mark 7:23) 
All these evils proceed from within and defile the man.”

(Mark 7:24) 
Then, getting up, He went away to the area of Tyre and Sidon. And, entering a house, He didn’t want anyone to know, and yet He couldn’t remain hidden.

(Mark 7:25) 
For a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit, immediately after hearing about Him, came and fell at His feet.

(Mark 7:26) 
The woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. And she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.

(Mark 7:27) 
He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

(Mark 7:28) 
But she responded, “Yes, Lord; but even the dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of the children.”

(Mark 7:29) 
And He said to her: “Because of this word, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”

(Mark 7:30) 
And going home, she found the girl lying on the bed, and the demon had gone out.

(Mark 7:31) 
Then, departing again from the territory of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the territory of the Decapolis.

(Mark 7:32) 
And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and mute. And they begged Him to place His hand on him.

(Mark 7:33) 
And, taking him away from the crowd privately, He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue.

(Mark 7:34) 
Then, looking up to the sky, He groaned and said to him, “Ephphatha,” which means, “Be opened.”

(Mark 7:35) 
And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he was speaking correctly.

(Mark 7:36) 
And He commanded them not to tell anyone. But as much as He commanded them, so much the more did they proclaim it:

(Mark 7:37) 
and they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak!”

(Mark 8:1) 
During those days, after a great crowd had gathered but didn't have anything to eat, Jesus summoned the disciples and told them:

(Mark 8:2) 
“I have pity on the crowd because they’ve been with me for three days, and they don’t have anything to eat.

(Mark 8:3) 
If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will weaken on the way, because some of them have come from far away.”

(Mark 8:4) 
His disciples responded to him: “How can someone possibly feed them with bread here in the desert?”

(Mark 8:5) 
Jesus then asked them: “How many loaves of bread do you have?” They replied: “Seven.”

(Mark 8:6) 
He ordered the crowd to recline on the ground. Then, taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the crowd. They did so.

(Mark 8:7) 
They also had a few small fish. Jesus blessed them and ordered that they be put before the crowd.

(Mark 8:8) 
Everyone ate and was satisfied. They collected what was left of the fragments—seven baskets full.

(Mark 8:9) 
There were about four thousand people eating, and Jesus sent them away.

(Mark 8:10) 
Immediately, He got into a boat with His disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.

(Mark 8:11) 
Then the Pharisees came out and began to debate with Him, asking for a sign from the sky, testing Him.

(Mark 8:12) 
He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”

(Mark 8:13) 
He left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side of the lake.

(Mark 8:14) 
They had forgotten to bring bread. They had only one loaf with them in the boat.

(Mark 8:15) 
Jesus then commanded them, saying: “Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”

(Mark 8:16) 
They reasoned among themselves, saying: “It’s because we have no bread.”

(Mark 8:17) 
Jesus, aware of this, said to them: “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Don’t you yet understand or comprehend? Do you still have hardened hearts?

(Mark 8:18) 
Do you have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear? Don’t you remember?

(Mark 8:19) 
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of fragments did you gather?” They said to Him: “Twelve.”

(Mark 8:20) 
“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets of fragments did you gather?” They said to Him: “Seven.”

(Mark 8:21) 
Then He said to them: “How is it that you still do not understand?”

(Mark 8:22) 
They came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged Him to touch him.

(Mark 8:23) 
Taking the blind man by the hand, He led him outside the village. Then, spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.

(Mark 8:24) 
The man looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking around.”

(Mark 8:25) 
Then Jesus laid His hands on his eyes again, and he saw clearly, and his sight was restored. He could then see everything perfectly.

(Mark 8:26) 
Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not go into the village.”

(Mark 8:27) 
Jesus and His disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He asked His disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”

(Mark 8:28) 
They replied, “John the Baptist. Others say Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.”

(Mark 8:29) 
Then He asked them, “But who do *you* say that I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”

(Mark 8:30) 
He strongly warned them not to tell anyone about Him.

(Mark 8:31) 
Jesus then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and then rise three days later.

(Mark 8:32) 
He spoke openly about this. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.

(Mark 8:33) 
But Jesus turned, and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan, because you are not thinking the things of God, but the things of men.”

(Mark 8:34) 
Then, calling the crowd to Himself along with His disciples, Jesus said to them: “If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.

(Mark 8:35) 
For whoever wants to save his own life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the Gospel will save it.

(Mark 8:36) 
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?

(Mark 8:37) 
Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

(Mark 8:38) 
If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.

(Mark 9:1) 
And He was telling them: “Truly, I say to you, some of those standing here will not experience death until they see the reign of God coming with power.”

(Mark 9:2) 
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, and led them up to a high mountain apart by themselves, and He was transfigured before them.

(Mark 9:3) 
And His garments became shining, extremely white as snow, of a whiteness no fuller on earth can produce.

(Mark 9:4) 
And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.

(Mark 9:5) 
Then Peter responded, and said to Jesus: “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. So, let us build three tabernacles—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

(Mark 9:6) 
For he did not know what he was saying, because they were overcome with fear.

(Mark 9:7) 
And a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying: “This is My beloved Son, hear Him.”

(Mark 9:8) 
And immediately, looking around, they saw no one any more, except Jesus only with them.

(Mark 9:9) 
And as they were coming down from the mountain, He commanded them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

(Mark 9:10) 
And they kept the word to themselves, questioning among themselves what this “rising from the dead” might be.

(Mark 9:11) 
And they questioned Him, saying: “Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

(Mark 9:12) 
Then He, answering, said to them: “Elijah does come first, and will restore all things. But how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be despised?

(Mark 9:13) 
But I tell you, that Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him.”

(Mark 9:14) 
And coming to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing with them.

(Mark 9:15) 
And immediately the whole crowd, seeing Jesus, were astonished, and running to Him, they greeted Him.

(Mark 9:16) 
And He asked them: “What are you disputing among yourselves?”

(Mark 9:17) 
And one of the crowd responded, and said: “Teacher, I brought my son to You because he has an unclean spirit.

(Mark 9:18) 
And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. And I told Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”

(Mark 9:19) 
Then He answered them: “O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring him to Me.”

(Mark 9:20) 
And they brought him to Him. And as soon as the spirit saw Him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. And falling on the ground, he rolled around, foaming at the mouth.

(Mark 9:21) 
And He asked his father: “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said: “From childhood.

(Mark 9:22) 
And often it has thrown him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if You can do anything, help us and have pity on us.”

(Mark 9:23) 
Jesus said to him: “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”

(Mark 9:24) 
And immediately the father of the boy cried out with tears, saying: “I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.”

(Mark 9:25) 
And when Jesus saw that the crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to it: “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.”

(Mark 9:26) 
And crying out and tearing him severely, it came out. And the boy became like a corpse, so that many said he was dead.

(Mark 9:27) 
But Jesus, taking his hand, lifted him up, and he arose.

(Mark 9:28) 
And when He had entered the house, His disciples asked Him privately: “Why could we not cast it out?”

(Mark 9:29) 
And He said to them: “This kind can be cast out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.”

(Mark 9:30) 
And departing from there, they were passing through Galilee. And He did not want anyone to know, because He was teaching His disciples, and He was saying to them: “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and being killed, after three days, He will rise.”

(Mark 9:31) 
But they did not understand the word, and they were afraid to ask Him.

(Mark 9:32) 
And they came to Capernaum. And when they had entered the house, He was asking them: “What were you arguing about on the way?”

(Mark 9:33) 
But they were silent, for on the way they had argued among themselves about who was the greatest.

(Mark 9:34) 
And sitting down, He called the twelve, and said to them: “If anyone wishes to be first, he will be last of all and the servant of all.”

(Mark 9:35) 
And taking a child, He set him in their midst, and embracing him, He said to them:

(Mark 9:36) 
“Whoever receives one of these children in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me, does not receive Me but Him who sent Me.”

(Mark 9:37) 
John answered Him, saying: “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, who does not follow us, and we forbade him.”

(Mark 9:38) 
But Jesus said: “Do not forbid him, for there is no one who does a mighty work in My name, and can soon speak evil of Me.”

(Mark 9:39) 
For he who is not against us is for us.

(Mark 9:40) 
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.

(Mark 9:41) 
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

(Mark 9:42) 
And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, than to having two hands, go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,

(Mark 9:43) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:44) 
And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into eternal life lame, than to having two feet, be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire,

(Mark 9:45) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:46) 
And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than to having two eyes, be cast into the hell of fire,

(Mark 9:47) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:48) 
For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.

(Mark 9:49) 
Salt is good, but if salt becomes tasteless, with what will you season it?

(Mark 9:50) 
Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace among yourselves.”

(Mark 10:1) 
And then, He rose and went into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. Again, the crowds gathered to Him, and He was teaching them again.

(Mark 10:2) 
And the Pharisees approached Him and questioned Him: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" They were trying to trip Him up.

(Mark 10:3) 
But He answering, said to them: "What did Moses command you?"

(Mark 10:4) 
They said: "Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away."

(Mark 10:5) 
To whom Jesus answering, said: "Because of the hardness of your hearts, he wrote you this commandment."

(Mark 10:6) 
But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.

(Mark 10:7) 
For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife.

(Mark 10:8) 
And the two will be in one flesh. Therefore, they are no longer two, but one flesh.

(Mark 10:9) 
What God has joined together, let no man separate."

(Mark 10:10) 
And in the house, the disciples again questioned Him about the same matter.

(Mark 10:11) 
And He said to them: "Whoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.

(Mark 10:12) 
And if a woman puts away her husband, and is married to another, she commits adultery.

(Mark 10:13) 
And they were bringing little children to Him, that He might touch them. But the disciples were rebuking those who were bringing them.

(Mark 10:14) 
When Jesus saw this, He was indignant, and said to them: "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them: for of such is the kingdom of God.

(Mark 10:15) 
Amen I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God, as a child, will not enter into it."

(Mark 10:16) 
And embracing them, and imposing hands upon them, He blessed them.

(Mark 10:17) 
And as He was going out into the way, a certain man, running up and kneeling to Him, was asking Him: "Good Master, what must I do that I may receive eternal life?"

(Mark 10:18) 
And Jesus said to him: "Why do you call Me good? No one is good, but God alone.

(Mark 10:19) 
You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Do not commit fraud. Honor your father and your mother.'

(Mark 10:20) 
But he answering, said to Him: "Master, I have kept all these things from my youth."

(Mark 10:21) 
And Jesus looking upon him, loved him, and said to him: "One thing is lacking to you: go, sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow Me."

(Mark 10:22) 
But he, being saddened by the word, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

(Mark 10:23) 
And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples: "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"

(Mark 10:24) 
But the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus again answering, said to them: "Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"

(Mark 10:25) 
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

(Mark 10:26) 
And they were much more astonished, saying among themselves: "Who then can be saved?"

(Mark 10:27) 
And Jesus, looking upon them, said: "With men it is impossible; but not with God. For all things are possible with God."

(Mark 10:28) 
And Peter began to say to Him: "Behold, we have left all things, and have followed You."

(Mark 10:29) 
Jesus answering, said: "Amen I say to you, there is no one who has left home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for My sake, and for the Gospel,

(Mark 10:30) 
who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life everlasting.

(Mark 10:31) 
But many that are first will be last, and the last will be first."

(Mark 10:32) 
And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus was preceding them, and they were astonished: and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, He began to tell them the things that were to happen to Him.

(Mark 10:33) 
Saying: "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests, and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and will deliver Him to the Gentiles:

(Mark 10:34) 
And they will mock Him, and spit upon Him, and scourge Him, and kill Him: and the third day He will rise again."

(Mark 10:35) 
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, saying: "Master, we want You to do whatever we ask."

(Mark 10:36) 
But He said to them: "What do you want Me to do for you?"

(Mark 10:37) 
And they said to Him: "Grant to us that one of us may sit at Your right hand, and the other at Your left, in Your glory."

(Mark 10:38) 
But Jesus said to them: "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the chalice that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"

(Mark 10:39) 
They said to Him: "We can." And Jesus said to them: "The chalice indeed that I drink, you shall drink: and with the baptism that I am baptized, you shall be baptized.

(Mark 10:40) 
But to sit at My right hand or at My left is not Mine to give to you, but to those for whom it is prepared."

(Mark 10:41) 
And the ten hearing it, began to be indignant at James and John.

(Mark 10:42) 
But Jesus calling them, said to them: "You know that those who are seen to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them: and their great ones exercise power over them.

(Mark 10:43) 
But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will become greater among you, will be your servant:

(Mark 10:44) 
and whoever will want to be first among you, will be the servant of all.

(Mark 10:45) 
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a redemption for many."

(Mark 10:46) 
And they came to Jericho. And as He was departing from Jericho, and with His disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.

(Mark 10:47) 
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say: "Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me."

(Mark 10:48) 
And many were rebuking him, that he should be quiet: but he cried out much more: "Son of David, have mercy on me."

(Mark 10:49) 
And Jesus standing, ordered him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying to him: "Have confidence: arise, He calls you."

(Mark 10:50) 
Who, casting off his garment, leaping up, came to Him.

(Mark 10:51) 
And answering, Jesus said to him: "What do you want Me to do for you?" The blind man said to Him: "Rabboni, that I may see."

(Mark 10:52) 
And Jesus said to him: "Go your way; your faith has made you safe." And immediately he saw and followed Him in the way.

(Mark 11:1) 
As He approached Jerusalem, and the towns of Bethany and Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,

(Mark 11:2) 
saying to them: “Go into the village which is in front of you. Entering into it right away, you will find a colt tied up. No one has ever ridden on it. Untie it, and bring it.”

(Mark 11:3) 
“If anyone asks you, ‘What are you doing?’ Say that the Lord has need of it, and He will send it back here immediately.”

(Mark 11:4) 
So they went off and found the colt tied up at a door outside, at a fork in the road, and they untied it.

(Mark 11:5) 
Some of those standing there said to them: “What are you doing, untying the colt?”

(Mark 11:6) 
They replied as Jesus had told them to, and they let them go.

(Mark 11:7) 
Then they brought the colt to Jesus. They put their cloaks on it, and He sat upon it.

(Mark 11:8) 
And many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut down branches from the trees and scattered them on the road.

(Mark 11:9) 
And those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, saying: “Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”

(Mark 11:10) 
“Blessed is the kingdom of our father David, which is coming! Hosanna in the highest!”

(Mark 11:11) 
He entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And after looking around at everything, since it was already late in the day, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.

(Mark 11:12) 
On the next day, as they were leaving Bethany, He became hungry.

(Mark 11:13) 
Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He could find anything on it. When He went up to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.

(Mark 11:14) 
Then He said to it: “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And His disciples heard it.

(Mark 11:15) 
And they went to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those selling and buying in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.

(Mark 11:16) 
He would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.

(Mark 11:17) 
And He taught them, saying to them: “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of thieves.”

(Mark 11:18) 
The scribes and chief priests heard this and began looking for a way to kill Him, for they were afraid of Him, because all the people were amazed by His teaching.

(Mark 11:19) 
When evening came, He went out of the city.

(Mark 11:20) 
And as they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.

(Mark 11:21) 
Then Peter, remembering, said to Him: “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has dried up.”

(Mark 11:22) 
And Jesus answered, saying to them: “Have faith in God.”

(Mark 11:23) 
“Truly, I say to you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.

(Mark 11:24) 
“Therefore I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

(Mark 11:25) 
“And whenever you stand praying, forgive anything you have against anyone, so that your Father in the universe may also forgive you your sins.”

(Mark 11:26) 
“But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the universe forgive your sins.”

(Mark 11:27) 
And again they came to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him,

(Mark 11:28) 
and they were saying to Him: “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?”

(Mark 11:29) 
Jesus answered them, “I will ask you one question, and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

(Mark 11:30) 
“Was the baptism of John from the universe, or from men? Answer Me.”

(Mark 11:31) 
And they were reasoning among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From the universe,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’”

(Mark 11:32) 
“But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people, for they all consider John to have been a true prophet.”

(Mark 11:33) 
So they answered Jesus, saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus answered them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Mark 12:1) 
And He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it, and dug a pit, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers, and went away on a journey.

(Mark 12:2) 
And when the harvest season came, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect the fruit of the vineyard.

(Mark 12:3) 
And seizing the servant, they beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

(Mark 12:4) 
And he sent to them again another servant, and him they wounded in the head, and treated shamefully.

(Mark 12:5) 
Then he sent another one, and him they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat, and some they killed.

(Mark 12:6) 
He still had one beloved son. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, ‘Surely they will respect my son.’

(Mark 12:7) 
But those farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’

(Mark 12:8) 
And seizing him, they killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

(Mark 12:9) 
What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.

(Mark 12:10) 
Have you not read this scripture: ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.

(Mark 12:11) 
This was done by the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes’?

(Mark 12:12) 
And they sought to seize Him, but they feared the crowds, for they knew that He had spoken the parable to them. And leaving Him, they went away.

(Mark 12:13) 
And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch Him in His speech.

(Mark 12:14) 
And when they were come, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and care for no one; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or shall we not pay?”

(Mark 12:15) 
But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why are you tempting me? Bring me a denarius that I may see it.”

(Mark 12:16) 
And they brought it. And He said to them, “Whose is this image and inscription?” They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”

(Mark 12:17) 
And Jesus answering, said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were astonished at Him.

(Mark 12:18) 
And there came to Him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they were questioning Him, saying:

(Mark 12:19) 
“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for his brother.

(Mark 12:20) 
There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and died without leaving children.

(Mark 12:21) 
And the second took her, and died, and neither did he leave children. And the third in like manner.

(Mark 12:22) 
And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all, the woman died also.

(Mark 12:23) 
In the resurrection, therefore, when they rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”

(Mark 12:24) 
And Jesus answering, said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

(Mark 12:25) 
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in the heavens.

(Mark 12:26) 
And as for the dead, that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying:

(Mark 12:27) 
‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you are much mistaken.”

(Mark 12:28) 
And one of the scribes, who had heard them disputing, and seeing that He had answered them well, asked Him: “Which commandment is the first of all?”

(Mark 12:29) 
And Jesus answered him: “The first is: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

(Mark 12:30) 
‘And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment.

(Mark 12:31) 
And the second is like this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

(Mark 12:32) 
And the scribe said to Him: “Well, Teacher, you have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but Him:

(Mark 12:33) 
‘And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is greater than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

(Mark 12:34) 
And Jesus, seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to question Him anymore.

(Mark 12:35) 
And Jesus, answering, said, while teaching in the temple: “How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?

(Mark 12:36) 
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.’

(Mark 12:37) 
David himself calls Him ‘Lord.’ How is He then his son?”

(Mark 12:38) 
And the great multitude listened to Him with pleasure.

(Mark 12:39) 
And in His teaching He was saying: “Beware of the scribes, who wish to walk in long robes, and to be greeted in the marketplace,

(Mark 12:40) 
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts.

(Mark 12:41) 
They devour the houses of widows under the guise of long prayers. These will receive a more severe judgment.”

(Mark 12:42) 
And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched how the crowd was casting money into the treasury. And many rich people were throwing in much.

(Mark 12:43) 
And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a farthing.

(Mark 12:44) 
And calling His disciples to Him, He said to them: “Amen I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who have cast into the treasury.

(Mark 12:45) 
For they all put in out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in all that she had, even her whole living.”

(Mark 13:1) 
As He left the temple, one of His disciples said, “Teacher, look at the enormous stones and impressive buildings!”

(Mark 13:2) 
Jesus answered, “Do you see these great buildings? Not a stone will be left upon a stone; all will be torn down.”

(Mark 13:3) 
As He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately:

(Mark 13:4) 
“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to be fulfilled?”

(Mark 13:5) 
Jesus began to say to them: “Be careful that no one deceives you.

(Mark 13:6) 
For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and they will deceive many.

(Mark 13:7) 
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; for such things must happen, but the end is not yet.

(Mark 13:8) 
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pangs.

(Mark 13:9) 
“But be careful yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.

(Mark 13:10) 
And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.

(Mark 13:11) 
And when they deliver you and bring you to trial, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you at that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

(Mark 13:12) 
And brother will deliver brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.

(Mark 13:13) 
And you will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.

(Mark 13:14) 
“But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

(Mark 13:15) 
Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter the house to take anything out.

(Mark 13:16) 
And let the one who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak.

(Mark 13:17) 
“But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!

(Mark 13:18) 
Pray that it may not happen in the winter.

(Mark 13:19) 
“For those days will be a time of tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will occur.

(Mark 13:20) 
“And unless the Lord shortened those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.

(Mark 13:21) 
“And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘Behold, He is there,’ do not believe it.

(Mark 13:22) 
For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.

(Mark 13:23) 
“But be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand.

(Mark 13:24) 
“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,

(Mark 13:25) 
and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

(Mark 13:26) 
“And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.

(Mark 13:27) 
“And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.

(Mark 13:28) 
“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.

(Mark 13:29) 
“So also you, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the doors.

(Mark 13:30) 
“Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.

(Mark 13:31) 
“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

(Mark 13:32) 
“But of that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.

(Mark 13:33) 
“Be on the alert, keep awake, and pray; for you do not know when the time will come.

(Mark 13:34) 
“It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his servants in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay awake.

(Mark 13:35) 
“Therefore, be on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at the rooster’s crowing, or in the morning—

(Mark 13:36) 
lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.

(Mark 13:37) 
“What I say to you I say to all: ‘Be on the alert!’”

(Mark 14:1) 
The Passover and Unleavened Bread were coming in two days. The chief priests and scribes sought how to seize Jesus by treachery and kill Him.

(Mark 14:2) 
They said, “Not during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”

(Mark 14:3) 
Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, and as He reclined at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of very costly ointment of pure nard. Breaking the flask, she poured the ointment over His head.

(Mark 14:4) 
Some were indignant within themselves and said, “Why was this waste of ointment made?

(Mark 14:5) 
It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they were angry at her.

(Mark 14:6) 
Jesus said, “Let her alone! Why do you bother her? She has done a good work for Me.

(Mark 14:7) 
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them. But you do not always have Me.

(Mark 14:8) 
She has done what she could; she has beforehand anointed My body for burial.

(Mark 14:9) 
Amen, I say to you, wherever the Gospel is proclaimed throughout the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”

(Mark 14:10) 
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to hand Jesus over to them.

(Mark 14:11) 
They were pleased when they heard this and promised to give him money. And he sought how to betray Him at a convenient time.

(Mark 14:12) 
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, His disciples said to Him, “Where do you want us to go to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”

(Mark 14:13) 
He sent two of His disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.

(Mark 14:14) 
Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’

(Mark 14:15) 
Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Prepare for us there.”

(Mark 14:16) 
The disciples went out and came to the city and found everything as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Mark 14:17) 
When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.

(Mark 14:18) 
As they reclined and were eating, Jesus said, “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray Me, the one eating with Me.”

(Mark 14:19) 
They began to be sorrowful and to say to Him one by one, “Surely not I?”

(Mark 14:20) 
He said to them in reply, “One of the Twelve, the one who dips his hand into the dish with Me.

(Mark 14:21) 
The Son of Man goes as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”

(Mark 14:22) 
While they were eating, He took bread, said the blessing, broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take this, this is My body.”

(Mark 14:23) 
Then He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.

(Mark 14:24) 
He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many.

(Mark 14:25) 
Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”

(Mark 14:26) 
Then, after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

(Mark 14:27) 
Jesus said to them, “You will all have your faith shaken, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’

(Mark 14:28) 
But after I am raised up, I shall go before you to Galilee.”

(Mark 14:29) 
Peter said to Him, “Even though all should have their faith shaken, I will not.”

(Mark 14:30) 
Jesus said to him, “Amen, I say to you, this very night before the cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”

(Mark 14:31) 
But he vehemently protested, “Even though I should have to die with You, I will not deny You.” And they all spoke similarly.

(Mark 14:32) 
They came to a place named Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”

(Mark 14:33) 
He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be troubled and distressed.

(Mark 14:34) 
He said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch.”

(Mark 14:35) 
He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him.

(Mark 14:36) 
He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to You. Take this cup away from Me, but not what I will, but what You will.”

(Mark 14:37) 
Then He returned and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?

(Mark 14:38) 
Keep watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

(Mark 14:39) 
Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.

(Mark 14:40) 
Again He returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what to answer Him.

(Mark 14:41) 
He returned a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is over. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.

(Mark 14:42) 
Get up, let us go. See, My betrayer is near.”

(Mark 14:43) 
Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.

(Mark 14:44) 
The one who was to hand Him over had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I shall kiss is the one; seize him and lead him away securely.”

(Mark 14:45) 
And when he came, he immediately went up to Him and said, “Rabbi,” and kissed Him.

(Mark 14:46) 
Then they laid hands on Him.

(Mark 14:47) 
One of the bystanders drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

(Mark 14:48) 
Jesus said to them in reply, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to seize Me?

(Mark 14:49) 
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest Me; but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.”

(Mark 14:50) 
And they all left Him and fled.

(Mark 14:51) 
Now a young man followed Him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They tried to seize him,

(Mark 14:52) 
but he left the linen cloth behind and ran off naked.

(Mark 14:53) 
They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.

(Mark 14:54) 
Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the high priest's courtyard, where he sat with the guards and warmed himself by the fire.

(Mark 14:55) 
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus so they could put Him to death, but they found none.

(Mark 14:56) 
Many gave false testimony against Him, but their testimonies did not agree.

(Mark 14:57) 
Some began to give false testimony against Him, saying,

(Mark 14:58) 
“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.’”

(Mark 14:59) 
But not even so did their testimony agree.

(Mark 14:60) 
The high priest rose before them and questioned Jesus, saying, “Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?”

(Mark 14:61) 
But He remained silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”

(Mark 14:62) 
Jesus said, “I AM; and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of the sky.”

(Mark 14:63) 
The high priest tore his garments and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?

(Mark 14:64) 
You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned Him as deserving to die.

(Mark 14:65) 
Some began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him and began to beat Him, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!”

(Mark 14:66) 
The guards also took Him and beat Him.

(Mark 14:67) 
While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s maids came.

(Mark 14:68) 
Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You too were with Jesus of Nazareth.”

(Mark 14:69) 
But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” And he went out to the forecourt, and the cock crowed.

(Mark 14:70) 
The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”

(Mark 14:71) 
He again denied it. After a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.”

(Mark 14:72) 
He began to curse and to swear, “I do not know this man about whom you are speaking.”

(Mark 14:73) 
Immediately the cock crowed a second time. Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.

(Mark 15:1) 
Early in the morning, the high priests, elders, scribes, and the entire council made a plan. They bound Jesus, brought Him, and handed Him over to Pilate.

(Mark 15:2) 
Pilate questioned Him, asking: “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied: “You say so.”

(Mark 15:3) 
And many accused Him of many things.

(Mark 15:4) 
Pilate questioned Him again, saying: “Won’t you answer? See how many things they are accusing you of?”

(Mark 15:5) 
But Jesus still did not reply, so Pilate was amazed.

(Mark 15:6) 
Now, it was customary for him to release one prisoner at the feast, whomever they requested.

(Mark 15:7) 
There was a man called Barabbas, who was imprisoned with those who had started a revolt and committed murder during the revolt.

(Mark 15:8) 
The crowd then came up and began to request that he do for them what he always did.

(Mark 15:9) 
Pilate answered them, saying: “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”

(Mark 15:10) 
For he knew that the high priests had handed Him over out of envy.

(Mark 15:11) 
The high priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas for them instead.

(Mark 15:12) 
Pilate answered them again, saying: “Then what do you want me to do with the king of the Jews?”

(Mark 15:13) 
They shouted back: “Crucify him!”

(Mark 15:14) 
Pilate said to them: “Why, what wrong has he done?” But they shouted all the louder: “Crucify him!”

(Mark 15:15) 
Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them and handed Jesus over to be scourged and crucified.

(Mark 15:16) 
The soldiers then brought Him into the courtyard, that is, the praetorium, and called together the entire cohort.

(Mark 15:17) 
They put a purple cloak on Him, and twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on Him.

(Mark 15:18) 
Then they began to salute Him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”

(Mark 15:19) 
And they struck Him on the head with a reed. They spat on Him, and bowing their knees, they worshipped Him.

(Mark 15:20) 
After mocking Him, they took the purple cloak off Him and put His own clothes back on. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.

(Mark 15:21) 
They compelled a certain passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry His cross.

(Mark 15:22) 
They brought Him to the place Golgotha, which means, the place of the skull.

(Mark 15:23) 
They offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He didn’t take it.

(Mark 15:24) 
And they crucified Him, and divided His garments among them, casting lots for them to see what each one would take.

(Mark 15:25) 
It was the third hour when they crucified Him.

(Mark 15:26) 
The inscription of the charge against Him was written: “The King of the Jews.”

(Mark 15:27) 
With Him, they crucified two thieves, one on His right and the other on His left.

(Mark 15:28) 
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And he was counted among the wicked.”

(Mark 15:29) 
Those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,

(Mark 15:30) 
save yourself by coming down from the cross!”

(Mark 15:31) 
In the same way, the high priests mocked Him among themselves with the scribes, saying, “He saved others; He can’t save Himself.”

(Mark 15:32) 
“Let Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe.” Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.

(Mark 15:33) 
When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole earth until the ninth hour.

(Mark 15:34) 
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”

(Mark 15:35) 
Some of the bystanders, hearing this, said: “Look, he’s calling for Elijah.”

(Mark 15:36) 
Someone ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, “Wait! Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”

(Mark 15:37) 
Then Jesus, uttering a loud cry, breathed His last.

(Mark 15:38) 
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

(Mark 15:39) 
When the centurion who stood facing Him saw that He had breathed His last in this way, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.”

(Mark 15:40) 
There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.

(Mark 15:41) 
They had followed Him when He was in Galilee, ministering to Him, and there were many other women who had come up with Him to Jerusalem.

(Mark 15:42) 
When evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,

(Mark 15:43) 
Joseph of Arimathaea, a respected member of the council, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.

(Mark 15:44) 
Pilate was surprised that He was already dead, and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He was already dead.

(Mark 15:45) 
When he learned this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

(Mark 15:46) 
Having bought a linen shroud, Joseph took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

(Mark 15:47) 
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on where He was laid.

(Mark 16:1) 
After the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought perfumed oils, so that when they came to the tomb, they could anoint Jesus.

(Mark 16:2) 
And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb. The sun had just risen.

(Mark 16:3) 
And they were saying to one another: "Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?"

(Mark 16:4) 
But looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was very large.

(Mark 16:5) 
And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a white robe, and they were astonished.

(Mark 16:6) 
The young man said to them: "Do not be terrified. You are seeking Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.

(Mark 16:7) 
But go, tell His disciples and Peter, that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you."

(Mark 16:8) 
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and fear had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

(Mark 16:9) 
Now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.

(Mark 16:10) 
She went and announced the news to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.

(Mark 16:11) 
And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.

(Mark 16:12) 
After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking to the country.

(Mark 16:13) 
And they went and told the others, and they did not believe them.

(Mark 16:14) 
Finally, as they were reclining at table, He appeared to the eleven. And He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen.

(Mark 16:15) 
And He said to them: "Go into the entire world and preach the Gospel to every creature.

(Mark 16:16) 
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

(Mark 16:17) 
And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;

(Mark 16:18) 
they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."

(Mark 16:19) 
So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into the sky and sat at the right hand of God.

(Mark 16:20) 
And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.

(Luke 1:1) 
Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,

(Luke 1:2) 
as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.

(Luke 1:3) 
Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,

(Luke 1:4) 
so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.

(Luke 1:5) 
In the time of Herod king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and his wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

(Luke 1:6) 
Both of them were righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.

(Luke 1:7) 
But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.

(Luke 1:8) 
Once when Zechariah was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,

(Luke 1:9) 
according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

(Luke 1:10) 
And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.

(Luke 1:11) 
Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

(Luke 1:12) 
When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.

(Luke 1:13) 
But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.

(Luke 1:14) 
And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,

(Luke 1:15) 
because he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.

(Luke 1:16) 
And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.

(Luke 1:17) 
And he will go on before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of parents to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”

(Luke 1:18) 
And Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”

(Luke 1:19) 
And the angel answering said to him: “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you this good news.

(Luke 1:20) 
And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”

(Luke 1:21) 
And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.

(Luke 1:22) 
When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute.

(Luke 1:23) 
And it came to pass that, as soon as the days of his service were completed, he departed to his own house.

(Luke 1:24) 
After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,

(Luke 1:25) 
“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.”

(Luke 1:26) 
In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,

(Luke 1:27) 
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

(Luke 1:28) 
And the angel came to her and said, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you.” Blessed are you among women.

(Luke 1:29) 
But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what sort of greeting this might be.

(Luke 1:30) 
Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

(Luke 1:31) 
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus.

(Luke 1:32) 
He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David,

(Luke 1:33) 
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”

(Luke 1:34) 
And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I do not know a man?”

(Luke 1:35) 
And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy—he will be called the Son of God.

(Luke 1:36) 
And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.

(Luke 1:37) 
For nothing will be impossible with God.”

(Luke 1:38) 
And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

(Luke 1:39) 
In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,

(Luke 1:40) 
and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.

(Luke 1:41) 
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

(Luke 1:42) 
and she cried out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

(Luke 1:43) 
And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

(Luke 1:44) 
For behold, as soon as the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.

(Luke 1:45) 
And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

(Luke 1:46) 
And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,

(Luke 1:47) 
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,

(Luke 1:48) 
for He has looked on the humble estate of His servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;

(Luke 1:49) 
for He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.

(Luke 1:50) 
And His mercy is for those who fear Him from generation to generation.

(Luke 1:51) 
He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,

(Luke 1:52) 
He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and has exalted those of humble estate;

(Luke 1:53) 
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.

(Luke 1:54) 
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,

(Luke 1:55) 
as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”

(Luke 1:56) 
And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.

(Luke 1:57) 
Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.

(Luke 1:58) 
And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.

(Luke 1:59) 
And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him by the name of his father Zechariah,

(Luke 1:60) 
and his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.”

(Luke 1:61) 
And they said to her, “But there is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”

(Luke 1:62) 
And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called.

(Luke 1:63) 
And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all marveled.

(Luke 1:64) 
And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.

(Luke 1:65) 
And fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.

(Luke 1:66) 
And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.

(Luke 1:67) 
And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

(Luke 1:68) 
“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people

(Luke 1:69) 
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,

(Luke 1:70) 
as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old,

(Luke 1:71) 
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;

(Luke 1:72) 
to show mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,

(Luke 1:73) 
the oath that He swore to our father Abraham, to grant us

(Luke 1:74) 
that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,

(Luke 1:75) 
in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.

(Luke 1:76) 
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,

(Luke 1:77) 
to give knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness of their sins,

(Luke 1:78) 
because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high

(Luke 1:79) 
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”

(Luke 1:80) 
And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his appearing to Israel.

(Luke 2:1) 
In those days, Caesar Augustus gave a decree for a census to be taken of the entire world.

(Luke 2:2) 
This first census took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

(Luke 2:3) 
And everyone went to be registered, each person to their own city.

(Luke 2:4) 
So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David, called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,

(Luke 2:5) 
to be registered with Mary, his espoused wife, who was pregnant.

(Luke 2:6) 
And it came to pass that, while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth.

(Luke 2:7) 
She brought forth her firstborn Son, wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

(Luke 2:8) 
And there were shepherds in the same region, keeping watch and guarding the night over their flock.

(Luke 2:9) 
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to them, and the glory of God shone round about them, and they were greatly afraid.

(Luke 2:10) 
Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:

(Luke 2:11) 
For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

(Luke 2:12) 
And this is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.”

(Luke 2:13) 
And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

(Luke 2:14) 
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those He favors.”

(Luke 2:15) 
And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”

(Luke 2:16) 
And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

(Luke 2:17) 
When they had seen, they made known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.

(Luke 2:18) 
And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.

(Luke 2:19) 
But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.

(Luke 2:20) 
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it was told them.

(Luke 2:21) 
And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising the Child, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

(Luke 2:22) 
And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord,

(Luke 2:23) 
(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord,”)

(Luke 2:24) 
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”

(Luke 2:25) 
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

(Luke 2:26) 
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

(Luke 2:27) 
And he came in the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for Him according to the custom of the Law,

(Luke 2:28) 
he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:

(Luke 2:29) 
“Now, Lord, You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;

(Luke 2:30) 
For my eyes have seen Your salvation

(Luke 2:31) 
Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,

(Luke 2:32) 
A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.”

(Luke 2:33) 
And his father and mother were marveling at the things spoken concerning Him.

(Luke 2:34) 
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against

(Luke 2:35) 
and a sword will pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

(Luke 2:36) 
And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,

(Luke 2:37) 
and then as a widow until she was eighty-four years old. She did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.

(Luke 2:38) 
And coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to God and spoke of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

(Luke 2:39) 
And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.

(Luke 2:40) 
And the Child continued to grow and become strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon Him.

(Luke 2:41) 
Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.

(Luke 2:42) 
And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast,

(Luke 2:43) 
and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, but His parents did not know it.

(Luke 2:44) 
Assuming Him to be in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.

(Luke 2:45) 
When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for Him.

(Luke 2:46) 
After three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.

(Luke 2:47) 
And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.

(Luke 2:48) 
When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You.”

(Luke 2:49) 
And He said to them, “Why were you looking for Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?”

(Luke 2:50) 
But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.

(Luke 2:51) 
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, and His mother kept all these things in her heart.

(Luke 2:52) 
And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

(Luke 3:1) 
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,

(Luke 3:2) 
during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the desert.

(Luke 3:3) 
And he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

(Luke 3:4) 
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "The voice of one crying in the desert: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'

(Luke 3:5) 
'Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth.'

(Luke 3:6) 
'And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'

(Luke 3:7) 
He therefore said to the crowds that went out to be baptized by him: "Offspring of vipers, who has shown you how to flee from the wrath to come?

(Luke 3:8) 
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and do not begin to say, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I tell you that God is able, even from these stones, to raise up children to Abraham.

(Luke 3:9) 
For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Luke 3:10) 
And the crowds were questioning him, saying: "What then should we do?

(Luke 3:11) 
And he answering, said to them: "He that has two coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do in like manner.

(Luke 3:12) 
And the publicans also came to be baptized; and they said to him: "Master, what shall we do?

(Luke 3:13) 
But he said to them: "Do nothing more than that which is appointed to you.

(Luke 3:14) 
And the soldiers also questioned him, saying: "And we, what shall we do?" And he said to them: "Do violence to no one, nor accuse anyone falsely; and be content with your pay.

(Luke 3:15) 
Now as the people were in expectation, and all were thinking in their hearts of John, if perhaps he were Christ,

(Luke 3:16) 
John, answering, said to them all: "I indeed baptize you with water; but there shall come one mightier than I, the strap of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

(Luke 3:17) 
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

(Luke 3:18) 
And many other things, exhorting, he preached to the people.

(Luke 3:19) 
But Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evils that Herod had done,

(Luke 3:20) 
added this also above all, and shut up John in prison.

(Luke 3:21) 
Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened;

(Luke 3:22) 
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him; and a voice came from heaven: "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

(Luke 3:23) 
And Jesus himself was beginning about thirty years old, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was of Heli,

(Luke 3:24) 
who was of Matthath, who was of Levi, who was of Melchi, who was of Janna, who was of Joseph,

(Luke 3:25) 
who was of Mattathias, who was of Amos, who was of Nahum, who was of Esli, who was of Naggae,

(Luke 3:26) 
who was of Maath, who was of Mattathias, who was of Semei, who was of Josech, who was of Joda,

(Luke 3:27) 
who was of Joannan, who was of Rhesa, who was of Zorobabel, who was of Salaathiel, who was of Neri,

(Luke 3:28) 
who was of Melchi, who was of Addi, who was of Chosam, who was of Elmodam, who was of Her,

(Luke 3:29) 
who was of Jose, who was of Eliezer, who was of Jorim, who was of Matthath, who was of Levi,

(Luke 3:30) 
who was of Simeon, who was of Juda, who was of Joseph, who was of Jona, who was of Eliachim,

(Luke 3:31) 
who was of Melea, who was of Menna, who was of Matthata, who was of Nathan, who was of David,

(Luke 3:32) 
who was of Isai, who was of Obed, who was of Booz, who was of Sela, who was of Aram,

(Luke 3:33) 
who was of Aminadab, who was of Admin, who was of Arni, who was of Esrom, who was of Phares, who was of Juda,

(Luke 3:34) 
who was of Jacob, who was of Isaac, who was of Abraham, who was of Thare, who was of Nachor,

(Luke 3:35) 
who was of Seruch, who was of Ragau, who was of Phalec, who was of Heber, who was of Sale,

(Luke 3:36) 
who was of Cainan, who was of Arphaxad, who was of Sem, who was of Noe, who was of Lamech,

(Luke 3:37) 
who was of Matusala, who was of Enoch, who was of Jared, who was of Malaleel, who was of Cainan,

(Luke 3:38) 
who was of Enos, who was of Seth, who was of Adam, who was of God.

(Luke 4:1) 
Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desert.

(Luke 4:2) 
There, He was tested by the Devil for forty days. And during those days, He ate nothing. When those days were over, He was hungry.

(Luke 4:3) 
The Devil said to Him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."

(Luke 4:4) 
Jesus answered him, "It is written: ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’"

(Luke 4:5) 
Then the Devil led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.

(Luke 4:6) 
And the Devil said to Him, "To you I will give all this power and their glory, because it has been given to me, and I give it to whomever I wish."

(Luke 4:7) 
If you worship me, then all shall be yours."

(Luke 4:8) 
Jesus answered him, "It is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.’"

(Luke 4:9) 
Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and placed Him on the highest part of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;

(Luke 4:10) 
for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you;’

(Luke 4:11) 
and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.’"

(Luke 4:12) 
And Jesus answering, said to him, "It is said: ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’"

(Luke 4:13) 
When the Devil had finished every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.

(Luke 4:14) 
Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about Him went out through all the surrounding region.

(Luke 4:15) 
And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

(Luke 4:16) 
He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And, as was His custom, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.

(Luke 4:17) 
And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. When He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:

(Luke 4:18) 
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,

(Luke 4:19) 
to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

(Luke 4:20) 
Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all those in the synagogue were fixed on Him.

(Luke 4:21) 
And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”

(Luke 4:22) 
And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the gracious words that proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, “Is this not the son of Joseph?”

(Luke 4:23) 
And He said to them, "You will surely quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.’"

(Luke 4:24) 
And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.

(Luke 4:25) 
But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, and when great famine was throughout all the land;

(Luke 4:26) 
and Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.

(Luke 4:27) 
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."

(Luke 4:28) 
And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath.

(Luke 4:29) 
Then they rose up and thrust Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw Him down headlong.

(Luke 4:30) 
But He, passing through their midst, went His way.

(Luke 4:31) 
Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.

(Luke 4:32) 
And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.

(Luke 4:33) 
Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,

(Luke 4:34) 
saying, “Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are—the Holy One of God!”

(Luke 4:35) 
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out of him, without hurting him.

(Luke 4:36) 
Then they were all amazed, and they spoke among themselves, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.”

(Luke 4:37) 
And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.

(Luke 4:38) 
Then He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s wife’s mother was ill with a high fever, and they made request of Him concerning her.

(Luke 4:39) 
So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.

(Luke 4:40) 
When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him. And He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.

(Luke 4:41) 
And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.

(Luke 4:42) 
Now when day came, He departed and went into a desolate place. And the crowds were looking for Him, and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from going away from them;

(Luke 4:43) 
but He said to them, “I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this reason I have been sent."

(Luke 4:44) 
And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

(Luke 5:1) 
It came to pass that when the crowds pressed in on Him, wanting to hear the Word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.

(Luke 5:2) 
He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.

(Luke 5:3) 
And He, entering into one of the boats, which was Simon's, asked him to move the boat a little from the land. And, sitting down, He taught the crowds from the boat.

(Luke 5:4) 
When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”

(Luke 5:5) 
And Simon answering, said to Him: “Master, we have toiled all night and taken nothing; but at your word, I will let down the net.”

(Luke 5:6) 
And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish, and their nets were breaking.

(Luke 5:7) 
And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they were almost sinking.

(Luke 5:8) 
Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying: “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.”

(Luke 5:9) 
For he was astonished, and all who were with him, at the catch of the fish that they had taken.

(Luke 5:10) 
And so also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men.”

(Luke 5:11) 
And when they had brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.

(Luke 5:12) 
And it came to pass that when He was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy; and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and besought Him, saying: “Lord, if You will, You can make me clean.”

(Luke 5:13) 
And extending His hand, He touched him, saying: “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him.

(Luke 5:14) 
And He charged him to tell no one, but “Go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”

(Luke 5:15) 
But so much the more the report about Him spread, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.

(Luke 5:16) 
But He was withdrawing to the deserts and praying.

(Luke 5:17) 
And it came to pass on one of those days, that He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

(Luke 5:18) 
And behold, men were carrying a man on a bed who was paralyzed; and they were seeking to bring him in and to set him before Him.

(Luke 5:19) 
And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went upon the housetop, and let him down with the bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.

(Luke 5:20) 
When He saw their faith, He said: “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”

(Luke 5:21) 
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying: “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”

(Luke 5:22) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, answering, said to them: “What do you question in your hearts?

(Luke 5:23) 
Which is easier, to say: ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say: ‘Rise and walk’?

(Luke 5:24) 
But that you may know that the Son of Man has the power on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic: “I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”

(Luke 5:25) 
And immediately rising up before them, and taking up the bed on which he was lying, he went to his own house, glorifying God.

(Luke 5:26) 
And amazement took hold of all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying: “We have seen wonderful things today.”

(Luke 5:27) 
And after these things, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and He said to him: “Follow Me.”

(Luke 5:28) 
And leaving everything, he arose and followed Him.

(Luke 5:29) 
And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.

(Luke 5:30) 
And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against His disciples, saying: “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”

(Luke 5:31) 
And Jesus answering, said to them: “Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick.”

(Luke 5:32) 
“I have not come to call the just, but sinners to repentance.”

(Luke 5:33) 
And they said to Him: “The disciples of John fast often and make supplications; likewise, the Pharisees do; but Yours eat and drink.”

(Luke 5:34) 
To whom Jesus said: “Can you make the sons of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?

(Luke 5:35) 
“But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.”

(Luke 5:36) 
He spoke also a parable to them: “No one puts a piece from a new garment onto an old garment; otherwise, the new will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.”

(Luke 5:37) 
“And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.

(Luke 5:38) 
“But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins; then both are preserved.”

(Luke 5:39) 
And no one, drinking the old, wants the new immediately; for he says, ‘The old is better.’”

(Luke 6:1) 
One Sabbath day, Jesus went out through a field of grain. His disciples began to pluck some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.

(Luke 6:2) 
Some Pharisees said, “Why are you doing things that are not allowed on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 6:3) 
Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read about how David and those who were with him did when they were hungry?

(Luke 6:4) 
He went into God’s house, and took the bread offered to God, and ate it, and gave it to his companions. He was not permitted to eat this bread because it was only for the priests.

(Luke 6:5) 
Then He told them, “The Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.”

(Luke 6:6) 
On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach. There was a man there whose right hand was shriveled.

(Luke 6:7) 
The scribes and the Pharisees watched Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so they could accuse Him.

(Luke 6:8) 
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in the middle.” He got up and stood there.

(Luke 6:9) 
Jesus then said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to destroy it?”

(Luke 6:10) 
Then He looked around at everyone. He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored.

(Luke 6:11) 
But they were filled with rage, and began to talk about what they should do to Jesus.

(Luke 6:12) 
In these days, Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God.

(Luke 6:13) 
When the sun rose, He called His disciples and chose twelve of them, whom He also named Apostles.

(Luke 6:14) 
Simon, whom He named Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

(Luke 6:15) 
Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who is called the Zealot,

(Luke 6:16) 
Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was a traitor.

(Luke 6:17) 
He came down with them and stood on a level place, and a large crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.

(Luke 6:18) 
They had come to hear Him and be healed of their diseases. Those tormented by evil spirits were cured.

(Luke 6:19) 
And all the crowd were trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him that was healing everyone.

(Luke 6:20) 
Then Jesus looked at His disciples and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, because yours is the kingdom of God.

(Luke 6:21) 
Blessed are you who hunger now, because you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, because you will laugh.

(Luke 6:22) 
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you, and reject your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man.

(Luke 6:23) 
Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, because your reward is great in the universe. Their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.

(Luke 6:24) 
But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your consolation.

(Luke 6:25) 
Woe to you who are full now, because you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep.

(Luke 6:26) 
Woe to you when all speak well of you, for their ancestors treated the false prophets in the same way.

(Luke 6:27) 
But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you.

(Luke 6:28) 
Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.

(Luke 6:29) 
To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also. From the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.

(Luke 6:30) 
Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your belongings back from the one who takes them away.

(Luke 6:31) 
And as you want people to do to you, do the same to them.

(Luke 6:32) 
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.

(Luke 6:33) 
If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.

(Luke 6:34) 
And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount.

(Luke 6:35) 
But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, for He is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.

(Luke 6:36) 
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

(Luke 6:37) 
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

(Luke 6:38) 
Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”

(Luke 6:39) 
He also told them this parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?

(Luke 6:40) 
A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

(Luke 6:41) 
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?

(Luke 6:42) 
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first remove the log from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye.

(Luke 6:43) 
For no good tree produces bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.

(Luke 6:44) 
Each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.

(Luke 6:45) 
The good person brings forth good things from the good treasury of his heart, and the evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasury. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

(Luke 6:46) 
“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

(Luke 6:47) 
I will show you what someone is like who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them.

(Luke 6:48) 
That person is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. When a flood came, the river beat against that house, but it could not shake it, because it was well built.

(Luke 6:49) 
But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river beat against it, the house immediately fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”

(Luke 7:1) 
When Jesus finished speaking to the people, he went into Capernaum.

(Luke 7:2) 
A centurion's servant was very ill and near death—he was very dear to the centurion.

(Luke 7:3) 
When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to beg him to come and heal his servant.

(Luke 7:4) 
When they came to Jesus, they earnestly pleaded with him, saying, “This man deserves your help,

(Luke 7:5) 
because he loves our people, and he built our synagogue.”

(Luke 7:6) 
So Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter my home,

(Luke 7:7) 
and that is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. Just give the order, and my servant will be healed.

(Luke 7:8) 
For I myself am a man subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

(Luke 7:9) 
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to the crowd following him, “I tell you, I have not found such faith even in Israel.”

(Luke 7:10) 
And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.

(Luke 7:11) 
Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.

(Luke 7:12) 
As he approached the gate of the town, a dead man was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her.

(Luke 7:13) 
When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her, and he said, “Do not weep.”

(Luke 7:14) 
Then he went up and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”

(Luke 7:15) 
The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.

(Luke 7:16) 
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and, “God has come to help his people.”

(Luke 7:17) 
This news about him spread throughout Judea and the surrounding area.

(Luke 7:18) 
John’s disciples told him about all these things.

(Luke 7:19) 
Calling two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”

(Luke 7:20) 
When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”

(Luke 7:21) 
At that very time Jesus cured many who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons; and he granted sight to many who were blind.

(Luke 7:22) 
So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.

(Luke 7:23) 
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”

(Luke 7:24) 
After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

(Luke 7:25) 
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in royal palaces.

(Luke 7:26) 
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

(Luke 7:27) 
This is the one about whom it is written: ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’

(Luke 7:28) 
I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”

(Luke 7:29) 
All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard this, acknowledged that God was in the right, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.

(Luke 7:30) 
But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.

(Luke 7:31) 
To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?

(Luke 7:32) 
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’

(Luke 7:33) 
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’

(Luke 7:34) 
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’

(Luke 7:35) 
But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”

(Luke 7:36) 
Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.

(Luke 7:37) 
A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came with a jar of expensive perfume.

(Luke 7:38) 
As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.

(Luke 7:39) 
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”

(Luke 7:40) 
Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, teacher,” he said.

(Luke 7:41) 
“Two people owed money to a certain money lender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

(Luke 7:42) 
Neither of them could pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”

(Luke 7:43) 
Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.

(Luke 7:44) 
Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

(Luke 7:45) 
You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.

(Luke 7:46) 
You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.

(Luke 7:47) 
Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”

(Luke 7:48) 
Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

(Luke 7:49) 
The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

(Luke 7:50) 
Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”

(Luke 8:1) 
After this, Jesus Christ traveled through the cities and villages, preaching and proclaiming the Kingdom of God; and the twelve apostles were with Him,

(Luke 8:2) 
and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

(Luke 8:3) 
and Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them from their resources.

(Luke 8:4) 
And when a very large crowd was gathering, and people were coming to Him from every city, He said this parable:

(Luke 8:5) 
“A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell beside the way and was trodden down, and the birds of the sky ate it up.

(Luke 8:6) 
“And some fell on the rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it had no moisture.

(Luke 8:7) 
“And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.

(Luke 8:8) 
“And some fell on the good ground, and sprang up, and produced a hundredfold.” As He said these things, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Luke 8:9) 
Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant.

(Luke 8:10) 
And He said, “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to the rest, it is in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

(Luke 8:11) 
“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

(Luke 8:12) 
“Those by the way are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.

(Luke 8:13) 
“Those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.

(Luke 8:14) 
“And what fell among the thorns are those who have heard, and as they go, are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit.

(Luke 8:15) 
“But what fell on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, having heard the word, keep it and bear fruit with patience.

(Luke 8:16) 
“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

(Luke 8:17) 
“For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.

(Luke 8:18) 
“Take heed therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”

(Luke 8:19) 
Then His mother and brothers came to Him, but they could not get to Him because of the crowd.

(Luke 8:20) 
And it was told Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.”

(Luke 8:21) 
But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”

(Luke 8:22) 
Now it happened on a certain day that He got into a boat with His disciples, and He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they launched out.

(Luke 8:23) 
But as they sailed, He fell asleep; and a tempest of wind descended on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.

(Luke 8:24) 
And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.

(Luke 8:25) 
But He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they, afraid, marveled, saying to one another, “Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!”

(Luke 8:26) 
Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.

(Luke 8:27) 
And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. He was not wearing clothes, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.

(Luke 8:28) 
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!”

(Luke 8:29) 
For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the wilderness.

(Luke 8:30) 
Jesus asked him, saying, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him.

(Luke 8:31) 
And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.

(Luke 8:32) 
Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.

(Luke 8:33) 
Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and were drowned.

(Luke 8:34) 
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.

(Luke 8:35) 
Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.

(Luke 8:36) 
And those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.

(Luke 8:37) 
Then the whole multitude of the region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into a boat and returned.

(Luke 8:38) 
Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

(Luke 8:39) 
“Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.” And he went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.

(Luke 8:40) 
Now it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.

(Luke 8:41) 
And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to come to his house,

(Luke 8:42) 
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him.

(Luke 8:43) 
Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by anyone,

(Luke 8:44) 
came behind Him and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.

(Luke 8:45) 
And Jesus said, “Who touched Me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’

(Luke 8:46) 
But Jesus said, “Someone touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.”

(Luke 8:47) 
Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.

(Luke 8:48) 
And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”

(Luke 8:49) 
While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.”

(Luke 8:50) 
But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, “Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.”

(Luke 8:51) 
When He came to the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.

(Luke 8:52) 
Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, “Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.”

(Luke 8:53) 
And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.

(Luke 8:54) 
But He, taking her by the hand, called out, saying, “Little girl, arise.”

(Luke 8:55) 
Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.

(Luke 8:56) 
And her parents were astonished, but He commanded them to tell no one what had happened.

(Luke 9:1) 
Then, collecting the twelve Apostles, He gave them power and authority over all demons, to heal sicknesses.

(Luke 9:2) 
And He sent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

(Luke 9:3) 
And He said to them: "Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.

(Luke 9:4) 
And into whatsoever house you shall enter, there abide, and do not depart from there.

(Luke 9:5) 
And whosoever will not receive you, going out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."

(Luke 9:6) 
Going forth, they went about through the towns, preaching the Gospel and healing everywhere.

(Luke 9:7) 
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by Him. And he was in doubt, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead;

(Luke 9:8) 
but by some, that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the prophets of old was risen again.

(Luke 9:9) 
And Herod said: "John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see Him.

(Luke 9:10) 
And the Apostles, when they were returned, told Him all they had done. And taking them, He went aside into a desert place, which is called Bethsaida.

(Luke 9:11) 
And when the crowds knew it, they followed Him; and He welcomed them and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God and healed those who had need of healing.

(Luke 9:12) 
But the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to Him: "Send away the crowds, that they may go into the towns and the villages around, and lodge, and find provisions, for here we are in a desert place."

(Luke 9:13) 
But He said to them: "Give them to eat." And they said: "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people."

(Luke 9:14) 
For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples: "Make them sit down by fifties in a company."

(Luke 9:15) 
And they did so, and made them all sit down.

(Luke 9:16) 
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them; and He broke them and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

(Luke 9:17) 
And they all ate and were filled. And there were taken up what remained to them of fragments, twelve baskets.

(Luke 9:18) 
And it came to pass, as He was alone praying, that His disciples were with Him; and He asked them, saying: "Whom do the people say that I am?"

(Luke 9:19) 
But they answering, said: "John the Baptist"; and others say: "Elias"; and others: "That one of the former prophets has risen again."

(Luke 9:20) 
Then He said to them: "But whom do you say that I am?" Peter answering, said: "The Christ of God."

(Luke 9:21) 
But He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one.

(Luke 9:22) 
Saying: "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and rise again on the third day."

(Luke 9:23) 
And He said to all: "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross every day, and follow Me.

(Luke 9:24) 
For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; but he who shall lose his life for My sake, shall save it.

(Luke 9:25) 
For what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but lose himself, and suffer harm?

(Luke 9:26) 
For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed, when He shall come in His majesty and that of the Father and of the holy angels.

(Luke 9:27) 
And I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death, until they see the kingdom of God."

(Luke 9:28) 
And it came to pass after these words, that He took Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray.

(Luke 9:29) 
And it came to pass, as He was praying, that the appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became white and shining.

(Luke 9:30) 
And behold, two men were talking with Him. And they were Moses and Elias,

(Luke 9:31) 
who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His decease that He was to accomplish in Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:32) 
Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And when they were awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.

(Luke 9:33) 
And it came to pass, as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus: "Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elias," not knowing what he said.

(Luke 9:34) 
And as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they were afraid when they entered into the cloud.

(Luke 9:35) 
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: "This is My beloved Son; hear Him."

(Luke 9:36) 
And while the voice was made, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace and told no one in those days any of the things that they had seen.

(Luke 9:37) 
And it came to pass the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a great crowd met Him.

(Luke 9:38) 
And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying: "Master, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child:

(Luke 9:39) 
and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out and convulses him with foaming, and scarcely departs from him, bruising him.

(Luke 9:40) 
And I begged Your disciples to cast him out, and they could not."

(Luke 9:41) 
And Jesus answering, said: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring your son here."

(Luke 9:42) 
And as he was coming, the devil threw him down and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.

(Luke 9:43) 
And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. But while all were wondering at all the things that He was doing, He said to His disciples:

(Luke 9:44) 
"Let these words sink down into your ears: For it is destined that the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men."

(Luke 9:45) 
But they did not understand this word; and it was hidden from them, so that they should not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask Him about this word.

(Luke 9:46) 
Then a thought arose in them, which of them should be the greater.

(Luke 9:47) 
But Jesus, seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and placed him beside Himself.

(Luke 9:48) 
And He said to them: "Whosoever shall receive this child in My name, receives Me. And whosoever receives Me, receives Him Who sent Me. For he who is the lesser among you all, he is the greater."

(Luke 9:49) 
And John answering, said: "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us."

(Luke 9:50) 
And Jesus said to him: "Do not forbid him; for he who is not against you is for you."

(Luke 9:51) 
And it came to pass, when the days of His assumption were being fulfilled, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:52) 
And He sent messengers before His face; and going in, they entered into a city of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.

(Luke 9:53) 
And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:54) 
And when His disciples James and John saw this, they said: "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"

(Luke 9:55) 
And turning, He rebuked them, saying: "You do not know of what spirit you are."

(Luke 9:56) 
The Son of Man came not to destroy souls, but to save them." And they went into another town.

(Luke 9:57) 
And it came to pass, as they were going on the road, that someone said to Him: "I will follow You wherever You go."

(Luke 9:58) 
And Jesus said to him: "The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."

(Luke 9:59) 
And He said to another: "Follow Me." But he said: "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."

(Luke 9:60) 
And Jesus said to him: "Let the dead bury their dead; but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."

(Luke 9:61) 
And another also said: "I will follow You, Lord; but allow me first to bid farewell to those at home."

(Luke 9:62) 
To whom Jesus said: "No one putting his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God."

(Luke 10:1) 
After these things, the Lord then designated seventy-two others and sent them, two by two, before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to go.

(Luke 10:2) 
He said, therefore, to them: "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that He send laborers into His harvest."

(Luke 10:3) 
Go; behold, I send you as lambs among wolves.

(Luke 10:4) 
Do not carry a bag, nor a satchel, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way.

(Luke 10:5) 
Into whatsoever house you enter, first say: "Peace be to this house."

(Luke 10:6) 
And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.

(Luke 10:7) 
And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things that they have, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.

(Luke 10:8) 
And into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you:

(Luke 10:9) 
And heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'

(Luke 10:10) 
But into whatsoever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into the streets of the same, say:

(Luke 10:11) 
Even the dust that has stuck to us from your city we wipe off against you; however, know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.

(Luke 10:12) 
I tell you, that it will be more tolerable for the Sodomites in that day, than for that city.

(Luke 10:13) 
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powers that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

(Luke 10:14) 
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.

(Luke 10:15) 
And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to hell.

(Luke 10:16) 
He who hears you, hears Me; and he who rejects you, rejects Me; and he who rejects Me, rejects Him who sent Me.

(Luke 10:17) 
And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying: "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."

(Luke 10:18) 
And He said to them: "I saw Satan like lightning falling from the sky.

(Luke 10:19) 
Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall harm you.

(Luke 10:20) 
However, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice more that your names are written in heaven."

(Luke 10:21) 
In that hour, rejoicing in the Spirit, He exclaimed and said: "I confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to little ones. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."

(Luke 10:22) 
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him."

(Luke 10:23) 
And turning to the disciples, He said: "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

(Luke 10:24) 
For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it; and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it."

(Luke 10:25) 
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, tempting Him, and saying: "Teacher, what must I do to possess eternal life?"

(Luke 10:26) 
And He said to him: "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"

(Luke 10:27) 
He answering said: "You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."

(Luke 10:28) 
And He said to him: "You have answered rightly; do this and you will live."

(Luke 10:29) 
But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus: "And who is my neighbor?"

(Luke 10:30) 
Jesus answering, said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who also, having stripped him and inflicted wounds, departed, leaving him half dead.

(Luke 10:31) 
And it happened that a certain priest was going down the same way; and seeing him, he passed by.

(Luke 10:32) 
And likewise a Levite, when he was near the place, and saw him, passed by.

(Luke 10:33) 
But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came near him; and seeing him, he was moved with compassion.

(Luke 10:34) 
And approaching, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and putting him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

(Luke 10:35) 
And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said: 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, I will repay you when I return.'

(Luke 10:36) 
Which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?

(Luke 10:37) 
And he said: "He who showed mercy on him." And Jesus said to him: "Go, and do likewise."

(Luke 10:38) 
Now it came to pass, as they went, that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.

(Luke 10:39) 
And she had a sister named Mary, who also, sitting beside the feet of the Lord, was listening to His Word.

(Luke 10:40) 
But Martha was occupied about much serving. Who stood and said: "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me alone to serve? Tell her, therefore, to help me."

(Luke 10:41) 
And the Lord answering, said to her: "Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and you are troubled about many things;

(Luke 10:42) 
but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her."

(Luke 11:1) 
One day, after Jesus had finished praying, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”

(Luke 11:2) 
He said to them, “When you pray, say: 'Father, may Your name be kept holy. May Your kingdom come.'

(Luke 11:3) 
Give us each day the food we need for that day.

(Luke 11:4) 
And forgive us our sins, as we too forgive all who are in debt to us. And do not lead us into temptation.”

(Luke 11:5) 
Then He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,

(Luke 11:6) 
because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?’

(Luke 11:7) 
And he from within will answer, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’

(Luke 11:8) 
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.

(Luke 11:9) 
So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

(Luke 11:10) 
For everyone who asks receives; everyone who searches finds; and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.

(Luke 11:11) 
What father among you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake instead of a fish?

(Luke 11:12) 
Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

(Luke 11:13) 
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

(Luke 11:14) 
Jesus was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute person spoke; and the crowds were amazed.

(Luke 11:15) 
But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.”

(Luke 11:16) 
Others, trying to test Him, asked Him for a sign from heaven.

(Luke 11:17) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house will fall.

(Luke 11:18) 
And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.

(Luke 11:19) 
Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

(Luke 11:20) 
But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

(Luke 11:21) 
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his palace, his goods are in peace.

(Luke 11:22) 
But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoils.

(Luke 11:23) 
Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.”

(Luke 11:24) 
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through arid places looking for rest, and finding none it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’

(Luke 11:25) 
And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order.

(Luke 11:26) 
Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.”

(Luke 11:27) 
As He was saying these things, a woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts that nursed You!”

(Luke 11:28) 
But He said, “Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”

(Luke 11:29) 
As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, “This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

(Luke 11:30) 
For just as Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.

(Luke 11:31) 
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here.

(Luke 11:32) 
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, something greater than Jonah is here.

(Luke 11:33) 
“No one, when they have lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

(Luke 11:34) 
The eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.

(Luke 11:35) 
Therefore be careful that the light in you is not darkness.

(Luke 11:36) 
If then your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”

(Luke 11:37) 
While He was speaking, a Pharisee asked Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.

(Luke 11:38) 
The Pharisee was surprised to see that He did not wash before dinner.

(Luke 11:39) 
And the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

(Luke 11:40) 
You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside also?

(Luke 11:41) 
But give as charity the things that are within, and then all things will be clean for you.

(Luke 11:42) 
“But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and you ignore justice and the love of God; these things you should have done, without neglecting the others.

(Luke 11:43) 
Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.

(Luke 11:44) 
Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.”

(Luke 11:45) 
Then one of the lawyers answered Him, “Teacher, in saying these things You insult us too.”

(Luke 11:46) 
And He said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

(Luke 11:47) 
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.

(Luke 11:48) 
So you are witnesses and you approve the deeds of your ancestors, because they killed the prophets and you build their tombs.

(Luke 11:49) 
Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,’

(Luke 11:50) 
so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,

(Luke 11:51) 
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.

(Luke 11:52) 
“Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and those who were entering you hindered.”

(Luke 11:53) 
As He went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press Him hard and to provoke Him to speak about many things,

(Luke 11:54) 
seeking to catch Him in something He might say.

(Luke 12:1) 
Meanwhile, when many thousands of people gathered together, crushing each other, Jesus began to speak to His disciples, saying: "Be careful of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees!"

(Luke 12:2) 
For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor is there anything secret that will not be known.

(Luke 12:3) 
Therefore, whatever you speak in darkness will be spoken in the light, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.

(Luke 12:4) 
I say to you, my friends: Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that, they cannot do anything more.

(Luke 12:5) 
I will show you whom you should fear: fear the One who, after killing, has the power to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him.

(Luke 12:6) 
Are not five sparrows sold for two coins? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.

(Luke 12:7) 
Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.

(Luke 12:8) 
I tell you: Whoever acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.

(Luke 12:9) 
But whoever disowns Me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.

(Luke 12:10) 
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

(Luke 12:11) 
When they bring you before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should respond or what you should say,

(Luke 12:12) 
For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.

(Luke 12:13) 
Then someone from the crowd said to Him: "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."

(Luke 12:14) 
Jesus replied to him: "Man, who appointed Me a judge or divider over you?"

(Luke 12:15) 
And He said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed, for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."

(Luke 12:16) 
Then He told them a parable: "The land of a rich man produced an abundant crop.

(Luke 12:17) 
And he thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'

(Luke 12:18) 
And he said, 'This is what I will do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.'

(Luke 12:19) 
And I will say to myself, 'You have many good things stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, and be merry.'

(Luke 12:20) 
But God said to him, 'You fool! This night your soul is required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?'

(Luke 12:21) 
So is the man who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."

(Luke 12:22) 
And He said to His disciples, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will put on.

(Luke 12:23) 
For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.

(Luke 12:24) 
Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, who have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them. How much more are you better than the birds?

(Luke 12:25) 
And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his stature?

(Luke 12:26) 
If you cannot do the least, why are you anxious about the rest?

(Luke 12:27) 
Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.

(Luke 12:28) 
Now if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?

(Luke 12:29) 
And do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink, nor be anxious.

(Luke 12:30) 
For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things.

(Luke 12:31) 
But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you.

(Luke 12:32) 
Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

(Luke 12:33) 
Sell what you have and give alms; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys.

(Luke 12:34) 
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

(Luke 12:35) 
Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning;

(Luke 12:36) 
and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master to return from the wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.

(Luke 12:37) 
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes! Truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.

(Luke 12:38) 
If he comes in the second watch, or if he comes in the third watch, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!

(Luke 12:39) 
But understand this: If the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

(Luke 12:40) 
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.

(Luke 12:41) 
Peter said to Him: "Lord, are You telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"

(Luke 12:42) 
And the Lord said: "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward whom his master will put in charge of his servants to give them their portion of food at the proper time?

(Luke 12:43) 
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.

(Luke 12:44) 
Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

(Luke 12:45) 
But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is delaying his coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,

(Luke 12:46) 
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful.

(Luke 12:47) 
And that servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do what was required of him will be beaten with many blows.

(Luke 12:48) 
But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a few blows. To whom much is given, much will be required, and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded.

(Luke 12:49) 
I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!

(Luke 12:50) 
But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am constrained until it is completed!

(Luke 12:51) 
Do you think that I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.

(Luke 12:52) 
For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two, and two against three.

(Luke 12:53) 
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

(Luke 12:54) 
He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.

(Luke 12:55) 
And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching heat,' and it happens.

(Luke 12:56) 
You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?

(Luke 12:57) 
And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?

(Luke 12:58) 
When you go with your accuser before a magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

(Luke 12:59) 
I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny.

(Luke 13:1) 
At that time, some people told Jesus about some Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

(Luke 13:2) 
And He answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?

(Luke 13:3) 
I tell you, no; but unless you do penance, you will all perish in the same way.

(Luke 13:4) 
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell—do you think that they were debtors above all the people who live in Jerusalem?

(Luke 13:5) 
I tell you, no; but unless you do penance, you will all perish in the same way.

(Luke 13:6) 
He spoke also this parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.

(Luke 13:7) 
He said to the vinedresser, 'Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why does it still occupy the ground?'

(Luke 13:8) 
But he answering, said to him, 'Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.

(Luke 13:9) 
And if it bears fruit, well; but if not, then after that you can cut it down.'

(Luke 13:10) 
And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

(Luke 13:11) 
And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; and she was bent over and could not in any way look up.

(Luke 13:12) 
When Jesus saw her, He called her and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."

(Luke 13:13) 
And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

(Luke 13:14) 
And the ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days on which work ought to be done; come, therefore, and be cured on those days, and not on the Sabbath day."

(Luke 13:15) 
The Lord answered him, "Hypocrite, does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead them away to water?

(Luke 13:16) 
And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?"

(Luke 13:17) 
And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the people were rejoicing at all the glorious things that were being done by Him.

(Luke 13:18) 
He was saying therefore: "To what is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?

(Luke 13:19) 
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches."

(Luke 13:20) 
And again He said, "To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

(Luke 13:21) 
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."

(Luke 13:22) 
And He was going through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying towards Jerusalem.

(Luke 13:23) 
And someone said to Him, "Lord, are only a few being saved?"

(Luke 13:24) 
But He said to them, "Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

(Luke 13:25) 
When once the householder has risen and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us.' And He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'

(Luke 13:26) 
Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.'

(Luke 13:27) 
And He will say to you, 'I do not know where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.'

(Luke 13:28) 
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.

(Luke 13:29) 
And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.

(Luke 13:30) 
And behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.

(Luke 13:31) 
At that very hour, some Pharisees came up and said to Him, "Go away and depart from here, for Herod wishes to kill You."

(Luke 13:32) 
And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected.'

(Luke 13:33) 
Nevertheless, I must go on My way today and tomorrow and the next day; for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem.

(Luke 13:34) 
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!

(Luke 13:35) 
Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I say to you that you shall not see Me until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.'

(Luke 14:1) 
One sabbath, Jesus went to eat bread in the house of a leader of the Pharisees, and they were all watching Him closely.

(Luke 14:2) 
A man suffering from dropsy was present before them.

(Luke 14:3) 
Jesus responded, asking the lawyers and Pharisees, “Is it permissible to heal on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 14:4) 
They remained silent. Then, taking hold of the man, He healed him and let him go.

(Luke 14:5) 
Then, He said to them, “If your donkey or ox falls into a well, who among you won’t immediately pull it out, even on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 14:6) 
They were not able to respond to these things.

(Luke 14:7) 
He also told a parable to those who were invited, as He observed how they chose the best places at the table, saying to them:

(Luke 14:8) 
“When you are invited to a wedding feast, don’t recline in the best place, lest a more important person than you has been invited.

(Luke 14:9) 
Then, the one who invited you and the other guest may come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then you would begin to take the lowest place with shame.

(Luke 14:10) 
But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then it will be a glory to you in the sight of all those at table with you.

(Luke 14:11) 
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

(Luke 14:12) 
He also said to the one who invited Him: “When you give a lunch or a dinner, don’t invite your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you back, and you will be repaid.

(Luke 14:13) 
But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.

(Luke 14:14) 
Then you will be blessed, because they have no means to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”

(Luke 14:15) 
Hearing this, one of those reclining at table with Him said to Him, “Blessed is the one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

(Luke 14:16) 
But He said to him: “A man once gave a great dinner and invited many.

(Luke 14:17) 
And at the time of the dinner, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited to come, because everything was now ready.

(Luke 14:18) 
But they all began to make excuses together. The first one said to him, ‘I bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it. I ask you, consider me excused.’

(Luke 14:19) 
And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m going to try them out. I ask you, consider me excused.’

(Luke 14:20) 
And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’

(Luke 14:21) 
The servant returned and reported these things to his master. Then, the master of the house, angered, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.’

(Luke 14:22) 
The servant said, ‘Master, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’

(Luke 14:23) 
And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.’

(Luke 14:24) 
I tell you, that none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner.”

(Luke 14:25) 
Large crowds were traveling with Him; and turning, He said to them:

(Luke 14:26) 
“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:27) 
And whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:28) 
For which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?

(Luke 14:29) 
Otherwise, after laying the foundation but not being able to complete it, all who see it may begin to ridicule him,

(Luke 14:30) 
saying, ‘This man began to build but was not able to finish.’

(Luke 14:31) 
Or what king, going to war against another king, does not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?

(Luke 14:32) 
If he is not able, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.

(Luke 14:33) 
So, in the same way, whoever of you does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:34) 
Salt is good; but if the salt loses its flavor, with what will it be seasoned?

(Luke 14:35) 
It is neither good for the land nor for the manure pile; they throw it out. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Luke 15:1) 
The tax collectors and other sinners were approaching Jesus to listen to Him.

(Luke 15:2) 
But the Pharisees and scribes were murmuring. They said, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

(Luke 15:3) 
He then told them this parable:

(Luke 15:4) 
“If one of you has one hundred sheep, and loses one of them, won't you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until you find it?

(Luke 15:5) 
And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders rejoicing.

(Luke 15:6) 
When he arrives home, he calls his friends and neighbors, saying to them: ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my sheep that was lost.’”

(Luke 15:7) 
“I tell you, there will be more joy in the sky over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance.”

(Luke 15:8) 
“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins, if she loses one, does she not light a lamp, sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it?

(Luke 15:9) 
When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors, saying: ‘Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I had lost.’”

(Luke 15:10) 
“So I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

(Luke 15:11) 
And He said: “A certain man had two sons:

(Luke 15:12) 
The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of inheritance that belongs to me.’ So the father divided his property between them.

(Luke 15:13) 
Not long after, the younger son gathered all his possessions and set off for a distant country. There, he squandered his wealth in wild living.

(Luke 15:14) 
When he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.

(Luke 15:15) 
So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed swine.

(Luke 15:16) 
And he longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.

(Luke 15:17) 
Then, when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, and I am dying here of hunger?

(Luke 15:18) 
I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against the sky and before you.

(Luke 15:19) 
I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”

(Luke 15:20) 
So he arose and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him, and kissed him.

(Luke 15:21) 
And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against the sky and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

(Luke 15:22) 
But the father said to his servants, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

(Luke 15:23) 
Also bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us eat and celebrate.

(Luke 15:24) 
For this my son was dead and has come back to life; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.

(Luke 15:25) 
Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

(Luke 15:26) 
He summoned one of the servants and asked what these things meant.

(Luke 15:27) 
The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’

(Luke 15:28) 
But he was angry and refused to go in. Therefore his father came out and began to plead with him.

(Luke 15:29) 
But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends.

(Luke 15:30) 
But when this son of yours, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, came, you killed the fattened calf for him.’

(Luke 15:31) 
And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.

(Luke 15:32) 
But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead and has come back to life, and was lost and is found.’”

(Luke 16:1) 
Jesus also said to his disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. This manager was accused of wasting his possessions.

(Luke 16:2) 
So the rich man called him and said, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can no longer be my manager.’

(Luke 16:3) 
The manager said to himself, ‘What am I going to do now that my master is taking away my management? I cannot dig, and I am ashamed to beg.’

(Luke 16:4) 
‘I know what I will do, so that, when I am removed from my management, people may welcome me into their houses.’

(Luke 16:5) 
So he summoned each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’

(Luke 16:6) 
He replied, ‘One hundred measures of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Here is your bill. Sit down quickly and write fifty.’

(Luke 16:7) 
Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘One hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’

(Luke 16:8) 
And the master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.

(Luke 16:9) 
And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.

(Luke 16:10) 
He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much. And he who is unjust in a very little thing is unjust also in much.

(Luke 16:11) 
If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will trust you with the true wealth?

(Luke 16:12) 
And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?

(Luke 16:13) 
No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

(Luke 16:14) 
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things, and they ridiculed Him.

(Luke 16:15) 
And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

(Luke 16:16) 
The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since then the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it.

(Luke 16:17) 
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.

(Luke 16:18) 
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.

(Luke 16:19) 
“There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and who feasted sumptuously every day.

(Luke 16:20) 
And at his gate was laid a certain beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores,

(Luke 16:21) 
longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.

(Luke 16:22) 
So it was that the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried in hell.

(Luke 16:23) 
And in hell, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.

(Luke 16:24) 
And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.’

(Luke 16:25) 
But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented.’

(Luke 16:26) 
And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.’

(Luke 16:27) 
And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father’s house—

(Luke 16:28) 
for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.’

(Luke 16:29) 
But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’

(Luke 16:30) 
And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’

(Luke 16:31) 
He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though someone rises from the dead.’

(Luke 17:1) 
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "It is impossible that no scandals come, but woe to him by whom they come!"

(Luke 17:2) 
It is better for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is thrown into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.

(Luke 17:3) 
Be careful about this. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

(Luke 17:4) 
And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times a day turns back to you saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.

(Luke 17:5) 
And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."

(Luke 17:6) 
And the Lord said: "If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you."

(Luke 17:7) 
But who of you, having a servant plowing or feeding sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'?

(Luke 17:8) 
And will he not say to him, 'Prepare my dinner, and gird yourself and serve me, until I have eaten and drunk; and afterward you shall eat and drink'?

(Luke 17:9) 
Does he thank that servant because he did the things commanded him? I do not think so.

(Luke 17:10) 
So you also, when you have done all that is commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have done what we ought to do.'

(Luke 17:11) 
And it came to pass as He was going to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

(Luke 17:12) 
And as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.

(Luke 17:13) 
And they lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"

(Luke 17:14) 
And when He saw them, He said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And it happened that as they went, they were cleansed.

(Luke 17:15) 
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, glorifying God with a loud voice,

(Luke 17:16) 
and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.

(Luke 17:17) 
And Jesus answering, said: "Were there not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?

(Luke 17:18) 
Was there not any found to return and give glory to God, except this foreigner?

(Luke 17:19) 
And He said to him, "Arise, go your way; your faith has made you whole."

(Luke 17:20) 
And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation;"

(Luke 17:21) 
nor will they say, 'See here!' or 'See there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you."

(Luke 17:22) 
Then He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.

(Luke 17:23) 
And they will say to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go, nor follow them.

(Luke 17:24) 
For as the lightning flashes out of one part under heaven, and shines to the other part under heaven, so also will the Son of Man be in His day.

(Luke 17:25) 
But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

(Luke 17:26) 
And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the Son of Man:

(Luke 17:27) 
they ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

(Luke 17:28) 
Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

(Luke 17:29) 
but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

(Luke 17:30) 
Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.

(Luke 17:31) 
In that day, he who is on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back.

(Luke 17:32) 
Remember Lot's wife.

(Luke 17:33) 
Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.

(Luke 17:34) 
I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed: one will be taken and the other will be left.

(Luke 17:35) 
Two women will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.

(Luke 17:36) 
Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.

(Luke 17:37) 
And answering, they said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together."

(Luke 18:1) 
Jesus told this parable to those who were very confident in their own righteousness and who looked down on everyone else:

(Luke 18:2) 
“Two men went up to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.

(Luke 18:3) 
“The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—thieves, rogues, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.

(Luke 18:4) 
I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of all I get.’

(Luke 18:5) 
“But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’

(Luke 18:6) 
“I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

(Luke 18:7) 
People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to touch. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

(Luke 18:8) 
But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

(Luke 18:9) 
Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

(Luke 18:10) 
A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

(Luke 18:11) 
“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone.

(Luke 18:12) 
You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’

(Luke 18:13) 
“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he replied.

(Luke 18:14) 
When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”

(Luke 18:15) 
When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.

(Luke 18:16) 
Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!

(Luke 18:17) 
Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”

(Luke 18:18) 
Those who heard this asked, “Then who can be saved?”

(Luke 18:19) 
Jesus replied, “What is impossible for human beings is possible for God.”

(Luke 18:20) 
Peter said, “We have left our own homes and followed you.”

(Luke 18:21) 
And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left home or parents or brothers or sisters or wife or children for the sake of the kingdom of God

(Luke 18:22) 
who will not receive many times more in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.”

(Luke 18:23) 
Then he took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be fulfilled.

(Luke 18:24) 
He will be delivered over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, insulted, and spat upon.

(Luke 18:25) 
They will flog him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.”

(Luke 18:26) 
The disciples understood none of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.

(Luke 18:27) 
As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside.

(Luke 18:28) 
When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.

(Luke 18:29) 
They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”

(Luke 18:30) 
He cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

(Luke 18:31) 
Those who were in front told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”

(Luke 18:32) 
Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,

(Luke 18:33) 
“What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord,” he replied, “I want to see.”

(Luke 18:34) 
Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. When all the people saw this, they also praised God.

(Luke 19:1) 
And having entered, He was passing through Jericho.

(Luke 19:2) 
And behold, a man, by the name of Zacchaeus: and he was the chief of the tax collectors, and he himself was rich:

(Luke 19:3) 
and he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was: and he could not because of the crowd, because he was small in stature.

(Luke 19:4) 
And running ahead, he ran behind, and he climbed a sycamore tree to see Him: because He was to pass by that way.

(Luke 19:5) 
And when He had come to the place, looking up, Jesus saw him, and said to him: "Zacchaeus, hurry down: because today I must stay in your house."

(Luke 19:6) 
And he hurried down, and received Him, rejoicing.

(Luke 19:7) 
And when all saw, they murmured, saying that He had turned aside to a sinful man.

(Luke 19:8) 
But standing, Zacchaeus said to the Lord: "Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor: and if I have defrauded anyone, I restore fourfold."

(Luke 19:9) 
Jesus said to him: "Today salvation has come to this house: because he is also a son of Abraham."

(Luke 19:10) 
For the Son of Man came to seek, and to save that which was lost.

(Luke 19:11) 
And while they were listening to these things, He added a parable: because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

(Luke 19:12) 
He said therefore: "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."

(Luke 19:13) 
And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten talents, and said to them: 'Do business until I come."

(Luke 19:14) 
But his citizens hated him: and they sent a delegation after him, saying: 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'

(Luke 19:15) 
And it came to pass that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what they had gained.

(Luke 19:16) 
And the first came, saying: 'Lord, your talent has gained ten talents.'

(Luke 19:17) 
And he said to him: 'Well done, good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you will have power over ten cities.'

(Luke 19:18) 
And the second came, saying: 'Lord, your talent has made five talents.'

(Luke 19:19) 
And to this one he said: 'You also shall be over five cities.'

(Luke 19:20) 
And another came, saying: 'Lord, behold, your talent, which I had put away in a napkin:

(Luke 19:21) 
For I feared you, because you are a harsh man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'

(Luke 19:22) 
He said to him: 'By your own mouth I judge you, wicked servant. You knew that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:

(Luke 19:23) 
and why did you not put my money at the table? And I, coming, might have required it with interest.'

(Luke 19:24) 
And to those who were standing there, he said: 'Take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has ten talents.'

(Luke 19:25) 
And they said to him: 'Lord, he has ten talents.'

(Luke 19:26) 
I tell you, because to everyone who has, more will be given, and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

(Luke 19:27) 
But as for those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here, and kill them before me.'

(Luke 19:28) 
And when He had said these things, He went on, going up to Jerusalem.

(Luke 19:29) 
And it happened, when He had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain that is called Olivet, He sent two of His disciples,

(Luke 19:30) 
saying: 'Go into the village which is opposite you: entering into it, you will find a colt of an ass tied, on which no one has ever sat: untie him, and bring him.'

(Luke 19:31) 
And if anyone asks you: "Why are you untying it?" so shall you say to him: 'Because the Lord has need of his service.'

(Luke 19:32) 
And they that were sent went, and found it as He had told them.

(Luke 19:33) 
And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them: 'Why are you untying the colt?'

(Luke 19:34) 
And they said: 'Because the Lord has need of him.'

(Luke 19:35) 
And they led him to Jesus: and casting their garments on the colt, they placed Jesus on it.

(Luke 19:36) 
And as He went, they spread their garments in the way.

(Luke 19:37) 
And when He was now approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen,

(Luke 19:38) 
saying: "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."

(Luke 19:39) 
And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him: "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."

(Luke 19:40) 
To whom He said: "I tell you, that if these should be silent, the stones will cry out."

(Luke 19:41) 
And when He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,

(Luke 19:42) 
saying: "If only you had known, even you, and especially on this day, the things that belong to your peace: but now they are hidden from your eyes.

(Luke 19:43) 
For the days will come upon you: and your enemies will build a rampart around you, and they will encircle you and hem you in on every side:

(Luke 19:44) 
and they will dash you to the ground, and your children within you: and they will not leave in you one stone upon another: because you did not know the time of your visitation."

(Luke 19:45) 
And entering the temple, He began to cast out those who were selling and buying in it,

(Luke 19:46) 
saying to them: "It is written: 'My house is a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of thieves."

(Luke 19:47) 
And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief men of the people sought to destroy Him:

(Luke 19:48) 
and they did not find what they could do to Him: for all the people were hanging on to Him, listening.

(Luke 20:1) 
One day, as Jesus was teaching the crowds in the Temple and preaching the Good News, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came up to Him.

(Luke 20:2) 
They said: “Tell us, by what authority do You do these things? Or who gave You this authority?”

(Luke 20:3) 
Jesus answered, saying to them: “I will also ask you one question. Answer Me,

(Luke 20:4) 
Was John’s baptism from Heaven, or from men?”

(Luke 20:5) 
They reasoned among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From Heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’

(Luke 20:6) 
But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, because they are certain that John was a prophet.”

(Luke 20:7) 
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.

(Luke 20:8) 
Jesus said to them: “Then neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Luke 20:9) 
Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went away for a long time.

(Luke 20:10) 
At the right time, he sent a servant to the tenant farmers, so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers, after beating him, sent him away empty-handed.

(Luke 20:11) 
So he sent another servant, but they beat him, insulted him, and sent him away empty-handed as well.

(Luke 20:12) 
Then he sent a third servant. They wounded this one and threw him out.

(Luke 20:13) 
Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Surely they will respect him.’

(Luke 20:14) 
But when the tenant farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance will be ours.’

(Luke 20:15) 
So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

(Luke 20:16) 
He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and will give the vineyard to others.” Hearing this, they said: “May it never be!”

(Luke 20:17) 
But looking at them, He said: “Then what does this Scripture mean: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?

(Luke 20:18) 
“Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and upon whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

(Luke 20:19) 
The chief priests and the scribes sought to arrest Him that very hour, but they feared the people, because they knew He had spoken this parable against them.

(Luke 20:20) 
Watching closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, to trap Him in His speech, so that they could hand Him over to the authority and the power of the governor.

(Luke 20:21) 
So they questioned Him, saying: “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and that You do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.

(Luke 20:22) 
Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

(Luke 20:23) 
But He perceived their craftiness and said to them: “Why do you test Me?

(Luke 20:24) 
Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?”

(Luke 20:25) 
They replied, “Caesar’s.” So He said to them: “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

(Luke 20:26) 
They could not take hold of His word in front of the people, and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.

(Luke 20:27) 
Then some Sadducees came up to Him, who deny the resurrection, and they questioned Him,

(Luke 20:28) 
saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.

(Luke 20:29) 
Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, but died childless.

(Luke 20:30) 
Then the second and third brother married her,

(Luke 20:31) 
and the third took her, and in the same way all seven, but they left no children and died.

(Luke 20:32) 
Finally, the woman died too.

(Luke 20:33) 
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as a wife.”

(Luke 20:34) 
Jesus said to them: “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,

(Luke 20:35) 
but those who are considered worthy to attain the next age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.

(Luke 20:36) 
For they cannot die anymore, since they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

(Luke 20:37) 
But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

(Luke 20:38) 
Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”

(Luke 20:39) 
Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well.”

(Luke 20:40) 
And they dared not question Him any further.

(Luke 20:41) 
Then He said to them: “How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?

(Luke 20:42) 
For David himself says in the Book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand,

(Luke 20:43) 
until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’

(Luke 20:44) 
David therefore calls Him Lord, so how is He his son?

(Luke 20:45) 
As all the people were listening, He said to His disciples:

(Luke 20:46) 
“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.

(Luke 20:47) 
They devour the houses of widows, pretending to pray at length; these will receive a greater condemnation.”

(Luke 21:1) 
And having raised His eyes, He saw those who were throwing their gifts into the treasury.

(Luke 21:2) 
He also saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites.

(Luke 21:3) 
And He said: "Truly, I say to you, that this poor widow put in more than all the rest.

(Luke 21:4) 
For all these put in gifts out of their abundance, into the works of God: but she from that which she lacks, she put in her whole living."

(Luke 21:5) 
And as some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with good stones and gifts, He said:

(Luke 21:6) 
"These things which you see, the days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone that will not be torn down."

(Luke 21:7) 
And they asked Him, saying: "Teacher, when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to happen?"

(Luke 21:8) 
Who said: "See that you are not seduced; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and 'The time is at hand.' Do not therefore go after them.

(Luke 21:9) 
And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end is not immediately."

(Luke 21:10) 
Then He said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

(Luke 21:11) 
And great earthquakes will be in various places, and plagues, and famines; and terrors from heaven, and great signs will be.

(Luke 21:12) 
But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, dragging you to kings and governors for My name's sake.

(Luke 21:13) 
And this will be for a testimony to you.

(Luke 21:14) 
Therefore lay it up in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how you should answer.

(Luke 21:15) 
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.

(Luke 21:16) 
But you will be delivered up even by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and some of you they will put to death.

(Luke 21:17) 
And you will be hated by all because of My name.

(Luke 21:18) 
And not a hair of your head will perish.

(Luke 21:19) 
In your patience you will possess your souls.

(Luke 21:20) 
And when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, then know that its desolation has drawn near.

(Luke 21:21) 
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and those who are in the midst of it, depart; and those who are in the regions, not enter into it.

(Luke 21:22) 
For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

(Luke 21:23) 
But woe to those who are pregnant and nursing in those days; for there will be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

(Luke 21:24) 
And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

(Luke 21:25) 
And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea and the waves,

(Luke 21:26) 
men withering away for fear, and for expectation of the things which will come upon the whole world: for the powers of the heavens will be moved.

(Luke 21:27) 
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty.

(Luke 21:28) 
And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.

(Luke 21:29) 
And He spoke to them a parable: "See the fig tree, and all the trees:

(Luke 21:30) 
When they are already budding, you know that summer is near.

(Luke 21:31) 
So you also, when you see these things happen, know that the kingdom of God is near.

(Luke 21:32) 
Amen I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, until all things are fulfilled.

(Luke 21:33) 
The universe and the earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

(Luke 21:34) 
And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with overeating and drunkenness and the cares of this life; and that day come upon you suddenly.

(Luke 21:35) 
For as a snare it will come upon all those who sit upon the face of the whole earth.

(Luke 21:36) 
Watch therefore, praying at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come, and to stand before the Son of Man.

(Luke 21:37) 
And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple; and going out in the night, He would stay at the mountain which is called Olivet.

(Luke 21:38) 
And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple to listen to Him.

(Luke 22:1) 
The feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was now approaching.

(Luke 22:2) 
The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put Him to death, but they were afraid of the people.

(Luke 22:3) 
Then Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.

(Luke 22:4) 
And he went away, and he spoke with the chief priests and the captains about how he might betray Him to them.

(Luke 22:5) 
They were glad, and they agreed to give him money.

(Luke 22:6) 
And he promised, and he sought an opportunity to betray Him in the absence of the crowd.

(Luke 22:7) 
Then came the day of the Unleavened Bread, on which it was necessary that the Passover should be sacrificed.

(Luke 22:8) 
And He sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat.”

(Luke 22:9) 
But they said, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”

(Luke 22:10) 
And He said to them, “Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.

(Luke 22:11) 
And you shall say to the master of the house: ‘The Master says to you: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’

(Luke 22:12) 
And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Prepare it there.”

(Luke 22:13) 
And they went, and they found as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Luke 22:14) 
And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the twelve Apostles with Him.

(Luke 22:15) 
And He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

(Luke 22:16) 
For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”

(Luke 22:17) 
And taking a chalice, He gave thanks and said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves.

(Luke 22:18) 
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”

(Luke 22:19) 
And taking bread, He gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”

(Luke 22:20) 
Likewise also the chalice, after supper, saying: “This is the chalice, the new testament in My blood, which will be poured out for you.”

(Luke 22:21) 
Yet behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.

(Luke 22:22) 
And truly the Son of Man goes according to what is determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”

(Luke 22:23) 
And they began to inquire among themselves who it was that would do this.

(Luke 22:24) 
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should seem to be the greater.

(Luke 22:25) 
But He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have power over them are called benefactors.

(Luke 22:26) 
But not so with you. Instead, let the one who is greatest among you become as the least, and the leader as the one who serves.

(Luke 22:27) 
For who is greater, the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am in your midst as one who serves.

(Luke 22:28) 
You are those who have remained with Me in My trials.

(Luke 22:29) 
And I appoint to you, as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,

(Luke 22:30) 
that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

(Luke 22:31) 
And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat.

(Luke 22:32) 
But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.”

(Luke 22:33) 
He said to Him, “Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.”

(Luke 22:34) 
But He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied Me three times that you know Me.”

(Luke 22:35) 
And He said to them, “When I sent you without a purse or a bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”

(Luke 22:36) 
They said, “Nothing.” Then He said to them, “But now, let the one who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag, and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.

(Luke 22:37) 
For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was reckoned with the lawless.’ For those things concerning Me have an end.”

(Luke 22:38) 
And they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It is enough.”

(Luke 22:39) 
And going out, He went as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.

(Luke 22:40) 
And when He arrived at the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

(Luke 22:41) 
And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw; and He knelt down and prayed,

(Luke 22:42) 
saying, “Father, if You are willing, remove this chalice from Me. But not My will, but Yours, be done.”

(Luke 22:43) 
And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him.

(Luke 22:44) 
And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

(Luke 22:45) 
And when He arose from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.

(Luke 22:46) 
And He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

(Luke 22:47) 
While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came up, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and approached Jesus to kiss Him.

(Luke 22:48) 
But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”

(Luke 22:49) 
When those who were with Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”

(Luke 22:50) 
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

(Luke 22:51) 
But Jesus answered and said, “Stop! No more of this.” And He touched his ear and healed him.

(Luke 22:52) 
Then Jesus said to those who had come out to Him, the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

(Luke 22:53) 
When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”

(Luke 22:54) 
Then, taking Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.

(Luke 22:55) 
And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting together, Peter was in the midst of them.

(Luke 22:56) 
But when a certain servant girl saw him sitting near the light, and looking closely at him, she said, “This man was also with Him.”

(Luke 22:57) 
But he denied Him, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”

(Luke 22:58) 
And after a little while, another one seeing him said, “You are also one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”

(Luke 22:59) 
And after about an hour had passed, another one was insisting, saying, “Truly, this man also was with Him, for he is also a Galilean.”

(Luke 22:60) 
But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

(Luke 22:61) 
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”

(Luke 22:62) 
And Peter went out and wept bitterly.

(Luke 22:63) 
And the men who were holding Him mocked Him, beating Him.

(Luke 22:64) 
And they blindfolded Him, and struck His face, and were questioning Him, saying, “Prophesy, who is the one who struck you?”

(Luke 22:65) 
And they were saying many other blasphemies against Him.

(Luke 22:66) 
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people assembled, along with the chief priests and scribes, and they led Him into their council,

(Luke 22:67) 
saying, “If You are the Christ, tell us.”

(Luke 22:68) 
But He said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe Me,

(Luke 22:69) 
and if I also ask you, you will not answer Me, nor will you let Me go.

(Luke 22:70) 
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”

(Luke 22:71) 
They all said, “Are You then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”

(Luke 22:72) 
And they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”

(Luke 23:1) 
And the entire crowd rose and led Him to Pilate.

(Luke 23:2) 
They began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding taxes to be paid to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ the King.”

(Luke 23:3) 
Pilate questioned Him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “You say so.”

(Luke 23:4) 
Pilate then said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no crime in this man.”

(Luke 23:5) 
But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.”

(Luke 23:6) 
When Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

(Luke 23:7) 
And when he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.

(Luke 23:8) 
Herod, upon seeing Jesus, was greatly pleased. For he had long desired to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle performed by Him.

(Luke 23:9) 
He questioned Him at length, but Jesus gave him no answer.

(Luke 23:10) 
Meanwhile, the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.

(Luke 23:11) 
Herod, along with his soldiers, scorned and mocked Jesus. He dressed Him in a white robe and sent Him back to Pilate.

(Luke 23:12) 
And on that day, Herod and Pilate became friends, for they had been enemies before.

(Luke 23:13) 
Pilate, having called together the chief priests, the magistrates, and the people,

(Luke 23:14) 
said to them, “You have brought this man to me as one who perverts the people. Behold, I have examined Him before you and have found in this man no cause for the accusations you bring against Him.

(Luke 23:15) 
Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him.

(Luke 23:16) 
Therefore, I will chastise Him and release Him.”

(Luke 23:17) 
Now, he was obliged to release one prisoner to them at the feast.

(Luke 23:18) 
Then the whole crowd cried out together, saying, “Away with this man, and release Barabbas to us:

(Luke 23:19) 
Barabbas, who had been imprisoned for a riot that occurred in the city, and for murder.

(Luke 23:20) 
Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,

(Luke 23:21) 
But they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”

(Luke 23:22) 
Pilate addressed them a third time: “Why? What evil has He done? I find no cause of death in Him. Therefore, I will chastise Him and release Him.”

(Luke 23:23) 
But they persisted, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

(Luke 23:24) 
So Pilate gave his decision that their demand should be granted.

(Luke 23:25) 
He released the man who was imprisoned for sedition and murder, the one they had asked for, but he handed Jesus over to their will.

(Luke 23:26) 
As they led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and they laid the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.

(Luke 23:27) 
A great crowd of people and women followed Him, and they were mourning and lamenting Him.

(Luke 23:28) 
But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

(Luke 23:29) 
For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’

(Luke 23:30) 
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’

(Luke 23:31) 
For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

(Luke 23:32) 
Two others, both criminals, were also being led away to be executed with Him.

(Luke 23:33) 
When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him, and also the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.

(Luke 23:34) 
And Jesus was saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” They divided His garments and cast lots.

(Luke 23:35) 
And the people stood watching, and the rulers scoffed at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the chosen one.”

(Luke 23:36) 
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him and offering Him vinegar,

(Luke 23:37) 
saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.”

(Luke 23:38) 
There was also an inscription over Him, written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”

(Luke 23:39) 
One of the criminals hanging there blasphemed Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”

(Luke 23:40) 
But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?

(Luke 23:41) 
And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”

(Luke 23:42) 
And he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.”

(Luke 23:43) 
And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”

(Luke 23:44) 
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.

(Luke 23:45) 
The sun was obscured, and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.

(Luke 23:46) 
And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.” And having said this, He breathed His last.

(Luke 23:47) 
When the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent.”

(Luke 23:48) 
And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, seeing what had taken place, returned home, beating their breasts.

(Luke 23:49) 
And all His acquaintances, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

(Luke 23:50) 
And behold, a man named Joseph, who was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, a good and righteous man,

(Luke 23:51) 
who had not agreed to their plan and action, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God,

(Luke 23:52) 
this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

(Luke 23:53) 
He took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever been laid.

(Luke 23:54) 
It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning.

(Luke 23:55) 
The women who had come with Him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.

(Luke 23:56) 
Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.

(Luke 24:1) 
Very early on the first day of the week, the women went to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.

(Luke 24:2) 
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

(Luke 24:3) 
They went inside, but they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.

(Luke 24:4) 
While they were stunned and didn't know what to make of this, two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them.

(Luke 24:5) 
The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. The men asked them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?

(Luke 24:6) 
He isn't here! He's risen! Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee,

(Luke 24:7) 
telling you that the Son of Man must be handed over to the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise on the third day?”

(Luke 24:8) 
Then they remembered His words.

(Luke 24:9) 
They returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the others.

(Luke 24:10) 
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told the apostles these things.

(Luke 24:11) 
The apostles thought what the women said was nonsense, and they didn't believe them.

(Luke 24:12) 
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw the linen cloths but nothing else. Then he went away, wondering what had happened.

(Luke 24:13) 
That same day, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,

(Luke 24:14) 
and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.

(Luke 24:15) 
As they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and walked with them.

(Luke 24:16) 
But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.

(Luke 24:17) 
He asked them, “What are you discussing with each other as you walk along?” They stopped, looking sad.

(Luke 24:18) 
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days?”

(Luke 24:19) 
He asked them, “What things?” They said, “About Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in word and deed before God and all the people,

(Luke 24:20) 
and how our chief priests and leaders handed Him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified Him.

(Luke 24:21) 
We had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.

(Luke 24:22) 
Some women of our group have astonished us. They went to the tomb early this morning,

(Luke 24:23) 
and didn't find His body. They came back saying they had even seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.

(Luke 24:24) 
Some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Him.”

(Luke 24:25) 
Then Jesus said to them, “You foolish people! You are slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

(Luke 24:26) 
Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter His glory?”

(Luke 24:27) 
And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

(Luke 24:28) 
As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if He were going farther.

(Luke 24:29) 
But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them.

(Luke 24:30) 
When He was at the table with them, He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and began to give it to them.

(Luke 24:31) 
Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. But He vanished from their sight.

(Luke 24:32) 
They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening the Scriptures to us?”

(Luke 24:33) 
They got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven disciples and those with them gathered together,

(Luke 24:34) 
and they were saying, “The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Simon!”

(Luke 24:35) 
Then the two disciples told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Him when He broke the bread.

(Luke 24:36) 
While they were talking about this, Jesus Himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace to you.” But they were startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost.

(Luke 24:37) 
But they were startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost.

(Luke 24:38) 
He said to them, “Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?

(Luke 24:39) 
Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself! Touch Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.”

(Luke 24:40) 
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.

(Luke 24:41) 
Because they still did not believe for joy, and were astonished, He said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”

(Luke 24:42) 
They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, and some honeycomb.

(Luke 24:43) 
He took it and ate it in front of them.

(Luke 24:44) 
Then He said to them, “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”

(Luke 24:45) 
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.

(Luke 24:46) 
He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ must suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,

(Luke 24:47) 
and repentance and forgiveness of sins must be preached in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

(Luke 24:48) 
You are witnesses of these things.

(Luke 24:49) 
And look, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

(Luke 24:50) 
Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

(Luke 24:51) 
As He was blessing them, He departed from them and was carried up into the universe.

(Luke 24:52) 
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

(Luke 24:53) 
and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

(John 1:1) 
Eternally, God the Son has been the Son of God the Father, and God the Son has had all the power, wisdom, and love of God the Father.

(John 1:2) 
God the Son has always been One God with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, who shares in all of the power, wisdom, and love of the Father and the Son.

(John 1:3) 
All things were made by Jesus Christ Our Lord, there is nothing that was not made by him.

(John 1:4) 
In His light is all fulfillment and everything meaningful about life.

(John 1:5) 
And the light of Him shined in the world darkened by sin, and the dark and sinful world could not understand Him.

(John 1:6) 
There was a man who was sent on a mission by God, and his name was John.

(John 1:7) 
He came to be a witness, to testify concerning the light, so that all might believe in the light.

(John 1:8) 
He wasn't the light, but he came to testify about the light.

(John 1:9) 
The true light was coming into the world, which illuminates every person.

(John 1:10) 
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know Him.

(John 1:11) 
He came to his own people, and his own people did not receive Him.

(John 1:12) 
But to all who did receive Him, He gave the power to become children of God; to those who believe in His name.

(John 1:13) 
They were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

(John 1:14) 
And God the Son became a man of flesh and blood, and He lived among us. We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

(John 1:15) 
John testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This is He who was to come after me, but He was before me, because He was before me.”

(John 1:16) 
From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.

(John 1:17) 
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

(John 1:18) 
No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is at the Father's side, He has made Him known.

(John 1:19) 
And this is the testimony of John: when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”

(John 1:20) 
He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”

(John 1:21) 
They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”

(John 1:22) 
So they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”

(John 1:23) 
He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”

(John 1:24) 
Now they who had been sent were from the Pharisees.

(John 1:25) 
And they asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”

(John 1:26) 
John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands One you do not know.

(John 1:27) 
He is the One who comes after me, who is before me, and I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.”

(John 1:28) 
These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

(John 1:29) 
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

(John 1:30) 
This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who is before me, because He was before me.’

(John 1:31) 
I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was so that He might be revealed to Israel.”

(John 1:32) 
And John testified, “I have seen the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him.

(John 1:33) 
I myself did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit descending and remaining, He is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’

(John 1:34) 
And I have seen, and I have testified that this is the Son of God.”

(John 1:35) 
The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples.

(John 1:36) 
And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”

(John 1:37) 
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

(John 1:38) 
Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, “What are you seeking?” They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”

(John 1:39) 
He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.

(John 1:40) 
One of the two who heard John and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

(John 1:41) 
He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).

(John 1:42) 
He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).

(John 1:43) 
The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, “Follow Me.”

(John 1:44) 
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

(John 1:45) 
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”

(John 1:46) 
And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”

(John 1:47) 
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”

(John 1:48) 
Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”

(John 1:49) 
Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”

(John 1:50) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”

(John 1:51) 
And He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

(John 2:1) 
On the third day, a wedding was held in Cana of Galilee. The Mother of Jesus was there.

(John 2:2) 
Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.

(John 2:3) 
When the wine gave out, the Mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."

(John 2:4) 
And Jesus said to her, "What is that to Me and to you, woman? My hour has not yet come."

(John 2:5) 
His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever He tells you."

(John 2:6) 
Now there were six stone water jars there, placed for the Jewish custom of cleansing, each holding two or three measures.

(John 2:7) 
Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them up to the brim.

(John 2:8) 
Then He said to them, "Draw some out now, and take it to the headwaiter." And they took it.

(John 2:9) 
When the headwaiter tasted the water that had been turned into wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom,

(John 2:10) 
and said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first; and when they have drunk freely, then the less good wine. But you have kept the good wine until now."

(John 2:11) 
Jesus did this as the beginning of His signs in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.

(John 2:12) 
After this He went down to Capernaum, with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.

(John 2:13) 
The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

(John 2:14) 
In the temple, He found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and also the money changers sitting there.

(John 2:15) 
And He made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.

(John 2:16) 
And to those who were selling doves, He said, "Take these things away; do not make My Father's house a house of trade."

(John 2:17) 
His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for Your house will consume me."

(John 2:18) 
The Jews then responded and said to Him, "What sign do You show us for doing these things?"

(John 2:19) 
Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."

(John 2:20) 
The Jews then said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will You raise it up in three days?"

(John 2:21) 
But He was speaking of the temple of His body.

(John 2:22) 
So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.

(John 2:23) 
Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the festival, many believed in His name because they saw the signs He was performing.

(John 2:24) 
But Jesus Himself was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all men,

(John 2:25) 
and because He had no need that anyone should testify about man, for He knew what was in man.

(John 3:1) 
There was a Pharisee, a leader of the Jews, named Nicodemus.

(John 3:2) 
This man came to see Jesus at night, and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent by God; because no one can do these signs which you do, unless God is with him.”

(John 3:3) 
Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

(John 3:4) 
Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”

(John 3:5) 
Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

(John 3:6) 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

(John 3:7) 
Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’

(John 3:8) 
The Spirit blows where He wishes, and you hear the sound of Him, but you do not know where He comes from, or where He goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

(John 3:9) 
Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?”

(John 3:10) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?

(John 3:11) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify to what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.

(John 3:12) 
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

(John 3:13) 
And no one has ascended into the sky except the one who descended from the sky, the Son of Man, who is in the sky.

(John 3:14) 
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;

(John 3:15) 
so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life.

(John 3:16) 
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

(John 3:17) 
For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

(John 3:18) 
He who believes in Him is not judged; but he who does not believe is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

(John 3:19) 
And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

(John 3:20) 
For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.

(John 3:21) 
But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, because they have been wrought in God.”

(John 3:22) 
After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was staying with them, and baptizing.

(John 3:23) 
John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they were coming and being baptized.

(John 3:24) 
For John had not yet been put in prison.

(John 3:25) 
Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews concerning purification.

(John 3:26) 
And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him.”

(John 3:27) 
John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.

(John 3:28) 
You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’

(John 3:29) 
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.

(John 3:30) 
He must increase, but I must decrease.

(John 3:31) 
He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of earthly things. He who comes from heaven is above all.

(John 3:32) 
And what He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.

(John 3:33) 
He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.

(John 3:34) 
For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.

(John 3:35) 
The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.

(John 3:36) 
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.

(John 4:1) 
The Lord realized that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,

(John 4:2) 
Though it was actually the disciples who were baptizing, not Jesus himself,

(John 4:3) 
He left Judea and went back into Galilee.

(John 4:4) 
But it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.

(John 4:5) 
He arrived at a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

(John 4:6) 
Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, tired from the journey, sat down beside the well. It was about noon.

(John 4:7) 
A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”

(John 4:8) 
For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.

(John 4:9) 
The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.”

(John 4:10) 
Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”

(John 4:11) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?

(John 4:12) 
Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, with his sons and his livestock?”

(John 4:13) 
Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.

(John 4:14) 
The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”

(John 4:15) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”

(John 4:16) 
Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”

(John 4:17) 
The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’:

(John 4:18) 
for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.”

(John 4:19) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

(John 4:20) 
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”

(John 4:21) 
Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.

(John 4:22) 
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.

(John 4:23) 
But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such to worship him.

(John 4:24) 
God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”

(John 4:25) 
The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.”

(John 4:26) 
Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one speaking to you.”

(John 4:27) 
Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What are you seeking?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”

(John 4:28) 
So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,

(John 4:29) 
“Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”

(John 4:30) 
They went out of the town and were coming to him.

(John 4:31) 
Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”

(John 4:32) 
But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”

(John 4:33) 
So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”

(John 4:34) 
Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.

(John 4:35) 
Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.

(John 4:36) 
Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering crops for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.

(John 4:37) 
For here the saying holds true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’

(John 4:38) 
I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”

(John 4:39) 
Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”

(John 4:40) 
So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.

(John 4:41) 
And many more believed because of his word.

(John 4:42) 
They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”

(John 4:43) 
After the two days he departed for Galilee.

(John 4:44) 
For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.

(John 4:45) 
So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.

(John 4:46) 
So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the wine from water. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.

(John 4:47) 
When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.

(John 4:48) 
So Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”

(John 4:49) 
The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”

(John 4:50) 
Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.

(John 4:51) 
As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering.

(John 4:52) 
So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”

(John 4:53) 
The father knew that it was at that hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And he himself believed, and all his household.

(John 4:54) 
This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.

(John 5:1) 
After these things, there was a feast day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

(John 5:2) 
Now in Jerusalem, there is a pool, the Sheep Pool, which is called Bethsaida in Hebrew, having five porticos.

(John 5:3) 
In these porticos was lying a great multitude of the sick, the blind, the lame, the withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

(John 5:4) 
For an angel of the Lord would descend at certain times into the pool, and the water was moved. And whoever first descended into the pool after the movement of the water was made whole from whatever illness held him.

(John 5:5) 
Now there was a certain man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.

(John 5:6) 
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been ill for a long time, He said to him: “Do you wish to be made whole?”

(John 5:7) 
The sick man answered Him: “Lord, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is moved; for while I am coming, another steps down before me.”

(John 5:8) 
Jesus said to him: “Rise, take up your bed, and walk.”

(John 5:9) 
And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the Sabbath on that day.

(John 5:10) 
The Jews therefore said to him who was healed: “It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”

(John 5:11) 
He answered them: “He who made me whole, He said to me: ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’

(John 5:12) 
They therefore asked him: “Who is that man who said to you: ‘Take up your bed, and walk?’”

(John 5:13) 
But he who had been healed did not know who it was. For Jesus had turned aside from the crowd that was standing in that place.

(John 5:14) 
After these things, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: “Behold, you are made whole; sin no more, lest something worse happen to you.”

(John 5:15) 
The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.

(John 5:16) 
And therefore the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.

(John 5:17) 
But Jesus answered them: “My Father works until now; and I work.”

(John 5:18) 
Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him: because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal to God.

(John 5:19) 
Jesus therefore answered and said to them: “Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing: for whatever He does, these things the Son also does in like manner.”

(John 5:20) 
For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does: and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.

(John 5:21) 
For just as the Father raises the dead, and gives them life: so also the Son gives life to whom He will.

(John 5:22) 
For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,

(John 5:23) 
so that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son, does not honor the Father who sent Him.

(John 5:24) 
Amen, amen, I say to you, that he who hears My word, and believes in Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.

(John 5:25) 
Amen, amen, I say to you, that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who hear will live.

(John 5:26) 
For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He gave to the Son to have life in Himself:

(John 5:27) 
and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.

(John 5:28) 
Do not marvel at this: for the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God.

(John 5:29) 
And those who have done good will come forth to the resurrection of life: but those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

(John 5:30) 
I can do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge: and My judgment is just: because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.

(John 5:31) 
If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.

(John 5:32) 
There is another who bears witness of Me: and I know that the witness which He bears of Me is true.

(John 5:33) 
You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.

(John 5:34) 
But I do not receive testimony from man: but I say these things so that you may be saved.

(John 5:35) 
He was a burning and shining lamp: and you for a time were willing to rejoice in his light.

(John 5:36) 
But I have a greater witness than John: for the works which the Father has given Me to perfect them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.

(John 5:37) 
And the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given testimony of Me: nor have you ever heard His voice, nor have you seen His form.

(John 5:38) 
And you do not have His word abiding in you: for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.

(John 5:39) 
Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life: and it is they that bear witness of Me;

(John 5:40) 
and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.

(John 5:41) 
I do not receive glory from men.

(John 5:42) 
But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.

(John 5:43) 
I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me: if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.

(John 5:44) 
How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from God alone?

(John 5:45) 
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.

(John 5:46) 
For if you believed Moses, perhaps you would believe Me also: for he wrote of Me.

(John 5:47) 
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?

(John 6:1) 
After this, Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.

(John 6:2) 
And a great crowd was following Him, because they were seeing the signs that He was performing on those who were sick.

(John 6:3) 
So Jesus went up into the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.

(John 6:4) 
Now the Passover, a feast day of the Jews, was near.

(John 6:5) 
When Jesus had lifted up His eyes, and saw that a great crowd was coming to Him, He said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?”

(John 6:6) 
Now He was saying this, testing him: for He Himself knew what He would do.

(John 6:7) 
Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each one may take a little.”

(John 6:8) 
One of His disciples, Simon Peter, said to Him:

(John 6:9) 
“There is a young boy here who has five barley loaves and two fishes: but what are these among so many?”

(John 6:10) 
Jesus therefore said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.

(John 6:11) 
Jesus therefore took the loaves: and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those sitting down: likewise also of the fishes, as much as they wanted.

(John 6:12) 
Therefore when they were filled, He said to His disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.”

(John 6:13) 
They gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over from those who had eaten.

(John 6:14) 
Those men therefore, when they had seen what sign Jesus had done, said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”

(John 6:15) 
Jesus, when He knew that they would come to seize Him and make Him king, fled again into the mountain by Himself alone.

(John 6:16) 
When evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea:

(John 6:17) 
And when they had entered into a boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum: and now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.

(John 6:18) 
And the sea was rising because a great wind was blowing.

(John 6:19) 
When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and approaching the boat: and they were afraid.

(John 6:20) 
He said to them therefore, “It is I, do not be afraid.”

(John 6:21) 
They wished therefore to take Him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.

(John 6:22) 
The next day the crowd that was standing across the sea saw that there was only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone:

(John 6:23) 
And other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, giving thanks to the Lord.

(John 6:24) 
Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they went into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

(John 6:25) 
And when they had found Him across the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”

(John 6:26) 
Jesus answered them and said, “Amen, amen I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.”

(John 6:27) 
“Labor not for the food that perishes, but for that which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For Him the Father, God, has sealed.”

(John 6:28) 
They said therefore to Him, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”

(John 6:29) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in Him Whom He has sent.”

(John 6:30) 
They said therefore to Him, “What sign then do You do, that we may see, and believe You? What do You work?”

(John 6:31) 
“Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from the sky to eat.’”

(John 6:32) 
Jesus therefore said to them: “Amen, amen I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from the sky; but My Father gives you the true bread from the sky.

(John 6:33) 
“For the bread of God is He Who comes down from the sky, and gives life to the world.”

(John 6:34) 
They said therefore to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”

(John 6:35) 
And Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall not hunger: and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.”

(John 6:36) 
“But I said to you that you have also seen Me, and you do not believe.

(John 6:37) 
“All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him who comes to Me I will not cast out.

(John 6:38) 
“For I have come down from the sky, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me.”

(John 6:39) 
“Now this is the will of Him Who sent Me: that of all that He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again on the last day.

(John 6:40) 
“For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life: and I will raise him up on the last day.”

(John 6:41) 
The Jews therefore were murmuring about Him, because He had said, “I am the living bread, Who came down from the sky.”

(John 6:42) 
And they were saying, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does He say, ‘I have come down from the sky’?”

(John 6:43) 
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves.

(John 6:44) 
“No one can come to Me, unless the Father, Who sent Me, draws him: and I will raise him up on the last day.

(John 6:45) 
“It is written in the prophets: ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ Everyone who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.

(John 6:46) 
“Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He Who is from God, He has seen the Father.

(John 6:47) 
“Amen, amen I say to you: he who believes in Me has eternal life.

(John 6:48) 
“I am the bread of life.

(John 6:49) 
“Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and they died.

(John 6:50) 
“This is the bread that comes down from the sky, so that if anyone eats of it, he will not die.

(John 6:51) 
“I am the living bread, Who came down from the sky.

(John 6:52) 
“If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, for the life of the world.”

(John 6:53) 
The Jews therefore began to quarrel among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”

(John 6:54) 
Jesus therefore said to them: “Amen, amen I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in yourselves.

(John 6:55) 
“He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life: and I will raise him up on the last day.

(John 6:56) 
“For My flesh is truly food: and My blood is truly drink.

(John 6:57) 
“He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood, abides in Me, and I in him.

(John 6:58) 
“As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father: and he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.

(John 6:59) 
“This is the bread that came down from the sky. Not as your fathers ate, and died. He who eats this bread shall live forever.”

(John 6:60) 
These things He said as He was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

(John 6:61) 
Many therefore of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, “This is a hard saying: and who can hear it?”

(John 6:62) 
But Jesus, knowing within Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, “Does this scandalize you?

(John 6:63) 
“What if you shall see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?

(John 6:64) 
“It is the Spirit that gives life: but the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

(John 6:65) 
“But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who were believing, and who would betray Him.

(John 6:66) 
And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been given to him by My Father.”

(John 6:67) 
From this time many of His disciples went back: and they were no longer walking with Him.

(John 6:68) 
Jesus therefore said to the twelve: “Do you also want to go away?”

(John 6:69) 
Simon Peter therefore answered Him: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.

(John 6:70) 
“And we believe and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

(John 6:71) 
Jesus answered them: “Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil.”

(John 7:1) 
After this, Jesus was staying in Galilee, because He didn't want to travel in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.

(John 7:2) 
Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.

(John 7:3) 
His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also can see the works you are doing.

(John 7:4) 
For nobody does anything in secret while seeking to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”

(John 7:5) 
For not even His brothers believed in Him.

(John 7:6) 
Then Jesus said to them: “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.”

(John 7:7) 
The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I bear witness of it, that its works are evil.

(John 7:8) 
Go up to this feast. I am not going up to this feast, because My time is not yet fulfilled.”

(John 7:9) 
After saying this, He remained in Galilee.

(John 7:10) 
But after His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as if in secret.

(John 7:11) 
The Jews therefore were looking for Him at the feast, and they were saying, “Where is He?”

(John 7:12) 
And there was a great murmuring about Him among the crowds. For some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “No, but He deceives the crowd.”

(John 7:13) 
Yet no one spoke openly about Him, for fear of the Jews.

(John 7:14) 
But when the feast was now half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.

(John 7:15) 
And the Jews were marveling, saying, “How does this man know letters, not having learned?”

(John 7:16) 
Jesus answered them and said: “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.

(John 7:17) 
If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak from Myself.

(John 7:18) 
The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.

(John 7:19) 
Did not Moses give you the law? And yet none of you keeps the law.

(John 7:20) 
Why are you seeking to kill Me?”

(John 7:21) 
The crowd answered, “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?”

(John 7:22) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel.

(John 7:23) 
For this reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

(John 7:24) 
If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?

(John 7:25) 
Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”

(John 7:26) 
Therefore some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is not this the man whom they are seeking to kill?

(John 7:27) 
And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers really come to know that this is truly the Christ?

(John 7:28) 
But we know where this man is from, but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.”

(John 7:29) 
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know Me and know where I am from, and I have not come from Myself, but the One who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.

(John 7:30) 
I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.”

(John 7:31) 
Therefore they were seeking to arrest Him, and no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

(John 7:32) 
But many of the crowd believed in Him, and they were saying, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than this man has done?”

(John 7:33) 
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.

(John 7:34) 
Jesus therefore said, “For a little while longer I am with you, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.

(John 7:35) 
You will seek Me, and will not find Me, and where I am, you cannot come.”

(John 7:36) 
Therefore the Jews said to one another, “Where is this man going that we will not find Him? Will He go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

(John 7:37) 
What is this statement that He said, ‘You will seek Me, and will not find Me, and where I am, you cannot come’?”

(John 7:38) 
On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.

(John 7:39) 
Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’

(John 7:40) 
But He spoke this concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him were to receive, for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

(John 7:41) 
Therefore some of the crowd, when they heard this statement, were saying, “This is truly the Prophet.”

(John 7:42) 
Others were saying, “This is the Christ.” But others were saying, “Surely the Christ does not come from Galilee, does He?

(John 7:43) 
Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”

(John 7:44) 
So there was a division in the crowd because of Him.

(John 7:45) 
Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid hands on Him.

(John 7:46) 
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”

(John 7:47) 
The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks!”

(John 7:48) 
The Pharisees answered them, “Are you also deceived?

(John 7:49) 
Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in Him?

(John 7:50) 
But this crowd, which does not know the law, is accursed.”

(John 7:51) 
Nicodemus, who had come to Him before, and who was one of them, said, “Does our law judge a man before it hears from him and knows what he is doing?”

(John 7:52) 
They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.”

(John 7:53) 
And everyone went to his home.

(John 8:1) 
Jesus then went towards the Mount of Olives.

(John 8:2) 
And in the early morning, Jesus came back to the Temple, and the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.

(John 8:3) 
But the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and they put her in the middle.

(John 8:4) 
They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.”

(John 8:5) 
Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do you say?”

(John 8:6) 
They were saying this to test Him, so that they might be able to accuse Him. But Jesus bent down and with His finger wrote on the ground.

(John 8:7) 
So when they continued asking Him, He straightened up and said to them: “Let the one of you who is without sin cast the first stone at her.”

(John 8:8) 
And again, He bent down and wrote on the ground.

(John 8:9) 
But when they heard this, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.

(John 8:10) 
When Jesus straightened up, He said to her: “Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?”

(John 8:11) 
She said: “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said: “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and sin no more.”

(John 8:12) 
Jesus spoke to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. The one who follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

(John 8:13) 
So the Pharisees said to Him: “You are bearing witness about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.”

(John 8:14) 
Jesus answered and said to them: “Even if I bear witness about Myself, My testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.

(John 8:15) 
You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.

(John 8:16) 
And if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.

(John 8:17) 
And in your law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.

(John 8:18) 
I am the one who bears witness about Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness about Me.”

(John 8:19) 
So they were saying to Him: “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would have known My Father also.”

(John 8:20) 
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, while He was teaching in the Temple. And no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.

(John 8:21) 
Then Jesus said to them again: “I am going away, and you will seek Me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”

(John 8:22) 
So the Jews were saying: “Is He going to kill Himself, because He said, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”

(John 8:23) 
And He said to them: “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.”

(John 8:24) 
Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.”

(John 8:25) 
So they were saying to Him: “Who are You?” Jesus said to them: “I AM, that is also what I am telling you.”

(John 8:26) 
“I have many things to say and to judge about you; but the One who sent Me is true, and the things that I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.”

(John 8:27) 
They did not understand that He was speaking to them about the Father.

(John 8:28) 
So Jesus said to them: “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing on My own, but I speak these things just as the Father taught Me.”

(John 8:29) 
And the One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.”

(John 8:30) 
As He spoke these things, many believed in Him.

(John 8:31) 
So Jesus was saying to the Jews who had believed in Him: “If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples.

(John 8:32) 
And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

(John 8:33) 
They answered Him: “We are Abraham’s descendants, and we have never been slaves to anyone. How do You say, ‘You will be set free’?”

(John 8:34) 
Jesus answered them: “Amen, amen I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.

(John 8:35) 
Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.

(John 8:36) 
So if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.

(John 8:37) 
I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.

(John 8:38) 
I speak the things that I have seen with My Father, and you do the things that you have heard from your father.”

(John 8:39) 
They answered and said to Him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If you are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.

(John 8:40) 
But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.

(John 8:41) 
You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him: “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.”

(John 8:42) 
So Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I did not come on My own, but He sent Me.

(John 8:43) 
Why do you not understand what I say? Because you cannot hear My word.

(John 8:44) 
You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

(John 8:45) 
But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.

(John 8:46) 
Which of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?

(John 8:47) 
He who is from God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear, because you are not from God.”

(John 8:48) 
The Jews answered Him and said: “Are we not right in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”

(John 8:49) 
Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.

(John 8:50) 
I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.

(John 8:51) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”

(John 8:52) 
So the Jews said to Him: “Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death.’

(John 8:53) 
Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Who do You make Yourself out to be?”

(John 8:54) 
Jesus answered: “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’

(John 8:55) 
You have not known Him, but I know Him. If I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar. But I know Him and I keep His word.

(John 8:56) 
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.”

(John 8:57) 
So the Jews said to Him: “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?”

(John 8:58) 
Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.”

(John 8:59) 
Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the Temple.

(John 9:1) 
As He was walking, Jesus saw a man who had been blind from birth.

(John 9:2) 
And His disciples asked Him: "Teacher, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"

(John 9:3) 
Jesus answered: "Neither this man sinned, nor his parents, but the work of God should be manifested in him."

(John 9:4) 
I must do the works of Him who sent Me, while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.

(John 9:5) 
As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.

(John 9:6) 
Having said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the spittle and spread the clay on the blind man's eyes,

(John 9:7) 
and said to him: "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means, "Sent"). Then he went and washed, and came seeing.

(John 9:8) 
Therefore the neighbors and those who had seen him before when he was begging said: "Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?"

(John 9:9) 
Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am he."

(John 9:10) 
Then they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?"

(John 9:11) 
He answered, "The Man called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: 'Go to Siloam, and wash.' And I went and washed, and I saw."

(John 9:12) 
They said to him, "Where is He?" He said, "I don't know."

(John 9:13) 
They brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.

(John 9:14) 
And it was the Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

(John 9:15) 
Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."

(John 9:16) 
Some of the Pharisees then said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a sinner do such signs?" And there was a division among them.

(John 9:17) 
Then they said again to the blind man, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?"

(John 9:18) 
He answered, "He is a prophet."

(John 9:19) 
Then the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and received sight until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.

(John 9:20) 
And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"

(John 9:21) 
His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he has come of age; let him speak for himself."

(John 9:22) 
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess that He was the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.

(John 9:23) 
For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."

(John 9:24) 
So they called the man who had been blind again and said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner."

(John 9:25) 
Then he answered and said, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see."

(John 9:26) 
Then they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"

(John 9:27) 
He answered them, "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?"

(John 9:28) 
Then they reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.

(John 9:29) 
We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this Man, we do not know where He is from."

(John 9:30) 
The man answered and said to them, "This is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!

(John 9:31) 
Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him.

(John 9:32) 
Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.

(John 9:33) 
If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing."

(John 9:34) 
They answered and said to him, "You were altogether born in sin, and are you teaching us?" And they cast him out.

(John 9:35) 
Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when He had found him, He said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"

(John 9:36) 
He answered and said, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"

(John 9:37) 
And Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is speaking with you."

(John 9:38) 
And he said, "Lord, I believe!" And he worshiped Him.

(John 9:39) 
And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."

(John 9:40) 
Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, "Are we also blind?"

(John 9:41) 
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains."

(John 10:1) 
I assure you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate but climbs in another way, he is a thief and a robber.

(John 10:2) 
But he who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

(John 10:3) 
To him the gatekeeper opens. And the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

(John 10:4) 
And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.

(John 10:5) 
A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.

(John 10:6) 
This proverb Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

(John 10:7) 
Jesus therefore said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep.

(John 10:8) 
All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

(John 10:9) 
I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.

(John 10:10) 
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.

(John 10:11) 
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

(John 10:12) 
The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf attacks them and scatters them.

(John 10:13) 
The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

(John 10:14) 
I am the good shepherd. I know my own sheep, and they know me,

(John 10:15) 
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.

(John 10:16) 
And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.

(John 10:17) 
For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.

(John 10:18) 
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”

(John 10:19) 
There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.

(John 10:20) 
Many of them were saying, “He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?”

(John 10:21) 
Others said, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

(John 10:22) 
At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,

(John 10:23) 
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon.

(John 10:24) 
So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”

(John 10:25) 
Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,

(John 10:26) 
but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.

(John 10:27) 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

(John 10:28) 
I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

(John 10:29) 
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.

(John 10:30) 
I and the Father are one.”

(John 10:31) 
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.

(John 10:32) 
Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”

(John 10:33) 
The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”

(John 10:34) 
Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I said, you are gods’?

(John 10:35) 
If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—

(John 10:36) 
do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?

(John 10:37) 
If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;

(John 10:38) 
but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”

(John 10:39) 
Again they were seeking to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.

(John 10:40) 
He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and there he remained.

(John 10:41) 
And many came to him. They said, “John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”

(John 10:42) 
And many there believed in him.

(John 11:1) 
There was a sick man: Lazarus, who was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

(John 11:2) 
Now Mary was the one who had poured perfume on the Lord and dried His feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was sick.

(John 11:3) 
So the sisters sent a message to Jesus saying, "Lord, the one You love is sick."

(John 11:4) 
When Jesus heard this, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."

(John 11:5) 
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.

(John 11:6) 
So, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained for two more days in the place where He was.

(John 11:7) 
Then after that, He said to His disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."

(John 11:8) 
The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"

(John 11:9) 
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

(John 11:10) 
But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."

(John 11:11) 
These things He said; and after that He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I am going to awaken him."

(John 11:12) 
Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well."

(John 11:13) 
However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about the repose of sleep.

(John 11:14) 
Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead."

(John 11:15) 
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. But let us go to him."

(John 11:16) 
Then Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him."

(John 11:17) 
So Jesus came and found that he had already been in the tomb for four days.

(John 11:18) 
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.

(John 11:19) 
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.

(John 11:20) 
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary remained in the house.

(John 11:21) 
Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

(John 11:22) 
But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."

(John 11:23) 
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

(John 11:24) 
Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."

(John 11:25) 
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me, though he may die, he will live.

(John 11:26) 
And whoever lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?"

(John 11:27) 
She said to Him, "Yes, Lord. I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world."

(John 11:28) 
And when she had said this, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The Master is here and is calling for you."

(John 11:29) 
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him.

(John 11:30) 
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.

(John 11:31) 
Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.

(John 11:32) 
Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."

(John 11:33) 
Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.

(John 11:34) 
and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to Him, "Lord, come and see."

(John 11:35) 
Jesus wept.

(John 11:36) 
Then the Jews said, "See how He loved him!"

(John 11:37) 
But some of them said, "Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also kept this man from dying?"

(John 11:38) 
Then Jesus, again deeply moved within Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.

(John 11:39) 
Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."

(John 11:40) 
Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?"

(John 11:41) 
So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.

(John 11:42) 
And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said it, that they may believe that You sent Me."

(John 11:43) 
Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"

(John 11:44) 
And the dead man came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let him go."

(John 11:45) 
Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him.

(John 11:46) 
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus had done.

(John 11:47) 
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, "What are we doing? For this Man works many signs.

(John 11:48) 
If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."

(John 11:49) 
And one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,

(John 11:50) 
nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."

(John 11:51) 
Now this he did not say on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,

(John 11:52) 
and not for the nation only, but that He might also gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.

(John 11:53) 
Therefore, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death.

(John 11:54) 
So Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with His disciples.

(John 11:55) 
And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.

(John 11:56) 
Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves in the temple, "What do you think—that He will not come to the feast?"

(John 11:57) 
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might arrest Him.

(John 12:1) 
Six days before Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

(John 12:2) 
They prepared a meal for him there, and Martha was serving them, while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with Him.

(John 12:3) 
Mary took a pound of pure, costly nard perfume, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and dried his feet with her hair. The house then was filled with the sweet scent of the perfume.

(John 12:4) 
Then, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray him, said,

(John 12:5) 
“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”

(John 12:6) 
He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money bag, he was taking what was put into it.

(John 12:7) 
So Jesus said: “Let her alone, so she may keep this for the day of my burial. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”

(John 12:8) 
Then, a large crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

(John 12:9) 
But the chief priests then planned to kill Lazarus too,

(John 12:10) 
because, because of him, many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus.

(John 12:11) 
The next day, the large crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

(John 12:12) 
took palm branches and went out to meet him, and they were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”

(John 12:13) 
Jesus found a donkey and sat on it, as it is written:

(John 12:14) 
“Do not fear, daughter of Zion: behold, your King comes, sitting on a colt of a donkey.”

(John 12:15) 
His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and they had done these things for him.

(John 12:16) 
The crowd that was with him then testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead.

(John 12:17) 
For this reason, the crowd went out to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.

(John 12:18) 
Then the Pharisees said to one another, “Do you see that we are accomplishing nothing? Behold, the whole world has gone after him.”

(John 12:19) 
Now there were some Greeks among those who had gone up to worship at the feast.

(John 12:20) 
These approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they were asking him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”

(John 12:21) 
Philip came and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

(John 12:22) 
Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

(John 12:23) 
Amen, amen, I say to you: unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

(John 12:24) 
Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world keeps it to eternal life.

(John 12:25) 
If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

(John 12:26) 
Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? “Father, save me from this hour.” But for this reason I have come to this hour.

(John 12:27) 
Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”

(John 12:28) 
So the crowd that stood there and heard it was saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”

(John 12:29) 
Jesus answered and said: “This voice did not come for my sake, but for yours.

(John 12:30) 
Now is the judgment of the world; now the prince of this world shall be cast out.

(John 12:31) 
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.”

(John 12:32) 
He said this, signifying by what kind of death he was going to die.

(John 12:33) 
Then the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that Christ remains forever. And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”

(John 12:34) 
Jesus then said to them: “For a little while longer, the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you, and whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.

(John 12:35) 
While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.” Jesus spoke these words, and he went away and hid himself from them.

(John 12:36) 
Although he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:

(John 12:37) 
so that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which he said: “Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”

(John 12:38) 
Therefore, they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:

(John 12:39) 
“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they might not see with their eyes, understand with their heart, and turn back, and I heal them.”

(John 12:40) 
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke about him.

(John 12:41) 
Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.

(John 12:42) 
For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.

(John 12:43) 
Then Jesus cried out and said: “He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.

(John 12:44) 
And he who sees me sees him who sent me.

(John 12:45) 
I have come as light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness.

(John 12:46) 
And if anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him, because I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

(John 12:47) 
Whoever rejects me and does not receive my words has one who judges him. The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.

(John 12:48) 
For I have not spoken on my own, but the Father who sent me has given me a commandment about what I should say and what I should speak.

(John 12:49) 
And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore, what I speak, I speak as the Father has told me.”

(John 13:1) 
Before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. And because He had loved his own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end.

(John 13:2) 
And when supper was finished, since the devil had already put it in the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Him,

(John 13:3) 
Jesus knew that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that He had come from God and was going back to God,

(John 13:4) 
He rose from supper, and laid aside his garments; and having taken a towel, He girded himself.

(John 13:5) 
Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

(John 13:6) 
Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”

(John 13:7) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know it hereafter.”

(John 13:8) 
Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.”

(John 13:9) 
Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.”

(John 13:10) 
Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”

(John 13:11) 
Jesus said to him, “He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is clean all over. And you are clean, but not all.”

(John 13:12) 
For He knew who it was that would betray Him; that is why He said, “You are not all clean.”

(John 13:13) 
When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?”

(John 13:14) 
“You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right; for so I am.”

(John 13:15) 
“If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.”

(John 13:16) 
“For I have given you an example, so that you also should do as I have done to you.”

(John 13:17) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.”

(John 13:18) 
“If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.”

(John 13:19) 
“I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’”

(John 13:20) 
“I tell you this now, before it happens, that when it does happen you may believe that I am he.”

(John 13:21) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”

(John 13:22) 
When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”

(John 13:23) 
The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he was speaking.

(John 13:24) 
One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table in Jesus' bosom.

(John 13:25) 
So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask who it was of whom he spoke.

(John 13:26) 
Then leaning back on Jesus' breast, he said to him, “Lord, who is it?”

(John 13:27) 
Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it.” So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

(John 13:28) 
After the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.”

(John 13:29) 
Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.

(John 13:30) 
Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.

(John 13:31) 
So, after receiving the morsel, he immediately went out. And it was night.

(John 13:32) 
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.”

(John 13:33) 
“If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him at once.”

(John 13:34) 
“Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.”

(John 13:35) 
“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”

(John 13:36) 
“By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

(John 13:37) 
Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterwards.”

(John 13:38) 
Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”

(John 13:39) 
Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times.”

(John 14:1) 
Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God, so believe also in me.

(John 14:2) 
My Father's house has many rooms. If it were otherwise, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?

(John 14:3) 
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also.

(John 14:4) 
And you know the way where I am going.

(John 14:5) 
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?”

(John 14:6) 
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

(John 14:7) 
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”

(John 14:8) 
Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.”

(John 14:9) 
Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

(John 14:10) 
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.

(John 14:11) 
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.

(John 14:12) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do, and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.

(John 14:13) 
Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

(John 14:14) 
If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

(John 14:15) 
“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

(John 14:16) 
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,

(John 14:17) 
even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

(John 14:18) 
“I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.

(John 14:19) 
Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.

(John 14:20) 
In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

(John 14:21) 
Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”

(John 14:22) 
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”

(John 14:23) 
Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.

(John 14:24) 
Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.

(John 14:25) 
“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you.

(John 14:26) 
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

(John 14:27) 
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, nor let them be afraid.

(John 14:28) 
You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

(John 14:29) 
And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe.

(John 14:30) 
I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. And he has nothing in me.

(John 14:31) 
But I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise up, let us go from here.

(John 15:1) 
I am the true vine, and My Father is the farmer.

(John 15:2) 
He cuts off every branch in Me that doesn't produce fruit. And the branches that bear fruit, He prunes so that it may produce more.

(John 15:3) 
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

(John 15:4) 
Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself, it must remain in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me.

(John 15:5) 
I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me and I in them produce much fruit, because apart from Me you can do nothing.

(John 15:6) 
If anyone does not remain in Me, they are thrown outside like a branch and wither. Such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.

(John 15:7) 
If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, you can ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

(John 15:8) 
My Father is glorified in this: that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.

(John 15:9) 
As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.

(John 15:10) 
If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love.

(John 15:11) 
I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.

(John 15:12) 
This is My commandment: that you love one another, as I have loved you.

(John 15:13) 
No one has greater love than this: that they lay down their life for their friends.

(John 15:14) 
You are My friends if you do what I command you.

(John 15:15) 
I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from My Father.

(John 15:16) 
You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.

(John 15:17) 
This I command you: that you love one another.

(John 15:18) 
If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you.

(John 15:19) 
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.

(John 15:20) 
Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.

(John 15:21) 
But they will do all these things to you on account of My name, because they do not know the One who sent Me.

(John 15:22) 
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

(John 15:23) 
Those who hate Me, hate My Father also.

(John 15:24) 
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and they hate both Me and My Father.

(John 15:25) 
But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their law: 'They hated Me without cause.'

(John 15:26) 
When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about Me.

(John 15:27) 
And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.

(John 16:1) 
I have told you these things so that you do not lose faith.

(John 16:2) 
They will cast you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.

(John 16:3) 
They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor Me.

(John 16:4) 
But I have told you these things so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them.

(John 16:5) 
I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you.

(John 16:6) 
Now, I am going to the One Who sent Me, and yet not one of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'

(John 16:7) 
But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.

(John 16:8) 
But I tell you the truth: It is better for you that I go, for if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you.

(John 16:9) 
And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment:

(John 16:10) 
concerning sin, because they have not believed in Me;

(John 16:11) 
concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see Me no more;

(John 16:12) 
and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

(John 16:13) 
I still have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now.

(John 16:14) 
But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak, and He will declare to you the things that are to come.

(John 16:15) 
He will glorify Me, because He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.

(John 16:16) 
All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.

(John 16:17) 
A little while, and you will see Me no longer, and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I am going to the Father.

(John 16:18) 
Some of His disciples then said to one another, “What does He mean by this that He says to us, ‘A little while, and you will see Me no longer,’ and, ‘Again a little while, and you will see Me,’ and, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”

(John 16:19) 
So they were saying, “What does He mean by ‘a little while’? We do not know what He is talking about.”

(John 16:20) 
Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him, and He said to them, “Are you discussing this among yourselves, that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me’?

(John 16:21) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.

(John 16:22) 
When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she has given birth to the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.

(John 16:23) 
So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.

(John 16:24) 
In that day, you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you.

(John 16:25) 
Until now, you have not asked for anything in My name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.

(John 16:26) 
I have spoken to you these things in figures of speech; the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly of the Father.

(John 16:27) 
In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;

(John 16:28) 
for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.

(John 16:29) 
I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.

(John 16:30) 
His disciples said, “Now You are speaking plainly and not using any figure of speech.

(John 16:31) 
Now we know that You know all things and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God.

(John 16:32) 
Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?

(John 16:33) 
Behold, the hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

(John 16:34) 
I have said these things to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

(John 17:1) 
After Jesus said these things, He looked up to the universe and said, “Father, the time has come! Glorify Your Son, so that Your Son can glorify You.

(John 17:2) 
You have already given Him authority over all people, so that He might give eternal life to all those whom You have given to Him.

(John 17:3) 
This is eternal life: that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You sent on a mission.

(John 17:4) 
I have glorified You on the earth, by accomplishing the work that You gave Me to do.

(John 17:5) 
And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence, with the glory that I had with You before the universe existed.

(John 17:6) 
I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.

(John 17:7) 
Now they know that everything You have given Me comes from You.

(John 17:8) 
For I have given them the words that You gave Me, and they have received them and truly understood that I came from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.

(John 17:9) 
I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, because they are Yours.

(John 17:10) 
All My things are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.

(John 17:11) 
I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, those whom You have given Me, so that they may be one, as We are.

(John 17:12) 
While I was with them, I kept them in Your name. I guarded those whom You gave Me, and not one of them has been lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

(John 17:13) 
But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.

(John 17:14) 
I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

(John 17:15) 
I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should protect them from evil.

(John 17:16) 
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

(John 17:17) 
Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth.

(John 17:18) 
As You sent Me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.

(John 17:19) 
And for their sakes, I sanctify Myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth.

(John 17:20) 
I do not pray for these only, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word,

(John 17:21) 
that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, so that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.

(John 17:22) 
And I have given them the glory that You have given Me, so that they may be one, just as We are one.

(John 17:23) 
I in them, and You in Me, so that they may be perfected in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me and that You have loved them, as You have loved Me.

(John 17:24) 
Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory that You have given Me, because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

(John 17:25) 
O righteous Father, the world has not known You, but I have known You, and these have known that You sent Me.

(John 17:26) 
And I have made Your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”

(John 18:1) 
After Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples across the river of Kidron. Where there was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.

(John 18:2) 
Now Judas, who was betraying him, knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples.

(John 18:3) 
Then Judas, having received a cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

(John 18:4) 
Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would happen to him, went forth and said to them, "Whom are you seeking?"

(John 18:5) 
They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am." And Judas, who was betraying him, was standing with them.

(John 18:6) 
When therefore he said to them, "I am," they went backward and fell to the ground.

(John 18:7) 
Again therefore he asked them, "Whom are you seeking?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."

(John 18:8) 
Jesus answered, "I told you that I am. If therefore you are seeking me, let these go their way."

(John 18:9) 
That the word might be fulfilled which he said: "I have not lost any of those whom you gave me."

(John 18:10) 
Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.

(John 18:11) 
Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"

(John 18:12) 
Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus,

(John 18:13) 
and bound him: and they led him to Annas first, for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.

(John 18:14) 
Now Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

(John 18:15) 
And Simon Peter was following Jesus, and another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.

(John 18:16) 
But Peter was standing at the door outside. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who kept the door, and brought Peter in.

(John 18:17) 
Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you not also one of this man’s disciples?"

(John 18:18) 
He said, "I am not."

(John 18:19) 
Now the servants and the officers were standing at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

(John 18:20) 
The high priest therefore questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.

(John 18:21) 
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have spoken nothing.

(John 18:22) 
Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I have spoken to them. Behold, they know what things I have said."

(John 18:23) 
And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with a slap, saying, "Do you answer the high priest so?"

(John 18:24) 
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?"

(John 18:25) 
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

(John 18:26) 
And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "Are you not also one of his disciples?"

(John 18:27) 
He denied it and said, "I am not."

(John 18:28) 
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was morning; and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.

(John 18:29) 
Pilate therefore went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"

(John 18:30) 
They answered and said to him, "If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to you."

(John 18:31) 
Then Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." The Jews said therefore to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."

(John 18:32) 
That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying by what death he would die.

(John 18:33) 
Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

(John 18:34) 
Jesus answered, "Do you say this of yourself, or have others told you about me?"

(John 18:35) 
Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?"

(John 18:36) 
Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."

(John 18:37) 
Pilate therefore said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."

(John 18:38) 
Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find in him no crime at all."

(John 18:39) 
But it is your custom that I should release one to you at the Passover. Will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?"

(John 18:40) 
Then they cried out again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.

(John 19:1) 
Then Pilate had Jesus flogged.

(John 19:2) 
And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns, placed it on his head, and dressed him in a purple robe.

(John 19:3) 
They approached him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck him.

(John 19:4) 
Pilate went outside again and said to them, "I am bringing him out to you so you may know that I find no fault in him."

(John 19:5) 
Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"

(John 19:6) 
When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no fault in him."

(John 19:7) 
The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."

(John 19:8) 
When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid.

(John 19:9) 
He entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.

(John 19:10) 
So Pilate said to him, "Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and power to crucify you?"

(John 19:11) 
Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."

(John 19:12) 
From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."

(John 19:13) 
When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

(John 19:14) 
It was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about noon. Pilate said to the Jews, "Here is your king!"

(John 19:15) 
They shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."

(John 19:16) 
So he handed him over to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.

(John 19:17) 
Bearing his own cross, he went out to the place called the Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

(John 19:18) 
There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.

(John 19:19) 
Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."

(John 19:20) 
Many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

(John 19:21) 
So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write 'King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.'"

(John 19:22) 
Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

(John 19:23) 
When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. The tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.

(John 19:24) 
So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be," so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots." This is what the soldiers did.

(John 19:25) 
Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

(John 19:26) 
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"

(John 19:27) 
Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.

(John 19:28) 
After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said, to fulfill the scripture, "I am thirsty."

(John 19:29) 
A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.

(John 19:30) 
When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, "It is finished." And bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.

(John 19:31) 
The Jews therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

(John 19:32) 
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.

(John 19:33) 
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

(John 19:34) 
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.

(John 19:35) 
He who saw it has borne witness, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, so that you also may believe.

(John 19:36) 
For these things happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled: "Not a bone of him will be broken."

(John 19:37) 
And again another scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."

(John 19:38) 
After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.

(John 19:39) 
Nicodemus also came, the one who had first come to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.

(John 19:40) 
So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.

(John 19:41) 
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.

(John 19:42) 
So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

(John 20:1) 
On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark. And she saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.

(John 20:2) 
She ran to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”

(John 20:3) 
Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.

(John 20:4) 
And they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.

(John 20:5) 
And stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.

(John 20:6) 
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. And he saw the linen cloths lying,

(John 20:7) 
and the napkin that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself.

(John 20:8) 
Then the other disciple, who had come first to the tomb, also went in, and he saw and believed.

(John 20:9) 
For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.

(John 20:10) 
Then the disciples went back to their homes.

(John 20:11) 
But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb,

(John 20:12) 
and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.

(John 20:13) 
And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”

(John 20:14) 
Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

(John 20:15) 
Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”

(John 20:16) 
Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).

(John 20:17) 
Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”

(John 20:18) 
Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he had said these things to her.

(John 20:19) 
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them, and said to them, “Peace be with you.”

(John 20:20) 
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.

(John 20:21) 
Jesus therefore said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.”

(John 20:22) 
And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.

(John 20:23) 
If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”

(John 20:24) 
Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.

(John 20:25) 
So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”

(John 20:26) 
Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being closed, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace be with you.”

(John 20:27) 
Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.”

(John 20:28) 
Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”

(John 20:29) 
Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

(John 20:30) 
Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;

(John 20:31) 
but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

(John 21:1) 
After these things, Jesus again showed himself to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and he showed himself in this way.

(John 21:2) 
Simon Peter was present, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.

(John 21:3) 
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We are coming with you." They went out and entered the boat, and that night they caught nothing.

(John 21:4) 
But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

(John 21:5) 
Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you any meat?" They answered him, "No."

(John 21:6) 
He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find." They cast it therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

(John 21:7) 
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord." Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girded his tunic about him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.

(John 21:8) 
But the other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits), drawing the net of fishes.

(John 21:9) 
When therefore they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

(John 21:10) 
Jesus said to them, "Bring of the fishes which you have now caught."

(John 21:11) 
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.

(John 21:12) 
Jesus says to them, "Come and dine." And none of those who were reclining dared to ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.

(John 21:13) 
And Jesus came, and took bread, and gave to them, and fish in like manner. This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.

(John 21:14) 
When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my lambs."

(John 21:15) 
He says to him again, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my lambs."

(John 21:16) 
He says to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my sheep."

(John 21:17) 
Amen, amen I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself, and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch forth your hands, and another will gird you, and lead you where you do not want to go."

(John 21:18) 
Now he said this, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he says to him, "Follow me."

(John 21:19) 
Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, "Lord, who is he that betrays you?"

(John 21:20) 
Peter therefore seeing him, says to Jesus, "Lord, and what of this man?"

(John 21:21) 
Jesus says to him, "So I will have him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."

(John 21:22) 
This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him, "He shall not die"; but, "So I will have him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"

(John 21:23) 
This is the disciple who gives testimony of these things, and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.

(John 21:24) 
But there are also many other things which Jesus did; which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.

(Acts 1:1) 
My first account, O Theophilus, described everything that Jesus began to do and to teach,

(Acts 1:2) 
until the very day when, after giving instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen through the Holy Spirit, he was taken up to Heaven.

(Acts 1:3) 
To them he also presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

(Acts 1:4) 
And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me;

(Acts 1:5) 
for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”

(Acts 1:6) 
So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”

(Acts 1:7) 
He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.

(Acts 1:8) 
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”

(Acts 1:9) 
And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.

(Acts 1:10) 
And as they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,

(Acts 1:11) 
and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”

(Acts 1:12) 
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.

(Acts 1:13) 
And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.

(Acts 1:14) 
All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

(Acts 1:15) 
In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,

(Acts 1:16) 
“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.

(Acts 1:17) 
For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.”

(Acts 1:18) 
Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.

(Acts 1:19) 
And it became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.

(Acts 1:20) 
For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and ‘May another take his office.’

(Acts 1:21) 
So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

(Acts 1:22) 
beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us—one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.”

(Acts 1:23) 
And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.

(Acts 1:24) 
And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen

(Acts 1:25) 
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”

(Acts 1:26) 
And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to the eleven apostles.

(Acts 2:1) 
When the day of Pentecost arrived, everyone was together in the same place:

(Acts 2:2) 
Then, suddenly, there was a sound that came from the sky, like a rushing, violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.

(Acts 2:3) 
Tongues, divided like flames of fire, appeared to them, and settled on each of them.

(Acts 2:4) 
All were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages, as the Holy Spirit enabled them to speak.

(Acts 2:5) 
Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under the sky.

(Acts 2:6) 
At this sound, a crowd gathered and was confused, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

(Acts 2:7) 
They were astonished and amazed, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?

(Acts 2:8) 
“And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?

(Acts 2:9) 
Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and the residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,

(Acts 2:10) 
Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the regions of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,

(Acts 2:11) 
both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs; we hear them speaking about the great works of God in our own tongues.”

(Acts 2:12) 
All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”

(Acts 2:13) 
But others, mocking, said, “They are filled with sweet wine.”

(Acts 2:14) 
Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words:

(Acts 2:15) 
“For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.

(Acts 2:16) 
“No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:

(Acts 2:17) 
‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.

(Acts 2:18) 
‘Even on my male servants and female servants in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.

(Acts 2:19) 
‘And I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below: blood, and fire, and a cloud of smoke.

(Acts 2:20) 
‘The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.

(Acts 2:21) 
‘And it will be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’

(Acts 2:22) 
“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs, which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—

(Acts 2:23) 
this man, delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.

(Acts 2:24) 
“But God raised him up, releasing him from the pains of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.

(Acts 2:25) 
“For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.

(Acts 2:26) 
‘Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover, my flesh will also dwell in hope.

(Acts 2:27) 
‘For you will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you let your Holy One see corruption.

(Acts 2:28) 
‘You made known to me the ways of life; you will fill me with joy with your presence.’

(Acts 2:29) 
“Brothers, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

(Acts 2:30) 
“Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,

(Acts 2:31) 
he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

(Acts 2:32) 
“This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.

(Acts 2:33) 
“Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.

(Acts 2:34) 
“For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand,

(Acts 2:35) 
‘until I make your enemies your footstool.’

(Acts 2:36) 
“Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”

(Acts 2:37) 
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what are we to do?”

(Acts 2:38) 
And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 2:39) 
“For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”

(Acts 2:40) 
And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.”

(Acts 2:41) 
So those who received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added.

(Acts 2:42) 
And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

(Acts 2:43) 
And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common.

(Acts 2:44) 
And all who believed were together and had all things in common.

(Acts 2:45) 
And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.

(Acts 2:46) 
And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts,

(Acts 2:47) 
praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

(Acts 3:1) 
Peter and John were going into the temple during the ninth hour of prayer.

(Acts 3:2) 
A certain man, who was lame from birth, was being carried in: they put him every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, so that he might ask for alms from those going into the temple.

(Acts 3:3) 
When he saw Peter and John beginning to enter the temple, he asked that he might receive alms.

(Acts 3:4) 
But Peter, with John, looked intently at him, saying, “Look at us.”

(Acts 3:5) 
And he paid attention to them, hoping that he would receive something from them.

(Acts 3:6) 
But Peter said, “I have neither silver nor gold, but what I have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.”

(Acts 3:7) 
And having taken him by the right hand, he raised him up. And immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.

(Acts 3:8) 
And leaping up, he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising God.

(Acts 3:9) 
And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

(Acts 3:10) 
And they recognized him as the one who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

(Acts 3:11) 
And while he was holding Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico, which is called Solomon’s, astonished.

(Acts 3:12) 
But when Peter saw this, he responded to the people: “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made this man walk?

(Acts 3:13) 
The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.

(Acts 3:14) 
But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked that a murderer be granted to you,

(Acts 3:15) 
and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.

(Acts 3:16) 
And on the basis of faith in His name, His name has strengthened this man whom you see and know. And the faith that comes through Him has given the man this complete healing in the presence of you all.

(Acts 3:17) 
And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your leaders.

(Acts 3:18) 
But God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer.

(Acts 3:19) 
Therefore, repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,

(Acts 3:20) 
so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you,

(Acts 3:21) 
whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, which God spoke about by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times.

(Acts 3:22) 
For Moses said, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to Him in everything He tells you.

(Acts 3:23) 
And it will be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from the people.”

(Acts 3:24) 
And all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.

(Acts 3:25) 
You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth will be blessed.’

(Acts 3:26) 
To you first, God, having raised up His Son, sent Him to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”

(Acts 4:1) 
While Peter and John were speaking to the crowd, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees approached them,

(Acts 4:2) 
they were angry that Peter and John were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead,

(Acts 4:3) 
and they seized them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.

(Acts 4:4) 
However, many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of men came to about five thousand.

(Acts 4:5) 
On the next day, the rulers, elders, and scribes gathered in Jerusalem:

(Acts 4:6) 
Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all those who were of the priestly race.

(Acts 4:7) 
And putting Peter and John in the middle, they questioned them: “By what power or by what name did you do this?”

(Acts 4:8) 
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Leaders of the people and elders,

(Acts 4:9) 
if we are being examined today about a good deed done to a weak man, and by what means he was healed,

(Acts 4:10) 
then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead, that this man is standing before you healed.

(Acts 4:11) 
This is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, and has become the cornerstone:

(Acts 4:12) 
And there is salvation in no one else, because there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”

(Acts 4:13) 
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

(Acts 4:14) 
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

(Acts 4:15) 
But when they had ordered them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying:

(Acts 4:16) 
“What are we going to do with these men? For a notable sign has been done through them, which is obvious to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.

(Acts 4:17) 
But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them that they speak no more to anyone in this name.”

(Acts 4:18) 
So they called them and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.

(Acts 4:19) 
But Peter and John answered them, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God.

(Acts 4:20) 
For we cannot help but speak about what we have seen and heard.”

(Acts 4:21) 
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, because they could not find any way to punish them, on account of the people, because all were glorifying God for what had been done.

(Acts 4:22) 
For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was over forty years old.

(Acts 4:23) 
When they were released, they went to their own people and reported everything that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.

(Acts 4:24) 
And when they heard it, with one accord they raised their voices to God and said: “Lord, you are the one who made the universe, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.

(Acts 4:25) 
By the Holy Spirit you said through the mouth of our father David, your servant: ‘Why did the nations rage, and the peoples devise empty things?

(Acts 4:26) 
The kings of the earth rose up, and the rulers gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.’

(Acts 4:27) 
For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,

(Acts 4:28) 
to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to happen.

(Acts 4:29) 
And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,

(Acts 4:30) 
while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”

(Acts 4:31) 
And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.

(Acts 4:32) 
Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that anything of what he possessed was his own, but they held everything in common.

(Acts 4:33) 
And with great power the apostles gave testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.

(Acts 4:34) 
For there was not anyone needy among them, because all who owned land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,

(Acts 4:35) 
and laid it at the apostles’ feet. And distribution was made to each as any had need.

(Acts 4:36) 
Now Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,

(Acts 4:37) 
having a field, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

(Acts 5:1) 
Then Peter rose up and said, “Brothers, listen. God chose me to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, so they could hear and believe.”

(Acts 5:2) 
And God, who knows the mind and heart of every man, also gave the Holy Spirit to them, just as He did to us,

(Acts 5:3) 
making no distinction between us, since He purified their hearts through faith.

(Acts 5:4) 
So, why do you now put God to the test, placing a burden on the necks of these disciples which neither we nor our fathers have been able to carry?

(Acts 5:5) 
But we believe it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, as they are.”

(Acts 5:6) 
And all the assembly of the apostles remained silent. They were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they told of the wonders and signs God had worked through them among the Gentiles.

(Acts 5:7) 
After they were done speaking, James addressed the assembly, saying, “Brothers, listen to me.

(Acts 5:8) 
Simeon has related how God first showed His concern by gathering a people for his own name out of the Gentiles.

(Acts 5:9) 
And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:

(Acts 5:10) 
“After this I will return and rebuild the fallen house of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,

(Acts 5:11) 
so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, including all the Gentiles over whom my name has been proclaimed.”

(Acts 5:12) 
God has shown us this from the beginning of the world.

(Acts 5:13) 
Therefore, it is my judgment that we should not make it difficult for those Gentiles who are turning to God,

(Acts 5:14) 
but we should instead write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from unlawful marriage, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.

(Acts 5:15) 
For from ancient times Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town, as he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”

(Acts 5:16) 
Then the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, decided to send men chosen from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.

(Acts 5:17) 
They sent the following letter by their hand: “The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, who are Gentiles: Greetings.

(Acts 5:18) 
We have heard that some of us went out from us without our authorization. They troubled your souls with what they said and upset you, telling you that you must be circumcised and keep the law. We gave them no such instructions.

(Acts 5:19) 
So we all agreed to choose men to send to you, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

(Acts 5:20) 
men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Acts 5:21) 
We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.

(Acts 5:22) 
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to place no further burden on you than these essential things:

(Acts 5:23) 
that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.”

(Acts 5:24) 
So they left, went down to Antioch, and gathered the whole assembly. Then they delivered the letter.

(Acts 5:25) 
When they read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement it provided.

(Acts 5:26) 
Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.

(Acts 5:27) 
After they spent some time there, they were sent off with peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.

(Acts 5:28) 
But Silas decided to remain there.

(Acts 5:29) 
Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.

(Acts 5:30) 
After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the brothers in every town where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.”

(Acts 5:31) 
Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them.

(Acts 5:32) 
But Paul didn’t think it was right to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and hadn’t accompanied them in their work.

(Acts 5:33) 
There was a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed to Cyprus.

(Acts 5:34) 
Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of God.

(Acts 5:35) 
He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

(Acts 6:1) 
Now, in those days, as the number of disciples grew, a complaint arose among the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.

(Acts 6:2) 
The Twelve summoned the whole group of disciples and said: “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.

(Acts 6:3) 
Therefore, brothers, select seven men from among you, of good repute, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint for this task.

(Acts 6:4) 
But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

(Acts 6:5) 
This proposal pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.

(Acts 6:6) 
These they presented to the apostles, and after they prayed, they laid their hands on them.

(Acts 6:7) 
And the word of God continued to spread. The number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.

(Acts 6:8) 
Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people.

(Acts 6:9) 
But some of those who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.

(Acts 6:10) 
And they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.

(Acts 6:11) 
Then they secretly instigated men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”

(Acts 6:12) 
And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council.

(Acts 6:13) 
They set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.

(Acts 6:14) 
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.”

(Acts 6:15) 
And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

(Acts 7:1) 
The high priest then said: “Are these things so?”

(Acts 7:2) 
And Stephen said: "Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he went to live in Charran.

(Acts 7:3) 
And God said to him: 'Leave your land and your family, and come to the land that I will show you.'

(Acts 7:4) 
Then Abraham went out from the land of the Chaldeans, and lived in Charran. And from there, after his father died, God brought him into this land, where you now live.

(Acts 7:5) 
And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of land. But God promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though Abraham had no son then.

(Acts 7:6) 
And God spoke: 'His descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, and they will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.'

(Acts 7:7) 
'But I will judge the nation that they will serve,' God said. 'And after that, they will come out and serve Me in this place.'

(Acts 7:8) 
And God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham fathered Isaac, and Abraham circumcised Isaac on the eighth day. And Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the twelve patriarchs.

(Acts 7:9) 
And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt, but God was with him,

(Acts 7:10) 
and rescued him from all his tribulations. And God gave Joseph favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Pharaoh made Joseph governor over Egypt and over all his household.

(Acts 7:11) 
Now a famine came upon all of Egypt and Canaan, and there was great hardship, and our fathers could not find food.

(Acts 7:12) 
But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there first.

(Acts 7:13) 
And on the second trip, Joseph was recognized by his brothers, and Joseph's family was revealed to Pharaoh.

(Acts 7:14) 
So Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and for his whole family, seventy-five people in all.

(Acts 7:15) 
So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he died there, as did our fathers.

(Acts 7:16) 
And they were brought back to Shechem, and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor, the son of Shechem.

(Acts 7:17) 
But as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

(Acts 7:18) 
until another king arose in Egypt, who did not know Joseph.

(Acts 7:19) 
This king, scheming against our race, mistreated our fathers, and forced them to abandon their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.

(Acts 7:20) 
It was at this time that Moses was born, and he was pleasing to God. And Moses was nourished for three months in his father's house.

(Acts 7:21) 
But when Moses was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and raised him as her own son.

(Acts 7:22) 
And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and in his deeds.

(Acts 7:23) 
Now when Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.

(Acts 7:24) 
And when he saw one of them being wronged, Moses defended him, and avenged the one who was being oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.

(Acts 7:25) 
Moses thought that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.

(Acts 7:26) 
And on the next day Moses appeared to them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! Why do you wrong each other?'

(Acts 7:27) 
But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?'

(Acts 7:28) 
'Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'

(Acts 7:29) 
Then Moses fled at this word, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.

(Acts 7:30) 
And when forty years were completed, an Angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire from a bush.

(Acts 7:31) 
When Moses saw the vision, he marveled at it. And as he approached to examine it, the voice of the Lord came to him,

(Acts 7:32) 
'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' But Moses, trembling, did not dare to consider it.

(Acts 7:33) 
And the Lord said to him: 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.'

(Acts 7:34) 
'I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'

(Acts 7:35) 
This Moses, whom they rejected, saying: 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?' God sent Moses as both a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.

(Acts 7:36) 
Moses led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.

(Acts 7:37) 
This is that Moses who said to the sons of Israel: 'God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brothers, just like me.'

(Acts 7:38) 
This is the Moses who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; Moses received living words to give to us.

(Acts 7:39) 
But our fathers would not obey Moses. They rejected him, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,

(Acts 7:40) 
saying to Aaron: 'Make us gods to go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'

(Acts 7:41) 
And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands.

(Acts 7:42) 
But God turned away from them and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?'

(Acts 7:43) 
'And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Remphan, the images that you made to worship. So I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'

(Acts 7:44) 
Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as He who spoke to Moses directed, so that Moses should make it according to the pattern he had seen.

(Acts 7:45) 
Our fathers, in turn, brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before our fathers, until the days of David.

(Acts 7:46) 
David found favor in the sight of God, and he asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

(Acts 7:47) 
But it was Solomon who built a house for God.

(Acts 7:48) 
However, the Most High does not dwell in buildings made by hands, as the prophet says:

(Acts 7:49) 
'Heaven is My throne, and earth is the footstool of My feet. What house will you build for Me?' says the Lord, 'or what is the place of My rest?'

(Acts 7:50) 
'Has not My hand made all these things?'

(Acts 7:51) 
You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.

(Acts 7:52) 
Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become the betrayers and murderers.

(Acts 7:53) 
You received the law as delivered by angels, and you did not keep it.

(Acts 7:54) 
Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.

(Acts 7:55) 
But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into the universe, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

(Acts 7:56) 
And Stephen said: "Behold, I see the sky opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God."

(Acts 7:57) 
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him together,

(Acts 7:58) 
and they cast him out of the city and began to stone him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

(Acts 7:59) 
And they were stoning Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."

(Acts 7:60) 
And he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.

(Acts 8:1) 
Saul approved of the killing of Stephen. A great persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem that very day, and all the Christians were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria—except for the apostles, who stayed in Jerusalem.

(Acts 8:2) 
Some devout men buried Stephen, and they mourned for him.

(Acts 8:3) 
Saul ravaged the Church, entering house after house, dragging off both men and women, and putting them in prison.

(Acts 8:4) 
So those who had been scattered went about preaching the good news of God.

(Acts 8:5) 
Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.

(Acts 8:6) 
The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, because they were united in listening to him and seeing the miracles that he was performing.

(Acts 8:7) 
For unclean spirits, crying out loudly, came out of many who were possessed by them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured.

(Acts 8:8) 
So there was great joy in that city.

(Acts 8:9) 
Now a certain man named Simon had previously practiced magic in the city of Samaria and had amazed the Samaritan people. He claimed to be someone great,

(Acts 8:10) 
and all the people, from the least to the greatest, listened to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called ‘the Great Power.’”

(Acts 8:11) 
They were devoted to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.

(Acts 8:12) 
But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news about the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

(Acts 8:13) 
Even Simon himself believed. And after he was baptized, he stayed close to Philip. When he saw the signs and great miracles that were being performed, he was amazed.

(Acts 8:14) 
Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.

(Acts 8:15) 
When they arrived, they prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 8:16) 
The Spirit had not yet come down on any of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 8:17) 
Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 8:18) 
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,

(Acts 8:19) 
saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 8:20) 
But Peter replied, “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!

(Acts 8:21) 
You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.

(Acts 8:22) 
Repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, your heart’s intent may be forgiven.

(Acts 8:23) 
For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.”

(Acts 8:24) 
Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”

(Acts 8:25) 
So when they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.

(Acts 8:26) 
Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This road is desolate.)

(Acts 8:27) 
So he got up and went. There he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of her entire treasury. This man had come to Jerusalem to worship,

(Acts 8:28) 
and he was returning home; he was sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.

(Acts 8:29) 
Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”

(Acts 8:30) 
So Philip ran up to him and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”

(Acts 8:31) 
He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

(Acts 8:32) 
Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.

(Acts 8:33) 
In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who will tell of his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”

(Acts 8:34) 
The eunuch replied to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about? Is it about himself or about someone else?”

(Acts 8:35) 
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this passage, he preached the good news about Jesus to him.

(Acts 8:36) 
And as they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?”

(Acts 8:37) 
And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”

(Acts 8:38) 
Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.

(Acts 8:39) 
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.

(Acts 8:40) 
But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through the region, he proclaimed the good news in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.

(Acts 9:1) 
Meanwhile, Saul was still threatening the Lord’s disciples. He wanted to kill them, so he went to the high priest,

(Acts 9:2) 
and asked for letters to the synagogues in Damascus. He wanted to arrest any men or women who followed the Way of Jesus, so that he could bring them to Jerusalem in chains.

(Acts 9:3) 
As he was traveling and nearing Damascus, suddenly a light shone from the sky all around him.

(Acts 9:4) 
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”

(Acts 9:5) 
Saul asked, “Who are you, Lord?” The voice replied, “I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.

(Acts 9:6) 
Now get up and go into the city, where you will be told what you must do.”

(Acts 9:7) 
The men traveling with him stood speechless. They heard the voice, but they could not see anyone.

(Acts 9:8) 
Saul got up from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.

(Acts 9:9) 
He could not see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank.

(Acts 9:10) 
In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, “Ananias.” Ananias answered, “Here I am, Lord.”

(Acts 9:11) 
The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight. Ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul. He is praying,

(Acts 9:12) 
and he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he can see again.”

(Acts 9:13) 
Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.

(Acts 9:14) 
He has received authority from the chief priests to arrest everyone who calls on your name.”

(Acts 9:15) 
But the Lord said to him, “Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.

(Acts 9:16) 
I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”

(Acts 9:17) 
Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. He placed his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 9:18) 
Immediately something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,

(Acts 9:19) 
and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul stayed with the disciples in Damascus for some days.

(Acts 9:20) 
Immediately he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.

(Acts 9:21) 
All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t this the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”

(Acts 9:22) 
Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.

(Acts 9:23) 
After many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,

(Acts 9:24) 
but Saul learned of their plan. They were watching the city gates day and night in order to kill him.

(Acts 9:25) 
But his followers helped him escape during the night by lowering him in a basket through an opening in the wall.

(Acts 9:26) 
When Saul came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.

(Acts 9:27) 
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.

(Acts 9:28) 
So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.

(Acts 9:29) 
He talked and debated with the Hellenists, but they tried to kill him.

(Acts 9:30) 
When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.

(Acts 9:31) 
Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.

(Acts 9:32) 
As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda.

(Acts 9:33) 
There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.

(Acts 9:34) 
Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up,

(Acts 9:35) 
and all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him. And many turned to the Lord.

(Acts 9:36) 
In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.

(Acts 9:37) 
About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.

(Acts 9:38) 
Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”

(Acts 9:39) 
Peter went with them, and when he arrived, he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.

(Acts 9:40) 
Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.

(Acts 9:41) 
He gave her his hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.

(Acts 9:42) 
This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.

(Acts 9:43) 
Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.

(Acts 10:1) 
There was a certain man in Caesarea, whose name was Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort which is called the Italian,

(Acts 10:2) 
a religious man, and one that feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and always praying to God.

(Acts 10:3) 
This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him: Cornelius.

(Acts 10:4) 
And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord?

(Acts 10:5) 
And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.

(Acts 10:6) 
And now send men to Joppe, and call for one Simon who is surnamed Peter:

(Acts 10:7) 
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.

(Acts 10:8) 
And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius was departed, he called two of his servants, and a soldier that was religious, of them that were with him,

(Acts 10:9) 
To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.

(Acts 10:10) 
And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey, and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.

(Acts 10:11) 
And being hungry, he was desirous to taste something. And whilst they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind:

(Acts 10:12) 
And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners to the earth,

(Acts 10:13) 
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air.

(Acts 10:14) 
And there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

(Acts 10:15) 
But Peter said: Far be it from me; for I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean.

(Acts 10:16) 
And the voice came again to him the second time: That which God hath made clean, do not thou call common.

(Acts 10:17) 
And this was done thrice: and incontinently the vessel was taken up into heaven.

(Acts 10:18) 
And as Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's house, stood at the gate.

(Acts 10:19) 
And when they had called, they asked if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

(Acts 10:20) 
And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men seek thee.

(Acts 10:21) 
Arise, therefore, and go down, and do not hesitate to go with them: for I have sent them.

(Acts 10:22) 
Then Peter, going down to the men, said: Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the cause for which you are come?

(Acts 10:23) 
Who said: Cornelius, the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and that hath good testimony from all the nation of the Jews, received an answer from God by a holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.

(Acts 10:24) 
Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following, he arose and went with them: and some of the brethren from Joppe accompanied him.

(Acts 10:25) 
And the next day they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and special friends.

(Acts 10:26) 
And it came to pass that when Peter was come in, Cornelius came to meet him, and fell down and worshipped him.

(Acts 10:27) 
But Peter lifted him up, saying: Arise, I myself also am a man.

(Acts 10:28) 
And as he was talking with him, he went in, and found many that were come together:

(Acts 10:29) 
And he said to them: You know how unlawful it is for a man that is a Jew, to keep company or to come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed to me, not to call any man common or unclean.

(Acts 10:30) 
Therefore I came without any doubt, being sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause have you sent for me?

(Acts 10:31) 
And Cornelius said: Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and I prayed in my house at the ninth hour, and behold a man stood before me in white clothing, and said:

(Acts 10:32) 
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are in remembrance in the sight of God.

(Acts 10:33) 
Send therefore to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.

(Acts 10:34) 
Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore are we all here present in thy sight, to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by God.

(Acts 10:35) 
And Peter opening his mouth, said: In very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons:

(Acts 10:36) 
But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh justice, is acceptable to him.

(Acts 10:37) 
God sent the Son to the children of Israel, to announce peace through Jesus Christ: (he is the Lord of all things).

(Acts 10:38) 
You know what happened, the Word spoken throughout all Judea. It all started in Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed.

(Acts 10:39) 
The mission of Jesus from Nazareth: How God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he passed by doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.

(Acts 10:40) 
And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem: whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.

(Acts 10:41) 
Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,

(Acts 10:42) 
Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose again from the dead:

(Acts 10:43) 
And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.

(Acts 10:44) 
To him all the prophets give testimony, that through his name all receive remission of sins, who believe in him.

(Acts 10:45) 
While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.

(Acts 10:46) 
And they of the circumcision, who believed, were astonished at them that were come with Peter, because that the grace of the Holy Ghost was also poured out upon the Gentiles.

(Acts 10:47) 
For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:

(Acts 10:48) 
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

(Acts 10:49) 
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then they besought him to tarry with them some days.

(Acts 11:1) 
The apostles and the brothers and sisters throughout Judea then heard that the Gentiles had received the word of God.

(Acts 11:2) 
When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision began to argue with him,

(Acts 11:3) 
saying, "Why did you go in to uncircumcised men and eat with them?"

(Acts 11:4) 
Peter then began to explain the matter to them in order.

(Acts 11:5) 
He said, "I was in the city of Joppa, praying; and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain vessel descended, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came even to me.

(Acts 11:6) 
In this vision I looked and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild animals, and creeping things, and the birds of the sky.

(Acts 11:7) 
And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'

(Acts 11:8) 
But I said, 'Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'

(Acts 11:9) 
But the voice answered again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed, do not you call common.'

(Acts 11:10) 
Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.

(Acts 11:11) 
And behold, immediately three men stood before the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.

(Acts 11:12) 
And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. And these six brothers went with me also, and we entered into the man's house.

(Acts 11:13) 
And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa and get Simon, who is called Peter,'

(Acts 11:14) 
who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'

(Acts 11:15) 
And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us in the beginning.

(Acts 11:16) 
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'

(Acts 11:17) 
If then God gave the same gift to them as to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?

(Acts 11:18) 
When they heard these things, they held their peace and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life."

(Acts 11:19) 
Now they who were scattered by the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except the Jews only.

(Acts 11:20) 
But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 11:21) 
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

(Acts 11:22) 
Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

(Acts 11:23) 
When he had come and seen the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.

(Acts 11:24) 
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great number of people were added to the Lord.

(Acts 11:25) 
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul.

(Acts 11:26) 
And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great number of people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

(Acts 11:27) 
And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

(Acts 11:28) 
Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there would be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.

(Acts 11:29) 
Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.

(Acts 11:30) 
This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

(Acts 12:1) 
At that same time, Herod the king had some members of the Church arrested.

(Acts 12:2) 
He killed James, the brother of John, with a sword.

(Acts 12:3) 
When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he had Peter arrested as well. This happened during the days of Unleavened Bread.

(Acts 12:4) 
Having arrested him, he put him in prison, entrusting him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him before the people after the Passover.

(Acts 12:5) 
So Peter was kept in prison, but the Church was praying to God for him, constantly.

(Acts 12:6) 
The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards were in front of the door, guarding the prison.

(Acts 12:7) 
Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly!" And the chains fell from his hands.

(Acts 12:8) 
The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and put on your sandals." And he did so. The angel said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."

(Acts 12:9) 
Peter went out and followed him, though he didn't know that what the angel was doing was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.

(Acts 12:10) 
They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them on its own. They went out and walked along one street, and then the angel left him.

(Acts 12:11) 
Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod and from everything the Jewish people were hoping for."

(Acts 12:12) 
When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people were gathered and praying.

(Acts 12:13) 
Peter knocked at the door, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it.

(Acts 12:14) 
Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the door, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the door.

(Acts 12:15) 
They said to her, "You're out of your mind." But she insisted that it was true. They said, "It must be his angel."

(Acts 12:16) 
But Peter kept knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.

(Acts 12:17) 
He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers about this," he said, and then he left and went to another place.

(Acts 12:18) 
In the morning, there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter.

(Acts 12:19) 
After Herod had a thorough search for him and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

(Acts 12:20) 
Herod was furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they came to him in a body. After getting Blastus, the king's personal aide, on their side, they asked for peace, because their country depended on Herod's country for its food supply.

(Acts 12:21) 
On the appointed day, Herod, wearing royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a speech to them.

(Acts 12:22) 
The crowd began to shout, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man."

(Acts 12:23) 
Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, the angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

(Acts 12:24) 
But the Word of the Lord continued to spread and flourish.

(Acts 12:25) 
Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after completing their mission, taking John, also called Mark, with them.

(Acts 13:1) 
Now in the Church that was in Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who was brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

(Acts 13:2) 
As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”

(Acts 13:3) 
Then, after they had fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them away.

(Acts 13:4) 
So they, being sent on a mission by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

(Acts 13:5) 
And when they came to Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John in their ministry.

(Acts 13:6) 
And when they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,

(Acts 13:7) 
who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and was eager to hear the word of God.

(Acts 13:8) 
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is the meaning of his name) was resisting them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

(Acts 13:9) 
But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looking intently at him,

(Acts 13:10) 
said: “O full of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord?

(Acts 13:11) 
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

(Acts 13:12) 
Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

(Acts 13:13) 
Now when Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos, they came to Pamphylia, to Perga. And John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.

(Acts 13:14) 
But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and on the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.

(Acts 13:15) 
After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Men, brothers, if there is any word of exhortation for the people, speak.”

(Acts 13:16) 
Then Paul stood up and, motioning with his hand, said: “Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.

(Acts 13:17) 
The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he led them out of it,

(Acts 13:18) 
and for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.

(Acts 13:19) 
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their land to them by lot,

(Acts 13:20) 
as it were, for about four hundred and fifty years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.

(Acts 13:21) 
And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

(Acts 13:22) 
And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he bore witness and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’

(Acts 13:23) 
From the offspring of this man, according to the promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,

(Acts 13:24) 
before whose coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

(Acts 13:25) 
And as John was finishing his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not the one. But behold, one comes after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.’

(Acts 13:26) 
“Men, brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation has been sent.

(Acts 13:27) 
For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him, nor understand the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these prophecies by condemning him.

(Acts 13:28) 
And though they found in him no cause for death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.

(Acts 13:29) 
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.

(Acts 13:30) 
But God raised him from the dead on the third day.

(Acts 13:31) 
And for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.

(Acts 13:32) 
And we bring you good news of the promise that was made to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this promise to their children by raising up Jesus,

(Acts 13:33) 
as it is also written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’

(Acts 13:34) 
And that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’

(Acts 13:35) 
Therefore he says also in another place, ‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’

(Acts 13:36) 
For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,

(Acts 13:37) 
but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.

(Acts 13:38) 
Let it be known to you therefore, men, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

(Acts 13:39) 
and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

(Acts 13:40) 
Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the prophets should come about:

(Acts 13:41) 
“Look, you scoffers, and wonder and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.”

(Acts 13:42) 
As they went out, they begged that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.

(Acts 13:43) 
And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.

(Acts 13:44) 
The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of God.

(Acts 13:45) 
But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.

(Acts 13:46) 
And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.

(Acts 13:47) 
For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’

(Acts 13:48) 
And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.

(Acts 13:49) 
And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.

(Acts 13:50) 
But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.

(Acts 13:51) 
But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.

(Acts 13:52) 
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 14:1) 
In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas continued to enter into the synagogue. They preached, and a large multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.

(Acts 14:2) 
But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.

(Acts 14:3) 
Paul and Barnabas remained there a long time, speaking boldly, trusting in the Lord. God’s grace caused them to speak in power and perform miracles.

(Acts 14:4) 
The city was divided. Some sided with the Jews, but others sided with the Apostles.

(Acts 14:5) 
When both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, violently attacked the Apostles, intending to abuse them and stone them...

(Acts 14:6) 
...they fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia and all the surrounding region.

(Acts 14:7) 
They continued to preach there the Gospel.

(Acts 14:8) 
In Lystra, there was a man sitting who was crippled in his feet. He had been lame from birth, and had never walked.

(Acts 14:9) 
He listened to Paul speaking. Paul looked at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,

(Acts 14:10) 
said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" And he leaped up and began to walk.

(Acts 14:11) 
When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, saying, “The gods have come down to us, in the likeness of men!”

(Acts 14:12) 
They called Barnabas “Jupiter,” and Paul “Mercury,” because Paul was the chief speaker.

(Acts 14:13) 
The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, and with the crowds, wanted to offer sacrifice.

(Acts 14:14) 
But when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting:

(Acts 14:15) 
“Men, why are you doing this? We are also mortals, like you. We are preaching so that you turn from these empty things and come to the living God, who created the universe and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.

(Acts 14:16) 
In generations past, he allowed all the Gentiles to follow their own ways.

(Acts 14:17) 
Yet he did not leave himself without a witness. He did good, giving you rain from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and joy.

(Acts 14:18) 
Even saying these things, it was barely enough to restrain the crowds from sacrificing to them.

(Acts 14:19) 
Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and they persuaded the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

(Acts 14:20) 
But when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went back into the city. The next day, he went with Barnabas to Derbe.

(Acts 14:21) 
After preaching the Gospel to that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

(Acts 14:22) 
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith, because we must endure many tribulations to enter into the Kingdom of God.

(Acts 14:23) 
Then they appointed presbyters for them in each church, with prayer and fasting, and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

(Acts 14:24) 
Then, after passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

(Acts 14:25) 
After they spoke the word of the Lord in Perga, they went down to Attalia,

(Acts 14:26) 
and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.

(Acts 14:27) 
When they arrived, and gathered the Church, they reported all the things God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

(Acts 14:28) 
They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.

(Acts 15:1) 
Certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brothers: “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”

(Acts 15:2) 
When there was no small dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas against them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to the apostles and priests in Jerusalem, about this question.

(Acts 15:3) 
They therefore, having been led forward by the Church, were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria, narrating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they were making great joy to all the brothers.

(Acts 15:4) 
When they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the Church and the apostles and priests, announcing how great a thing God had done with them.

(Acts 15:5) 
Certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees, who had believed, rose up, saying: “It is necessary to circumcise them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”

(Acts 15:6) 
The apostles and the elders assembled to consider the word about this.

(Acts 15:7) 
When there was much debate, Peter rose up and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that from the ancient days God chose among us, that the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel by my mouth, and believe.”

(Acts 15:8) 
And God, who knows the hearts, bore witness, giving to them the Holy Spirit, just as to us:

(Acts 15:9) 
And He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

(Acts 15:10) 
Now therefore why are you tempting God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we could bear?

(Acts 15:11) 
But through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe that we shall be saved, in the same way as they also [shall be saved].

(Acts 15:12) 
Then all the multitude fell silent: and they listened to Barnabas and Paul, relating how great signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.

(Acts 15:13) 
And after they were silent, James answered, saying: “Men, brothers, hear me.

(Acts 15:14) 
Simon has recounted how God first visited, taking from the Gentiles a holy people for His name.

(Acts 15:15) 
And with this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:

(Acts 15:16) 
“After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David that has fallen: and I will rebuild its ruins, and I will raise it up:

(Acts 15:17) 
so that the rest of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My name is called, says the Lord, who does these things.”

(Acts 15:18) 
Known from the beginning is His work with God.

(Acts 15:19) 
Wherefore I judge that those who are converted to God from the Gentiles should not be disturbed,

(Acts 15:20) 
but that they should write to them that they abstain from the contaminations of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

(Acts 15:21) 
For Moses, from the generations of old, has in every city those who preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every Sabbath.

(Acts 15:22) 
Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole Church, to choose men from among themselves, and to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, Judas, who was called Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.

(Acts 15:23) 
Writing by their hands: “The apostles and the elder brothers to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers from the Gentiles, greeting.”

(Acts 15:24) 
“Because we have heard that certain ones, who went out from among us, have disturbed you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we did not give any command:

(Acts 15:25) 
it has pleased us, gathered together in one place, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

(Acts 15:26) 
men who have delivered their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Acts 15:27) 
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who also will tell you the same things.”

(Acts 15:28) 
“For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to impose upon you no further burden than these necessary things:

(Acts 15:29) 
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication: from which keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Farewell.”

(Acts 15:30) 
So they, having been dismissed, went to Antioch: and gathering the multitude together, they delivered the letter.

(Acts 15:31) 
When they had read it, they rejoiced over the consolation.

(Acts 15:32) 
Judas and Silas, they also being prophets, with many words exhorted the brothers, and they strengthened them.

(Acts 15:33) 
And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed with peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.

(Acts 15:34) 
But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.

(Acts 15:35) 
But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and evangelizing with many others the word of the Lord.

(Acts 15:36) 
After some days, Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us return and visit the brothers through all the cities in which we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”

(Acts 15:37) 
And Barnabas wanted to take with them also John, who was called Mark.

(Acts 15:38) 
But Paul was asking him not to take this one with them, who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.

(Acts 15:39) 
There was a disagreement, so that they departed from each other, and Barnabas, taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus:

(Acts 15:40) 
But Paul, having chosen Silas, set out, having been delivered to the grace of God by the brothers.

(Acts 15:41) 
And he was going through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the Apostles and elders.

(Acts 16:1) 
Paul next traveled to Derbe and Lystra. There was a disciple named Timothy there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, and his father was a Gentile.

(Acts 16:2) 
The brothers at Lystra and Iconium gave a good report of him.

(Acts 16:3) 
Paul wanted Timothy to go with him. He had Timothy circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Gentile.

(Acts 16:4) 
As they traveled from town to town, they passed along the decisions that had been made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, and the new churches obeyed these commands.

(Acts 16:5) 
So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

(Acts 16:6) 
Then they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian regions, being prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.

(Acts 16:7) 
When they came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

(Acts 16:8) 
So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.

(Acts 16:9) 
During the night, Paul had a vision. A man of Macedonia was standing and begging him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”

(Acts 16:10) 
As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we immediately tried to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

(Acts 16:11) 
Setting sail from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.

(Acts 16:12) 
From there we went to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days.

(Acts 16:13) 
On the Sabbath, we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we thought there would be a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there.

(Acts 16:14) 
A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, was listening. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what Paul said.

(Acts 16:15) 
After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she compelled us.

(Acts 16:16) 
One day as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling.

(Acts 16:17) 
Following Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.”

(Acts 16:18) 
And she kept doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.

(Acts 16:19) 
But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the marketplace before the authorities.

(Acts 16:20) 
And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are disturbing our city. They are Jews,

(Acts 16:21) 
and are proclaiming customs that are not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”

(Acts 16:22) 
The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.

(Acts 16:23) 
And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.

(Acts 16:24) 
Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.

(Acts 16:25) 
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.

(Acts 16:26) 
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bonds were unfastened.

(Acts 16:27) 
When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

(Acts 16:28) 
But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”

(Acts 16:29) 
And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas.

(Acts 16:30) 
Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”

(Acts 16:31) 
And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”

(Acts 16:32) 
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

(Acts 16:33) 
And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds; and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.

(Acts 16:34) 
Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.

(Acts 16:35) 
But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police to say, “Release those men.”

(Acts 16:36) 
And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore, come out now and go in peace.”

(Acts 16:37) 
But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly without a trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are secretly sending us away? No, let them come themselves and

(Acts 16:38) 
take us out.”

(Acts 16:39) 
The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.

(Acts 16:40) 
So they came and apologized to them. And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city.

(Acts 16:41) 
So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.

(Acts 17:1) 
After Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived in Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.

(Acts 17:2) 
Paul then went into the synagogue, as was his custom. For three Sabbaths, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

(Acts 17:3) 
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer, and to rise again from the dead. And he said, "This Jesus whom I announce to you is the Christ."

(Acts 17:4) 
Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of Gentile converts and many prominent women.

(Acts 17:5) 
But the Jews were jealous, and they gathered wicked men from the marketplace, and stirred up the city. They attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.

(Acts 17:6) 
Not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here too,

(Acts 17:7) 
and Jason has received them. They are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."

(Acts 17:8) 
They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.

(Acts 17:9) 
After taking security from Jason and the others, they let them go.

(Acts 17:10) 
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.

(Acts 17:11) 
These Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, because they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

(Acts 17:12) 
Many of them therefore believed, as did quite a few of the distinguished Greek women and many men.

(Acts 17:13) 
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Beroea also, they came there too, stirring up and disturbing the crowds.

(Acts 17:14) 
Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.

(Acts 17:15) 
Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens. After receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.

(Acts 17:16) 
Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.

(Acts 17:17) 
So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.

(Acts 17:18) 
Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities," because he was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection.

(Acts 17:19) 
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?

(Acts 17:20) 
For you bring some strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."

(Acts 17:21) 
Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.

(Acts 17:22) 
So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.

(Acts 17:23) 
For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.

(Acts 17:24) 
The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of the universe and the earth, does not live in temples made by hands,

(Acts 17:25) 
nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.

(Acts 17:26) 
And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,

(Acts 17:27) 
that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,

(Acts 17:28) 
for "'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are indeed his offspring.'

(Acts 17:29) 
Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.

(Acts 17:30) 
The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,

(Acts 17:31) 
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."

(Acts 17:32) 
Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, "We will hear you again about this."

(Acts 17:33) 
So Paul went out from their midst.

(Acts 17:34) 
But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.

(Acts 18:1) 
After these things, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

(Acts 18:2) 
And when he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome), he went to them.

(Acts 18:3) 
And because he practiced the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for they were tentmakers.

(Acts 18:4) 
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, explaining the name of Jesus, and persuading Jews and Greeks.

(Acts 18:5) 
But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

(Acts 18:6) 
But when they opposed and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them: “Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”

(Acts 18:7) 
And he departed from there and went to the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.

(Acts 18:8) 
And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.

(Acts 18:9) 
And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision: “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent;

(Acts 18:10) 
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”

(Acts 18:11) 
And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

(Acts 18:12) 
But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,

(Acts 18:13) 
saying: “This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”

(Acts 18:14) 
And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If there were any act of wrongdoing or a wicked crime, O Jews, I would have reason to hear you.

(Acts 18:15) 
But if there are questions of words and names and your law, you yourselves look to it. I will not be a judge of these things.”

(Acts 18:16) 
And he drove them from the judgment seat.

(Acts 18:17) 
Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.

(Acts 18:18) 
Then Paul, after staying many more days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having cut his hair in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.

(Acts 18:19) 
And he came to Ephesus, and he left them there. But he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

(Acts 18:20) 
When they asked him to stay longer, he did not consent,

(Acts 18:21) 
but took leave of them, saying: “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem. But I will return again to you, God willing.” And he set out from Ephesus.

(Acts 18:22) 
And when he had come down to Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then he went down to Antioch.

(Acts 18:23) 
And having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

(Acts 18:24) 
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, mighty in the Scriptures.

(Acts 18:25) 
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.

(Acts 18:26) 
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

(Acts 18:27) 
And when he wanted to pass over to Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed,

(Acts 18:28) 
for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

(Acts 19:1) 
After Apollos had moved on to Corinth, Paul traveled through the upper regions and came to Ephesus. There, he found some disciples,

(Acts 19:2) 
and he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “We haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 19:3) 
He asked them, “Then how were you baptized?” They answered, “With John's baptism.”

(Acts 19:4) 
Paul then said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.”

(Acts 19:5) 
After hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 19:6) 
And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.

(Acts 19:7) 
There were about twelve men in all.

(Acts 19:8) 
He entered the synagogue, and for three months he spoke boldly, debating and persuading people about the kingdom of God.

(Acts 19:9) 
But when some of them hardened themselves and refused to believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them, and separated the disciples, arguing daily in the school of Tyrannus.

(Acts 19:10) 
This continued for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

(Acts 19:11) 
And God worked extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,

(Acts 19:12) 
so that when they placed handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body on the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.

(Acts 19:13) 
Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”

(Acts 19:14) 
There were seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva who were doing this.

(Acts 19:15) 
But the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?”

(Acts 19:16) 
And the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them all, and they ran out of the house naked and wounded.

(Acts 19:17) 
This became known to everyone in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

(Acts 19:18) 
Many of those who had believed came, confessing and divulging their practices.

(Acts 19:19) 
And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in front of everyone. When they calculated the value of the books, they found that it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.

(Acts 19:20) 
So the word of the Lord continued to grow and prevail.

(Acts 19:21) 
Now after these events, Paul decided in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”

(Acts 19:22) 
So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia for a while.

(Acts 19:23) 
About that time, there arose a considerable disturbance concerning the Way.

(Acts 19:24) 
For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the artisans.

(Acts 19:25) 
He gathered them together with the workmen of similar trades and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this business.

(Acts 19:26) 
You also see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost the whole of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.

(Acts 19:27) 
And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will be dethroned from her magnificence.”

(Acts 19:28) 
When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

(Acts 19:29) 
The city was filled with confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's Macedonian travel companions.

(Acts 19:30) 
But when Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.

(Acts 19:31) 
Some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, also sent a message to him urging him not to venture into the theater.

(Acts 19:32) 
Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.

(Acts 19:33) 
Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.

(Acts 19:34) 
But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

(Acts 19:35) 
And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven?

(Acts 19:36) 
Since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.

(Acts 19:37) 
For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.

(Acts 19:38) 
If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.

(Acts 19:39) 
But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.

(Acts 19:40) 
For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause for which we can give an account of this commotion.”

(Acts 19:41) 
And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

(Acts 20:1) 
After the riot had ended, Paul called together his disciples, and encouraged them. Then he departed, heading towards Macedonia.

(Acts 20:2) 
Having traveled throughout those areas, he encouraged them with many words. Then he came to Greece.

(Acts 20:3) 
He spent three months there. When the Jews plotted against him, intending to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.

(Acts 20:4) 
Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy accompanied him. Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia were also with him.

(Acts 20:5) 
These men went ahead and waited for us in Troas.

(Acts 20:6) 
After the Feast of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi. Five days later, we met them in Troas.

(Acts 20:7) 
On the first day of the week, when the disciples gathered to break bread, Paul spoke with them, since he was going to leave the next day. He kept speaking until midnight.

(Acts 20:8) 
There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.

(Acts 20:9) 
A young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window. He was overcome by deep sleep while Paul was speaking at length, and falling from the third story, he was taken up dead.

(Acts 20:10) 
Paul went down and threw himself on him. Embracing him, he said, “Do not be alarmed, for his soul is in him.”

(Acts 20:11) 
Then he went upstairs, broke bread, and ate. He talked for a long time until dawn. Then he departed.

(Acts 20:12) 
They took the young man back alive, and they were greatly comforted.

(Acts 20:13) 
Meanwhile, we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard, as he had planned. He himself would travel by land.

(Acts 20:14) 
When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene.

(Acts 20:15) 
We sailed from there and the next day arrived opposite Chios. The following day we put in at Samos, and the next day we arrived at Miletus.

(Acts 20:16) 
Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, for the day of Pentecost.

(Acts 20:17) 
From Miletus, he sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus.

(Acts 20:18) 
When they came to him, he said, “You know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day I came to Asia,

(Acts 20:19) 
“serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and trials, which befell me through the plots of the Jews.

(Acts 20:20) 
“How I did not shrink from declaring anything that was helpful for you, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,

(Acts 20:21) 
“testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.

(Acts 20:22) 
“And now, bound by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,

(Acts 20:23) 
“except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.

(Acts 20:24) 
“But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.

(Acts 20:25) 
“And now, I know that you will no longer see my face, all of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom.

(Acts 20:26) 
“Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you.

(Acts 20:27) 
“For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.

(Acts 20:28) 
“Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.

(Acts 20:29) 
“I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.

(Acts 20:30) 
“And from among your own selves, men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.

(Acts 20:31) 
“Therefore, be watchful, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears.

(Acts 20:32) 
“And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, who is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

(Acts 20:33) 
“I coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.

(Acts 20:34) 
“You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.

(Acts 20:35) 
“In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”

(Acts 20:36) 
When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.

(Acts 20:37) 
And they all wept a great deal, and falling on Paul’s neck, they kissed him,

(Acts 20:38) 
being especially grieved by the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.

(Acts 21:1) 
After we escaped, we set sail. We sailed straight to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

(Acts 21:2) 
We found a ship sailing to Phoenicia, and we boarded and set sail.

(Acts 21:3) 
We sighted Cyprus, leaving it to the left, and sailed to Syria. We landed at Tyre because the ship was going to unload its cargo there.

(Acts 21:4) 
Finding the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Holy Spirit, they warned Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:5) 
When our time there was up, we set out and continued on our way. They all, with their wives and children, escorted us out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.

(Acts 21:6) 
After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.

(Acts 21:7) 
We continued our voyage and sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.

(Acts 21:8) 
The next day we set out and came to Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.

(Acts 21:9) 
He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.

(Acts 21:10) 
As we were staying there for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

(Acts 21:11) 
He came to us and took Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands, he said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit: ‘The man whose belt this is, the Jews will bind in Jerusalem and deliver into the hands of the Gentiles.’”

(Acts 21:12) 
When we heard this, we and the others there begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:13) 
Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

(Acts 21:14) 
When he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, “The will of the Lord be done.”

(Acts 21:15) 
After these days, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:16) 
Some of the disciples from Caesarea came with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, where we were to stay.

(Acts 21:17) 
When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.

(Acts 21:18) 
The next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.

(Acts 21:19) 
After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.

(Acts 21:20) 
When they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law.

(Acts 21:21) 
And they have been told about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to the customs.

(Acts 21:22) 
What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.

(Acts 21:23) 
Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.

(Acts 21:24) 
Take these men and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.

(Acts 21:25) 
But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our decision that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.”

(Acts 21:26) 
Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, announcing the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.

(Acts 21:27) 
When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,

(Acts 21:28) 
crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”

(Acts 21:29) 
For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.

(Acts 21:30) 
The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.

(Acts 21:31) 
As they were seeking to kill him, the report came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.

(Acts 21:32) 
He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

(Acts 21:33) 
Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.

(Acts 21:34) 
Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.

(Acts 21:35) 
When he came to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,

(Acts 21:36) 
for the mob of the people followed, crying out, “Away with him!”

(Acts 21:37) 
As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?”

(Acts 21:38) 
And he replied, “Do you know Greek?

(Acts 21:39) 
Are you not the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up a revolt and led out into the desert the four thousand men of the Assassins?”

(Acts 21:40) 
Paul said, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.”

(Acts 22:1) 
Men, brothers, and fathers, hear now my defense!

(Acts 22:2) 
They were even more ready to listen when they heard Paul speaking Hebrew.

(Acts 22:3) 
Then Paul said: “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I studied at the feet of Gamaliel, and I was taught in accordance with the law of our fathers. I was full of zeal for God, as all of you are today.

(Acts 22:4) 
I persecuted the followers of this new way, even to the point of death. I imprisoned men and women.

(Acts 22:5) 
The high priest and the entire council can testify to this. After receiving letters to the brothers, I was on my way to Damascus to bring back the prisoners who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.

(Acts 22:6) 
As I was on my way and approaching Damascus, around noon a bright light suddenly flashed around me from the universe:

(Acts 22:7) 
I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’

(Acts 22:8) 
I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’

(Acts 22:9) 
Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.

(Acts 22:10) 
I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord replied, ‘Go to Damascus, and there you will be told all that you are appointed to do.’

(Acts 22:11) 
Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and I went to Damascus.

(Acts 22:12) 
A man named Ananias, a devout observer of the Law, who was well respected by all the Jews living there,

(Acts 22:13) 
came and stood by me, and said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight.’ And at that very moment I looked up at him.

(Acts 22:14) 
He said, ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to know His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of His voice.

(Acts 22:15) 
For you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.

(Acts 22:16) 
And now, why delay? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.’

(Acts 22:17) 
It happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance.

(Acts 22:18) 
I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’

(Acts 22:19) 
I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You in every synagogue.

(Acts 22:20) 
And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I was there, agreeing with his execution, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’

(Acts 22:21) 
Then He said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the nations.’

(Acts 22:22) 
They listened to him until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, ‘Get rid of this man from the earth, for he is not worthy to live!’

(Acts 22:23) 
As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,

(Acts 22:24) 
the tribune ordered Paul to be brought into the fortress and commanded that he be examined by scourging, to learn the reason why they were shouting against him.

(Acts 22:25) 
When they stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion standing by, ‘Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen?’

(Acts 22:26) 
When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and told him, saying, ‘What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.’

(Acts 22:27) 
The tribune approached Paul and asked, ‘Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?’ And Paul replied, ‘I am.’

(Acts 22:28) 
The tribune answered, ‘I paid a large sum for this citizenship.’ Paul said, ‘But I was born a citizen.’

(Acts 22:29) 
Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew. The tribune was also afraid because he had bound Paul, since he knew that he was a Roman citizen.

(Acts 22:30) 
Wishing to know the real reason why the Jews were accusing him, the next day the tribune released Paul and ordered the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and placed him before them.

(Acts 23:1) 
Then Paul, looking at the council, said: "Brothers, I have lived before God with a clear conscience, even to this day."

(Acts 23:2) 
But the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by to strike him on the mouth.

(Acts 23:3) 
Then Paul said to him: "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit there judging me according to the law, and then order me to be struck in violation of the law?"

(Acts 23:4) 
Those who stood by said: "Do you revile God's high priest?"

(Acts 23:5) 
And Paul said: "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.’"

(Acts 23:6) 
But Paul, knowing that one part of them were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I am being judged for the hope and the resurrection of the dead."

(Acts 23:7) 
And when he had said this, there arose a division between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.

(Acts 23:8) 
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.

(Acts 23:9) 
Then a great cry arose, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party rose up, contending and saying: "We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"

(Acts 23:10) 
And when a great dissension arose, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him from among them and bring him into the fortress.

(Acts 23:11) 
And the following night, the Lord stood by him and said: "Be of good cheer; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome."

(Acts 23:12) 
And when day came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

(Acts 23:13) 
There were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy.

(Acts 23:14) 
They went to the chief priests and the elders and said: "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."

(Acts 23:15) 
So now you, with the council, give notice to the tribune so that he may bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to examine his case more fully. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near."

(Acts 23:16) 
But when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the fortress and told Paul.

(Acts 23:17) 
Then Paul called one of the centurions and said: "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."

(Acts 23:18) 
The centurion took him, and brought him to the tribune, and said: "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you."

(Acts 23:19) 
The tribune took the young man by the hand and, taking him aside, asked him privately: "What is it that you have to tell me?"

(Acts 23:20) 
And he said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more fully about him.

(Acts 23:21) 
So do not listen to them, for more than forty men from among them are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And they are now ready, waiting for your promise."

(Acts 23:22) 
Then the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of these things." 

(Acts 23:23) 
He then called two centurions and said: "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night."

(Acts 23:24) 
Also, provide mounts so that they may set Paul on them and bring him safely to Felix the governor."

(Acts 23:25) 
And he wrote a letter, which read as follows:

(Acts 23:26) 
"Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.

(Acts 23:27) 
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. When I learned that he was a Roman citizen, I came upon them with the soldiers.

(Acts 23:28) 
Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.

(Acts 23:29) 
I found him to be accused over questions about their law, but as having no charge worthy of death or imprisonment.

(Acts 23:30) 
And when it was revealed to me that the Jews were planning an ambush for the man, I sent him to you without delay, and I also commanded his accusers to state their case before you. Farewell."

(Acts 23:31) 
So the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

(Acts 23:32) 
On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and they returned to the fortress.

(Acts 23:33) 
When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.

(Acts 23:34) 
And when he had read it, he asked him what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,

(Acts 23:35) 
"I will hear your case," he said, "when your accusers arrive." And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.

(Acts 24:1) 
Five days later, Ananias the high priest went to Caesarea, along with some of the elders, and with the orator Tertullus. They made accusations against Paul to the governor.

(Acts 24:2) 
After Paul was summoned, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: "Since we are experiencing much peace through your wise governance, and many reforms are being made for our people by your foresight,"

(Acts 24:3) 
“we always and in all places acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.

(Acts 24:4) 
But, so as not to detain you, I ask that you hear us briefly, with your usual kindness.

(Acts 24:5) 
“For we have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

(Acts 24:6) 
“He even tried to profane the Temple. We arrested him.

(Acts 24:7) 
“But Lysias the tribune came and rescued him from our hands by using great force.

(Acts 24:8) 
“He ordered his accusers to come to you. From him, you can learn about all these things.

(Acts 24:9) 
“The Jews also joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were so.”

(Acts 24:10) 
Then Paul, by a nod from the governor, began his defense: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I confidently make my defense.

(Acts 24:11) 
“For you can ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

(Acts 24:12) 
“And they did not find me disputing with anyone in the Temple, or causing a riot among the people, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.

(Acts 24:13) 
“And they cannot prove the things they now accuse me of.

(Acts 24:14) 
“But I confess this to you: that I worship the God of my ancestors in the way they call a heresy, believing everything laid down in the Law and the Prophets.

(Acts 24:15) 
“I have hope in God, which they themselves also await, that there will be a resurrection of the just and the unjust.

(Acts 24:16) 
“And so, I always strive to keep my conscience clear before God and men.

(Acts 24:17) 
“Now, after many years, I came to bring alms and offerings for my nation.

(Acts 24:18) 
“While I was in these activities, some Jews from Asia found me in the Temple. I was purified and not with a crowd or in an uproar.

(Acts 24:19) 
“They should have been here before you to make accusations, if they had any against me.

(Acts 24:20) 
“Or let these men here themselves state what wrong they found when I stood before the council,

(Acts 24:21) 
“unless it was for this one statement I cried out while standing among them: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged before you today.'

(Acts 24:22) 
Felix, having heard these things, postponed the hearing, saying: “When I have examined the case more carefully, I will decide it.

(Acts 24:23) 
He ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody, but to allow him some freedom and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to or visiting him.

(Acts 24:24) 
After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

(Acts 24:25) 
And as Paul discussed righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said: "Go away for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will send for you."

(Acts 24:26) 
At the same time, he hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, so he often sent for him and talked with him.

(Acts 24:27) 
When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.

(Acts 25:1) 
After Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea after three days.

(Acts 25:2) 
The high priests and the Jewish leaders went to him and informed Festus about Paul, begging him,

(Acts 25:3) 
asking a favor against him, that he send him to Jerusalem. They were plotting to kill him along the way.

(Acts 25:4) 
Festus replied that Paul was being kept under guard in Caesarea and that he himself would be returning quickly.

(Acts 25:5) 
“Therefore,” he said, “let the men among you who are powerful go down with me and accuse him if there is anything wrong with the man.”

(Acts 25:6) 
After spending eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought in.

(Acts 25:7) 
When he appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges which they couldn't prove,

(Acts 25:8) 
while Paul defended himself, saying that he had committed no offense against the Jewish Law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar.

(Acts 25:9) 
Festus, wishing to do a favor for the Jews, answered Paul: “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me in these matters?”

(Acts 25:10) 
Paul said: “I am standing at Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you yourself well know.”

(Acts 25:11) 
“If I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die. But if there is nothing in what these men accuse me of, no one can give me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”

(Acts 25:12) 
Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”

(Acts 25:13) 
After some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea and greeted Festus.

(Acts 25:14) 
After they had spent many days there, Festus explained Paul’s case to the king, saying: “There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,

(Acts 25:15) 
about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the high priests and the elders of the Jews asked for a judgment, demanding condemnation.

(Acts 25:16) 
I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused has his accusers present, and he is allowed to defend himself against the charges.

(Acts 25:17) 
So when they came here, without delay, I sat on the tribunal the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.

(Acts 25:18) 
When the accusers stood around, they brought no charge of any wrongdoing that I suspected of him.

(Acts 25:19) 
But they had some questions about their own superstition against him, and about a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul said was alive.

(Acts 25:20) 
Because I was uncertain about this question, I asked if he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these matters.

(Acts 25:21) 
But when Paul appealed to be kept for the judgment of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”

(Acts 25:22) 
Then Agrippa said to Festus: “I would also like to hear the man.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”

(Acts 25:23) 
The next day, when Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great pomp, and entered the audience hall with the tribunes and the leading men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.

(Acts 25:24) 
Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all of you here with us, you see this man, about whom the whole multitude of Jews has petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he shouldn’t live any longer.

(Acts 25:25) 
But to me it seemed that he had done nothing deserving of death. But because he appealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him.”

(Acts 25:26) 
“I don’t have anything certain to write to the Lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation, I may have something to write.

(Acts 25:27) 
“For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to show the charges against him.”

(Acts 26:1) 
Paul, writing with his own hand, said: “King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed that I have to defend myself today before you concerning all of the things of which you accuse me,

(Acts 26:2) 
especially because you are well acquainted with all the customs and the controversies among the Jews. I therefore beg you to listen to me patiently.

(Acts 26:3) 
For my life from my youth, which was from the beginning among my nation and in Jerusalem, is well known to all the Jews,

(Acts 26:4) 
who know me from the beginning, if they wish to bear witness, because I lived according to the strictest sect of our religion, as a Pharisee.

(Acts 26:5) 
And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise which was made by God to our fathers,

(Acts 26:6) 
the hope of which the twelve tribes, continuously serving, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.

(Acts 26:7) 
Why do you consider it unbelievable that God raises the dead?

(Acts 26:8) 
I truly thought that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth:

(Acts 26:9) 
and I did this in Jerusalem. I imprisoned many of the saints, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were being put to death, I cast my vote against them.

(Acts 26:10) 
And punishing them often in every synagogue, I forced them to blaspheme. And I was extremely enraged at them, even persecuting them to distant cities.

(Acts 26:11) 
In which I was traveling to Damascus, with the authority and permission of the chief priests,

(Acts 26:12) 
at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who were with me.

(Acts 26:13) 
But when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.”

(Acts 26:14) 
And I said, “Who are you, Lord?” And the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

(Acts 26:15) 
But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, that I may appoint you as a minister and a witness of those things which you have seen and of those things in which I will appear to you,

(Acts 26:16) 
delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,

(Acts 26:17) 
to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.”

(Acts 26:18) 
Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,

(Acts 26:19) 
but proclaimed to those of Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing works worthy of repentance.

(Acts 26:20) 
For this reason the Jews, when I was in the temple, tried to kill me.

(Acts 26:21) 
Having therefore obtained help from God, I stand to this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing except those things which the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:

(Acts 26:22) 
that Christ should suffer, that He should be the first to rise from the dead, and that He would proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.”

(Acts 26:23) 
As he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Much learning is driving you to madness.”

(Acts 26:24) 
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the words of truth and soberness.

(Acts 26:25) 
For the king knows about these things, to whom I also speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.

(Acts 26:26) 
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”

(Acts 26:27) 
Then Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time you persuade me to become a Christian.”

(Acts 26:28) 
And Paul said, “I would to God that not only you, but also all those who hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”

(Acts 26:29) 
When he had said these things, the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with them rose up;

(Acts 26:30) 
and when they had withdrawn, they talked with one another, saying, “This man is doing nothing worthy of death or chains.”

(Acts 26:31) 
Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”

(Acts 27:1) 
When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who was from the Augustan cohort.

(Acts 27:2) 
We boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to ports along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus of Thessalonica, a Macedonian, was with us.

(Acts 27:3) 
The next day, we put in at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive their care.

(Acts 27:4) 
We set sail from there and sailed along the coast of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.

(Acts 27:5) 
We sailed through the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, and arrived at Myra in Lycia.

(Acts 27:6) 
There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.

(Acts 27:7) 
After sailing slowly for many days, we arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind was against us, we sailed along the coast of Crete, near Salmone.

(Acts 27:8) 
We struggled to sail along it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.

(Acts 27:9) 
Since much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was already over, Paul warned them,

(Acts 27:10) 
“Men, I see that this voyage will be disastrous and cause great damage, not only to the ship and the cargo, but also to our lives.”

(Acts 27:11) 
But the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the ship’s captain than by what Paul said.

(Acts 27:12) 
Because the harbor wasn’t suitable for wintering, most of them decided to sail on from there, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor in Crete facing southwest and northwest, to winter there.

(Acts 27:13) 
When a gentle south wind began to blow, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete.

(Acts 27:14) 
But soon a hurricane-force wind, called the northeaster, struck the ship.

(Acts 27:15) 
The ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave way to it and were driven along.

(Acts 27:16) 
Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get the ship’s boat under control. After hoisting it aboard, they used ropes to rig the ship, and fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sails and let the ship be driven along.

(Acts 27:17) 
The next day, as we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to jettison cargo. On the third day, they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands.

(Acts 27:18) 
When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and the storm continued raging, all hope of our being saved was at last gone.

(Acts 27:19) 
Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have taken my advice not to set sail from Crete and have avoided this damage and loss.

(Acts 27:20) 
“But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be lost.

(Acts 27:21) 
“For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me

(Acts 27:22) 
and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar. And God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’

(Acts 27:23) 
So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.

(Acts 27:24) 
“We must run aground on some island.”

(Acts 27:25) 
About midnight the sailors sensed that they were approaching land. They took soundings and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms. Fearing that we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.

(Acts 27:26) 
In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to let go anchors from the bow.

(Acts 27:27) 
Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”

(Acts 27:28) 
Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.

(Acts 27:29) 
When daylight began to appear, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “For the past fourteen days you have been in constant suspense, without food, eating nothing.

(Acts 27:30) 
“Therefore I urge you to take some food. You need it for your survival, for not a hair of your head will be lost.”

(Acts 27:31) 
After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.

(Acts 27:32) 
They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.

(Acts 27:33) 
Altogether there were 276 of us on board.

(Acts 27:34) 
When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.

(Acts 27:35) 
When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they planned to run the ship ashore if they could.

(Acts 27:36) 
Cutting loose the anchors, they put out to sea, and at the same time loosened the ropes that held the rudders. They hoisted the foresail to the wind and sailed toward the beach.

(Acts 27:37) 
But striking a reef, the ship ran aground, and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken to pieces by the surf.

(Acts 27:38) 
The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.

(Acts 27:39) 
But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,

(Acts 27:40) 
and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.

(Acts 28:1) 
After we survived the shipwreck, we learned that the island was called Melita.

(Acts 28:2) 
The local people treated us with uncommon kindness.

(Acts 28:3) 
They lit a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain and the cold.

(Acts 28:4) 
Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire. A viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.

(Acts 28:5) 
When the local people saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer! Though he escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”

(Acts 28:6) 
Paul, however, shook the snake into the fire and suffered no harm.

(Acts 28:7) 
They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing happened to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

(Acts 28:8) 
Near that place were the lands of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and showed us generous hospitality for three days.

(Acts 28:9) 
It happened that Publius' father was sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after praying and laying his hands on him, he healed him.

(Acts 28:10) 
After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.

(Acts 28:11) 
They honored us with many honors, and when we set sail, they put on board whatever we needed.

(Acts 28:12) 
After three months, we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island. It had the figurehead of the twin gods, Castor and Pollux.

(Acts 28:13) 
We put in at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.

(Acts 28:14) 
From there we sailed along and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and we reached Puteoli.

(Acts 28:15) 
There we found some brothers and sisters and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.

(Acts 28:16) 
The brothers and sisters there heard that we were coming and came as far as the Market of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

(Acts 28:17) 
When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.

(Acts 28:18) 
After three days, Paul called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, “Brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.

(Acts 28:19) 
The Romans, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.

(Acts 28:20) 
But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.

(Acts 28:21) 
For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you. For it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”

(Acts 28:22) 
They replied, “We have neither received any letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any of the brothers come here to report or speak any evil about you.

(Acts 28:23) 
But we want to hear from you what you think, for we know that this sect is spoken against everywhere.”

(Acts 28:24) 
So they arranged a day with him, and they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. He was explaining things to them, and he was testifying about the kingdom of God. From morning until evening, he was trying to convince them about Jesus, using the Law of Moses and the Prophets.

(Acts 28:25) 
Some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.

(Acts 28:26) 
They disagreed among themselves and began to leave, after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah, saying,

(Acts 28:27) 
‘Go to this people and say: “You will keep on hearing, but will never understand; you will keep on seeing, but will never perceive.

(Acts 28:28) 
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, so that they might not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.’

(Acts 28:29) 
Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

(Acts 28:30) 
Paul spent two whole years in his own rented house, and he welcomed all who visited him,

(Acts 28:31) 
proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.

(Romans 1:1) 
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God,

(Romans 1:2) 
which God had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,

(Romans 1:3) 
concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,

(Romans 1:4) 
who was appointed the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord,

(Romans 1:5) 
through whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name's sake,

(Romans 1:6) 
among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ:

(Romans 1:7) 
To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 1:8) 
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.

(Romans 1:9) 
For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,

(Romans 1:10) 
always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.

(Romans 1:11) 
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;

(Romans 1:12) 
that is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.

(Romans 1:13) 
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

(Romans 1:14) 
To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.

(Romans 1:15) 
So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.

(Romans 1:16) 
For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.

(Romans 1:17) 
For in it the justice of God is revealed, from faith unto faith: as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.

(Romans 1:18) 
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice.

(Romans 1:19) 
Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.

(Romans 1:20) 
For the invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.

(Romans 1:21) 
Because that, when they had known God, they have not glorified Him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened.

(Romans 1:22) 
For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

(Romans 1:23) 
And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts, and of serpents.

(Romans 1:24) 
Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.

(Romans 1:25) 
Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed for ever. Amen.

(Romans 1:26) 
For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.

(Romans 1:27) 
And the men in like manner, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.

(Romans 1:28) 
And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient;

(Romans 1:29) 
Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

(Romans 1:30) 
Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

(Romans 1:31) 
Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.

(Romans 1:32) 
Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.

(Romans 2:1) 
You, therefore, are without excuse, every man who judges others. In that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you practice the same sins that you judge.

(Romans 2:2) 
We know that God’s judgment is according to truth against those who commit such sins.

(Romans 2:3) 
Do you think that you, a man who judges those who do such things, yet practices them yourself, will escape the judgment of God?

(Romans 2:4) 
Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Do you not know that God’s goodness is meant to lead you to repentance?

(Romans 2:5) 
But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.

(Romans 2:6) 
He will render to each one according to his deeds.

(Romans 2:7) 
To those who by patiently doing good works seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.

(Romans 2:8) 
But to those who are contentious and who do not obey the truth, but believe in wickedness, there will be wrath and indignation.

(Romans 2:9) 
Tribulation and anguish will come upon every soul of man who does evil, first to the Jew and also to the Greek.

(Romans 2:10) 
But glory and honor and peace will be given to everyone who does good, first to the Jew and also to the Greek.

(Romans 2:11) 
For there is no respect of persons with God.

(Romans 2:12) 
For as many as have sinned without the Law will perish without the Law, and as many as have sinned in the Law will be judged by the Law.

(Romans 2:13) 
For it is not the hearers of the Law who are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the Law who will be justified.

(Romans 2:14) 
For when the Gentiles, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things that are in the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves.

(Romans 2:15) 
They show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or even excusing one another.

(Romans 2:16) 
This will take place on the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Gospel, through Jesus Christ.

(Romans 2:17) 
Indeed, if you are called a Jew, and you rest in the Law, and you glory in God,

(Romans 2:18) 
and you know His will, and you approve the things that are more important, being instructed by the Law,

(Romans 2:19) 
you trust that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,

(Romans 2:20) 
a teacher of the foolish, a master of the young, possessing the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law.

(Romans 2:21) 
You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one should not steal, do you steal?

(Romans 2:22) 
You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?

(Romans 2:23) 
You who glory in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?

(Romans 2:24) 
As it is written: “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”

(Romans 2:25) 
Circumcision indeed profits if you do the Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

(Romans 2:26) 
If therefore the uncircumcised keep the just requirements of the Law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?

(Romans 2:27) 
And that which is by nature uncircumcised, fulfilling the Law, will judge you who are a transgressor of the Law, though you have the letter and circumcision.

(Romans 2:28) 
For it is not the one who is a Jew outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outwardly in the flesh,

(Romans 2:29) 
but the one who is a Jew inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not from men but from God.

(Romans 3:1) 
So then, what advantage does a Jew have? What is the value of circumcision?

(Romans 3:2) 
Much in every way! First, because the very words of God were entrusted to them.

(Romans 3:3) 
What if some of them were unfaithful? Does their unfaithfulness make God’s faithfulness of no effect?

(Romans 3:4) 
Certainly not! Rather, God is true, but every man is a liar, as it is written: “That you may be justified in your words, and may overcome when you are judged.”

(Romans 3:5) 
But if our wickedness commends the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who inflicts wrath?

(Romans 3:6) 
I speak in a human way. Certainly not! Otherwise, how would God judge the world?

(Romans 3:7) 
For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?

(Romans 3:8) 
And why not say, as we are blasphemously accused, and as some affirm that we say, “Let us do evil, that good may come”? Their condemnation is just.

(Romans 3:9) 
What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have previously charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,

(Romans 3:10) 
as it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.”

(Romans 3:11) 
“All have turned aside; together they have become useless; there is no one who does good, there is not even one.”

(Romans 3:12) 
“Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.”

(Romans 3:13) 
“Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood,”

(Romans 3:14) 
“Ruin and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace they have not known.”

(Romans 3:15) 
“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

(Romans 3:16) 
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and all the world may become subject to God.

(Romans 3:17) 
Therefore by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, because through the law comes the knowledge of sin.

(Romans 3:18) 
But now the justice of God has been revealed apart from the law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets,

(Romans 3:19) 
the justice of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and upon all who believe. For there is no distinction,

(Romans 3:20) 
for all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God,

(Romans 3:21) 
and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,

(Romans 3:22) 
whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His justice, because in His divine forbearance He had passed over former sins,

(Romans 3:23) 
to demonstrate His justice at the present time, so that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

(Romans 3:24) 
Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.

(Romans 3:25) 
For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

(Romans 3:26) 
Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.

(Romans 3:27) 
Do we then nullify the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

(Romans 4:1) 
What then are we to say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered?

(Romans 4:2) 
If Abraham was justified by works, he would have something to boast about, but not before God.

(Romans 4:3) 
What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

(Romans 4:4) 
Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a favor, but as something owed.

(Romans 4:5) 
But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.

(Romans 4:6) 
David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:

(Romans 4:7) 
“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

(Romans 4:8) 
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.”

(Romans 4:9) 
Is this blessedness then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.

(Romans 4:10) 
How then was it credited? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before he was circumcised? It was not after he had been circumcised, but before.

(Romans 4:11) 
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, so that righteousness might be credited to them also.

(Romans 4:12) 
And he is the father of the circumcised, who are not merely circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while still uncircumcised.

(Romans 4:13) 
For the promise to Abraham and his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.

(Romans 4:14) 
For if those who are of the Law are heirs, then faith is made void, and the promise is nullified.

(Romans 4:15) 
For the Law brings about wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.

(Romans 4:16) 
For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,

(Romans 4:17) 
(as it is written, “A father of many nations I have made you”) in the sight of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.

(Romans 4:18) 
In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So shall your descendants be.”

(Romans 4:19) 
Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;

(Romans 4:20) 
yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,

(Romans 4:21) 
and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.

(Romans 4:22) 
Therefore it was also credited to him as righteousness.

(Romans 4:23) 
Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,

(Romans 4:24) 
but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,

(Romans 4:25) 
He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.

(Romans 5:1) 
Having been made righteous by faith, we now have peace with God through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 5:2) 
Through Him, we also have access by faith to this grace where we stand. And we also rejoice in the hope of the glory of the children of God.

(Romans 5:3) 
But not only this, we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,

(Romans 5:4) 
and endurance produces proven character, and character, hope.

(Romans 5:5) 
And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

(Romans 5:6) 
For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

(Romans 5:7) 
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone might dare to die.

(Romans 5:8) 
But God proves His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

(Romans 5:9) 
Since therefore we have now been made righteous by His blood, we will be saved through Him from God's judgment.

(Romans 5:10) 
For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more now that we are reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.

(Romans 5:11) 
Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through Our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

(Romans 5:12) 
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.

(Romans 5:13) 
For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law.

(Romans 5:14) 
Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of the One who was to come.

(Romans 5:15) 
But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one man many died, how much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many!

(Romans 5:16) 
And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.

(Romans 5:17) 
For if by the one man's trespass death reigned through that one, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one Jesus Christ.

(Romans 5:18) 
Therefore, as through one man's trespass there came condemnation for all men, so also through one righteous act there came justification for all men, resulting in life.

(Romans 5:19) 
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one man's obedience many will be made righteous.

(Romans 5:20) 
Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,

(Romans 5:21) 
so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 6:1) 
So what should we say? Should we continue to sin, so that grace will increase?

(Romans 6:2) 
Absolutely not! If we are dead to sin, how can we continue to live in it?

(Romans 6:3) 
Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized in Christ Jesus were baptized in His death?

(Romans 6:4) 
Through baptism we were buried with Him in death, so that as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might live a new life.

(Romans 6:5) 
For if we have been united with Him in His death, we will certainly also be in His resurrection.

(Romans 6:6) 
We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.

(Romans 6:7) 
Because someone who is dead has been freed from sin.

(Romans 6:8) 
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.

(Romans 6:9) 
For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.

(Romans 6:10) 
The death that He died, He died to sin, once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives for God.

(Romans 6:11) 
So you also should consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 6:12) 
Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its passions.

(Romans 6:13) 
Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer your members to God as instruments of righteousness.

(Romans 6:14) 
For sin will no longer rule over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.

(Romans 6:15) 
So what? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!

(Romans 6:16) 
Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey—either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?

(Romans 6:17) 
But thanks be to God, that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching to which you were committed.

(Romans 6:18) 
Having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.

(Romans 6:19) 
I am using an example from ordinary human life because of your weakness. For just as you presented your members as slaves of impurity and of lawlessness, leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness, leading to sanctification.

(Romans 6:20) 
When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.

(Romans 6:21) 
But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

(Romans 6:22) 
But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God, you have your fruit, leading to sanctification; the end is eternal life.

(Romans 6:23) 
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 7:1) 
Do you not know, brothers—I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law governs a man for as long as he lives?

(Romans 7:2) 
For a woman who is married is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.

(Romans 7:3) 
Accordingly, if she associates with another man while her husband is still alive, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is released from that law, so that she is not an adulteress when she marries another man.

(Romans 7:4) 
Therefore, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, that you may belong to another, to him who has risen from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.

(Romans 7:5) 
For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.

(Romans 7:6) 
But now we are released from the law, because we died to that which held us captive, so that we may serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.

(Romans 7:7) 
What then shall we say? Is the law sin? By no means! Yet, I did not come to know sin except through the law. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”

(Romans 7:8) 
But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin was dead.

(Romans 7:9) 
I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive,

(Romans 7:10) 
and I died. And the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.

(Romans 7:11) 
For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.

(Romans 7:12) 
So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.

(Romans 7:13) 
Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.

(Romans 7:14) 
For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.

(Romans 7:15) 
For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.

(Romans 7:16) 
Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.

(Romans 7:17) 
So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

(Romans 7:18) 
For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.

(Romans 7:19) 
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.

(Romans 7:20) 
Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

(Romans 7:21) 
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.

(Romans 7:22) 
For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,

(Romans 7:23) 
but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.

(Romans 7:24) 
Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?

(Romans 7:25) 
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

(Romans 8:1) 
There is, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not live according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

(Romans 8:2) 
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.

(Romans 8:3) 
For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,

(Romans 8:4) 
that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

(Romans 8:5) 
For those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.

(Romans 8:6) 
For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.

(Romans 8:7) 
Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.

(Romans 8:8) 
And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

(Romans 8:9) 
But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.

(Romans 8:10) 
And if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

(Romans 8:11) 
And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who dwells in you.

(Romans 8:12) 
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.

(Romans 8:13) 
For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the flesh, you will live.

(Romans 8:14) 
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

(Romans 8:15) 
For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry out: Abba (Father).

(Romans 8:16) 
For the Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.

(Romans 8:17) 
And if children, then heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so if we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him.

(Romans 8:18) 
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.

(Romans 8:19) 
For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.

(Romans 8:20) 
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope:

(Romans 8:21) 
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.

(Romans 8:22) 
For we know that every creature groans and is in pain until now.

(Romans 8:23) 
And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.

(Romans 8:24) 
For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he hope for?

(Romans 8:25) 
But if we hope for that which we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

(Romans 8:26) 
Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmity. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself asks for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

(Romans 8:27) 
And He Who searches the hearts knows what the Spirit desires; because He asks for the saints according to God.

(Romans 8:28) 
And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.

(Romans 8:29) 
For those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

(Romans 8:30) 
And whom he predestined, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

(Romans 8:31) 
What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?

(Romans 8:32) 
He that spared not even His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not also, with Him, given us all things?

(Romans 8:33) 
Who shall bring a charge against the elect of God? It is God Who justifies.

(Romans 8:34) 
Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus Who has died, yes, Who is risen again, Who is at the right hand of God, Who also makes intercession for us.

(Romans 8:35) 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or persecution? or famine? or nakedness? or peril? or the sword?

(Romans 8:36) 
As it is written: For Your sake we are put to death all the day long: we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.

(Romans 8:37) 
But in all these things, we overcome, because of Him Who loved us.

(Romans 8:38) 
For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,

(Romans 8:39) 
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 9:1) 
I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, because my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit,

(Romans 9:2) 
because I feel great sadness, and constant grief in my heart.

(Romans 9:3) 
I pray that I myself could be cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood, the Jews:

(Romans 9:4) 
who are Israelites; to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the worship, and the promises:

(Romans 9:5) 
to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, came Christ. May God, Who is over all, be blessed forever. Amen.

(Romans 9:6) 
But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are from Israel are truly Israel,

(Romans 9:7) 
and not all of Abraham’s descendants are his children, but “through Isaac shall your descendants be named.”

(Romans 9:8) 
This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.

(Romans 9:9) 
For the word of promise was this: “About this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”

(Romans 9:10) 
And not only that, but also Rebecca, when she had conceived children by one husband, our father Isaac,

(Romans 9:11) 
(though they were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad) so that God’s purpose of election might continue,

(Romans 9:12) 
not because of works but because of the One who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”

(Romans 9:13) 
As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”

(Romans 9:14) 
What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not.

(Romans 9:15) 
For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”

(Romans 9:16) 
So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, Who has mercy.

(Romans 9:17) 
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”

(Romans 9:18) 
So then He has mercy on whomever He wills, and He hardens whomever He wills.

(Romans 9:19) 
You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?”

(Romans 9:20) 
But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?”

(Romans 9:21) 
Does not the potter have power over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?

(Romans 9:22) 
What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known His power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,

(Romans 9:23) 
in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy, which He has prepared beforehand for glory—

(Romans 9:24) 
even us whom He has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?

(Romans 9:25) 
As indeed He says in Hosea, “Those who were not My people I will call ‘My people,’ and she who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”

(Romans 9:26) 
“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ there they will be called sons of the living God.”

(Romans 9:27) 
And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant of them will be saved,

(Romans 9:28) 
for the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth in righteousness and quickly.”

(Romans 9:29) 
And as Isaiah predicted, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us offspring, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”

(Romans 9:30) 
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith,

(Romans 9:31) 
but that Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, did not attain that law.

(Romans 9:32) 
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,

(Romans 9:33) 
as it is written, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame.”

(Romans 10:1) 
Brothers and sisters, I have a heartfelt desire for the salvation of those in Israel, and I pray to God for them.

(Romans 10:2) 
For I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to the knowledge of God.

(Romans 10:3) 
For they do not understand the righteousness of God, and they want to establish their own, and so they are not obedient to the righteousness of God.

(Romans 10:4) 
For Christ is the fulfillment of the Law, bringing righteousness to everyone who believes.

(Romans 10:5) 
For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”

(Romans 10:6) 
But the righteousness that comes from faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into the universe?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down).

(Romans 10:7) 
“Or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).

(Romans 10:8) 
But what does it say? “The Son is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” (that is, the word of faith that we preach).

(Romans 10:9) 
Because, if you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

(Romans 10:10) 
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

(Romans 10:11) 
For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”

(Romans 10:12) 
For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, rich unto all who call upon Him.

(Romans 10:13) 
For whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

(Romans 10:14) 
How, then, can they call on Him whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

(Romans 10:15) 
And how are they to preach unless they are sent on a mission by God? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring good news!”

(Romans 10:16) 
But not all have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”

(Romans 10:17) 
So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

(Romans 10:18) 
But I ask: Did they not hear? Yes, truly, their sound went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.

(Romans 10:19) 
But I ask: Did Israel not know? First Moses says, “I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will provoke you.”

(Romans 10:20) 
Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”

(Romans 10:21) 
But to Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”

(Romans 11:1) 
So here’s what I mean: Did God reject His people? Absolutely not! I, too, am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.

(Romans 11:2) 
God didn't reject His people, whom He knew ahead of time. Don't you know what Scripture says about Elijah? He pleaded with God against Israel, saying:

(Romans 11:3) 
“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.”

(Romans 11:4) 
But what was the divine answer to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bent the knee to Baal.”

(Romans 11:5) 
So, in the same way, at the present time there is a remnant, a remnant who were saved by the grace of God.

(Romans 11:6) 
Now, if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.

(Romans 11:7) 
What then? What Israel was seeking, it has not obtained, but the elect have obtained it; the rest were blinded.

(Romans 11:8) 
(As it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.”)

(Romans 11:9) 
And David says: “Let their table become a snare before them, a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution for them.

(Romans 11:10) 
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and their backs bowed down always.”

(Romans 11:11) 
So I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Absolutely not! But because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel envious.

(Romans 11:12) 
Now if their transgression means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness bring?

(Romans 11:13) 
Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,

(Romans 11:14) 
in the hope that I may provoke my own flesh to envy and save some of them.

(Romans 11:15) 
For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?

(Romans 11:16) 
If the first fruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

(Romans 11:17) 
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,

(Romans 11:18) 
do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.

(Romans 11:19) 
Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”

(Romans 11:20) 
That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not be arrogant, but fear.

(Romans 11:21) 
For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He will not spare you either.

(Romans 11:22) 
See then the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.

(Romans 11:23) 
And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

(Romans 11:24) 
For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?

(Romans 11:25) 
I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you will not be conceited: A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.

(Romans 11:26) 
And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will banish ungodliness from Jacob.”

(Romans 11:27) 
“And this will be My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”

(Romans 11:28) 
As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.

(Romans 11:29) 
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

(Romans 11:30) 
For just as you disobeyed God in the past but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,

(Romans 11:31) 
so they too have now disobeyed, so that by the mercy shown to you, they also may now receive mercy.

(Romans 11:32) 
For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He may have mercy on all.

(Romans 11:33) 
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!

(Romans 11:34) 
“For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor?”

(Romans 11:35) 
“Or who has first given to Him, that He should be repaid?”

(Romans 11:36) 
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever. Amen.

(Romans 12:1) 
Therefore, brothers, I implore you by God's compassion: offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God. This is your true worship.

(Romans 12:2) 
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind. Then you will be able to discern the will of God—what is good, pleasing, and perfect.

(Romans 12:3) 
For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned.

(Romans 12:4) 
For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,

(Romans 12:5) 
so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.

(Romans 12:6) 
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;

(Romans 12:7) 
if service, in service; the one who teaches, in teaching;

(Romans 12:8) 
the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with diligence; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.

(Romans 12:9) 
Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good.

(Romans 12:10) 
Love one another with brotherly affection; outdo one another in showing honor.

(Romans 12:11) 
Never flag in zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord.

(Romans 12:12) 
Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.

(Romans 12:13) 
Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.

(Romans 12:14) 
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.

(Romans 12:15) 
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.

(Romans 12:16) 
Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; never be wise in your own sight.

(Romans 12:17) 
Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.

(Romans 12:18) 
If possible, so far as it depends upon you, live peaceably with all.

(Romans 12:19) 
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.

(Romans 12:20) 
To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”

(Romans 12:21) 
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

(Romans 13:1) 
Everyone should be obedient to the governing authorities. No authority exists that doesn’t come from God. The authorities that do exist are established by God.

(Romans 13:2) 
Consequently, whoever resists authority is resisting God’s will, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.

(Romans 13:3) 
Leaders are not a terror to good behavior, but to evil. Would you like to be unafraid of authority? Do good, and you will have praise from it.

(Romans 13:4) 
For the governing authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do evil, be afraid, for the authority doesn’t carry the sword for nothing. It is God’s servant to execute wrath on anyone who does evil.

(Romans 13:5) 
So it is necessary to be obedient, not only because of God's wrath, but also because of your conscience.

(Romans 13:6) 
For this reason you also pay taxes. For the authorities are ministers of God, serving you by these things.

(Romans 13:7) 
Give to everyone what is owed: Taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

(Romans 13:8) 
Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another. For whoever loves their neighbor has fulfilled the Law.

(Romans 13:9) 
For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Romans 13:10) 
Love does no evil to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.

(Romans 13:11) 
Do this, knowing the time. It is now the hour to awaken from sleep. For salvation is closer to us now than when we first believed.

(Romans 13:12) 
The night is far gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of light.

(Romans 13:13) 
Let us walk honestly, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual relations and indecency, not in strife and envy.

(Romans 13:14) 
Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its desires.

(Romans 14:1) 
Welcome those who are weak in the faith, but do not argue about questionable matters.

(Romans 14:2) 
One person believes he can eat anything. Someone who is weak, however, eats only vegetables.

(Romans 14:3) 
The one who eats should not despise the one who does not. The one who does not eat should not judge the one who does. God welcomes both.

(Romans 14:4) 
Who are you to judge someone else's servant? The servant stands or falls before his own master. And he will stand, for God has the power to make him stand.

(Romans 14:5) 
One person values one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.

(Romans 14:6) 
The one who values the day, does so in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.

(Romans 14:7) 
For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself.

(Romans 14:8) 
If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.

(Romans 14:9) 
For this is why Christ died and came back to life, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

(Romans 14:10) 
But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

(Romans 14:11) 
For it is written: “As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will give praise to God.”

(Romans 14:12) 
So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.

(Romans 14:13) 
Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.

(Romans 14:14) 
I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.

(Romans 14:15) 
For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.

(Romans 14:16) 
So do not let your good be slandered.

(Romans 14:17) 
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 14:18) 
For whoever serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.

(Romans 14:19) 
So then, let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.

(Romans 14:20) 
Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. All things indeed are clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make others stumble by what he eats.

(Romans 14:21) 
It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles.

(Romans 14:22) 
The faith that you have, have as your own conviction before God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in what he approves.

(Romans 14:23) 
But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.

(Romans 15:1) 
And we who are strong in faith must bear with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not seek to please ourselves.

(Romans 15:2) 
Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, for building up.

(Romans 15:3) 
For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The reproaches of those who reproach You fell on Me.”

(Romans 15:4) 
For whatever things were written, were written for our teaching, that through patience and the consolation of the Scriptures, we may have hope.

(Romans 15:5) 
Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be of one mind with one another, according to Jesus Christ:

(Romans 15:6) 
That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 15:7) 
Therefore, receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.

(Romans 15:8) 
For I say that Christ Jesus has been a servant to the circumcision for the sake of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the fathers,

(Romans 15:9) 
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: “Therefore I will give thanks to You among the Gentiles, and sing to Your name.”

(Romans 15:10) 
And again, he says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”

(Romans 15:11) 
And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him.”

(Romans 15:12) 
And again, Isaiah says: “There shall be the root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles shall hope.”

(Romans 15:13) 
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 15:14) 
And I myself am confident concerning you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.

(Romans 15:15) 
But I have written to you more boldly, brothers, in some measure, as recalling you to your minds, because of the grace given to me by God,

(Romans 15:16) 
That I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, sanctifying the Gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 15:17) 
Therefore, I have glory in Christ Jesus concerning the things of God.

(Romans 15:18) 
For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,

(Romans 15:19) 
In the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fulfilled the Gospel of Christ.

(Romans 15:20) 
And I have preached the Gospel in this way, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another’s foundation,

(Romans 15:21) 
But as it is written: “They to whom He was not announced, shall see: and those who have not heard, shall understand.”

(Romans 15:22) 
Because of this also I have been hindered many times from coming to you.

(Romans 15:23) 
But now, not having any more place in these regions, and having a desire to come to you for many years,

(Romans 15:24) 
Whenever I go to Spain, I hope that by passing through you, I may see you and be helped on my way there by you, after I have first enjoyed your company for a while.

(Romans 15:25) 
But now I am going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.

(Romans 15:26) 
For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.

(Romans 15:27) 
For it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they also ought to minister to them in material things.

(Romans 15:28) 
Therefore, when I have finished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will pass through you into Spain.

(Romans 15:29) 
But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

(Romans 15:30) 
Now I beg you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,

(Romans 15:31) 
That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints.

(Romans 15:32) 
That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.

(Romans 15:33) 
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

(Romans 16:1) 
I commend to you Phoebe, a sister of ours who serves the church in Cenchrae:

(Romans 16:2) 
Welcome her in the Lord, as is fitting for the saints. Assist her with whatever business she needs. She has been a patron of many, including me.

(Romans 16:3) 
Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

(Romans 16:4) 
who risked their necks for my life. I thank not only them but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

(Romans 16:5) 
Also greet the church that meets in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first in Asia to believe in Christ.

(Romans 16:6) 
Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.

(Romans 16:7) 
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and fellow prisoners, who are well-known among the apostles and were in Christ before I was.

(Romans 16:8) 
Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.

(Romans 16:9) 
Greet Urban, our fellow worker in Christ Jesus, and my beloved Stachys.

(Romans 16:10) 
Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those of the household of Aristobulus.

(Romans 16:11) 
Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.

(Romans 16:12) 
Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.

(Romans 16:13) 
Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

(Romans 16:14) 
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them.

(Romans 16:15) 
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

(Romans 16:16) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.

(Romans 16:17) 
Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned, and turn away from them.

(Romans 16:18) 
For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and they deceive the hearts of the innocent with smooth talk and flattery.

(Romans 16:19) 
Your obedience has become known to everyone. Therefore, I rejoice over you, and I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.

(Romans 16:20) 
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

(Romans 16:21) 
Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, greet you.

(Romans 16:22) 
I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord.

(Romans 16:23) 
Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you.

(Romans 16:24) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.

(Romans 16:25) 
Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret for ages,

(Romans 16:26) 
but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations—

(Romans 16:27) 
to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen.

(1 Corinthians 1:1) 
Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother, 

(1 Corinthians 1:2) 
to the Church of God in Corinth: to those who are consecrated to Christ Jesus, called to be holy, and to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place, their place and ours: 

(1 Corinthians 1:3) 
Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:4) 
I give thanks to my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus:

(1 Corinthians 1:5) 
that in everything you have been enriched in Him, in all speech and in all knowledge;

(1 Corinthians 1:6) 
just as the testimony of Christ has been confirmed in you:

(1 Corinthians 1:7) 
so that you are not lacking in any grace, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:8) 
He will also strengthen you until the end, blameless in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:9) 
God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

(1 Corinthians 1:10) 
Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment.

(1 Corinthians 1:11) 
For it has been signified to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

(1 Corinthians 1:12) 
Now this I say, that each of you says: "I am of Paul," and "I am of Apollos," and "I am of Cephas," and "I am of Christ."

(1 Corinthians 1:13) 
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

(1 Corinthians 1:14) 
I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,

(1 Corinthians 1:15) 
lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.

(1 Corinthians 1:16) 
And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other.

(1 Corinthians 1:17) 
For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the Gospel: not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be emptied.

(1 Corinthians 1:18) 
For the word of the cross, to those who are perishing, is foolishness; but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.

(1 Corinthians 1:19) 
For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will reject the prudence of the prudent."

(1 Corinthians 1:20) 
Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

(1 Corinthians 1:21) 
For since, in God's wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching.

(1 Corinthians 1:22) 
For indeed, the Jews seek signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom:

(1 Corinthians 1:23) 
but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness,

(1 Corinthians 1:24) 
but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

(1 Corinthians 1:25) 
Because that which is foolish of God is wiser than men, and that which is weak of God is stronger than men.

(1 Corinthians 1:26) 
For consider your calling, brothers, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not many noble:

(1 Corinthians 1:27) 
but God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God chose the weak things of the world to confound the strong:

(1 Corinthians 1:28) 
and the base things of the world and the things that are despised God has chosen, and those things that are not, to bring to nothing those things that are:

(1 Corinthians 1:29) 
so that no flesh should glory in His sight.

(1 Corinthians 1:30) 
But of Him, you are in Christ Jesus, Who has been made our wisdom from God, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:

(1 Corinthians 1:31) 
so that, as it is written: "Let him who glories, glory in the Lord."

(1 Corinthians 2:1) 
And when I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with fancy words or human wisdom, when I told you about the testimony of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 2:2) 
For I decided that I would know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.

(1 Corinthians 2:3) 
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in great trembling.

(1 Corinthians 2:4) 
And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

(1 Corinthians 2:5) 
so that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:6) 
However, we speak wisdom among those who are spiritually mature: but the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are being destroyed,

(1 Corinthians 2:7) 
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which has been hidden, which God foreordained before the ages for our glory:

(1 Corinthians 2:8) 
which none of the rulers of this age knew; for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

(1 Corinthians 2:9) 
But as it is written, “What the eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.”

(1 Corinthians 2:10) 
But God has revealed to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:11) 
For who of men knows what is in a man, except the spirit of a man that is in him? So also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:12) 
Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God:

(1 Corinthians 2:13) 
And we speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual ones.

(1 Corinthians 2:14) 
The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

(1 Corinthians 2:15) 
But he that is spiritual judges all things; yet he himself is judged by no one.

(1 Corinthians 2:16) 
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 3:1) 
And I, brothers, couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to those of the flesh, as to babies in Christ.

(1 Corinthians 3:2) 
I gave you milk to drink, not solid food. You couldn’t yet digest the harder truths of the Gospel. And you still aren’t able, for you still aren’t capable of it.

(1 Corinthians 3:3) 
For you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and fighting among you, aren’t you carnal, and do you walk according to worldly standards?

(1 Corinthians 3:4) 
For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” aren’t you merely men?

(1 Corinthians 3:5) 
So what then is Paul? And what is Apollos? They are ministers through whom you believed, and to each one as the Lord gave to him.

(1 Corinthians 3:6) 
I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

(1 Corinthians 3:7) 
So neither the one who plants is anything, nor the one who waters, but God, who gives the increase.

(1 Corinthians 3:8) 
Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own work.

(1 Corinthians 3:9) 
For we are fellow workers with God. You are God's field, you are God's building.

(1 Corinthians 3:10) 
According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.

(1 Corinthians 3:11) 
For no one can lay any other foundation besides that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.

(1 Corinthians 3:12) 
Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

(1 Corinthians 3:13) 
the work of each one will be revealed. For the Day of the Lord will declare it, because it will be revealed in fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has built.

(1 Corinthians 3:14) 
If anyone's work remains which he has built on, he will receive a reward.

(1 Corinthians 3:15) 
If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

(1 Corinthians 3:16) 
Don’t you know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?

(1 Corinthians 3:17) 
If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.

(1 Corinthians 3:18) 
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.

(1 Corinthians 3:19) 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”

(1 Corinthians 3:20) 
And again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”

(1 Corinthians 3:21) 
Therefore, let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:

(1 Corinthians 3:22) 
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future—all are yours,

(1 Corinthians 3:23) 
and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.

(1 Corinthians 4:1) 
Everyone should regard us as emissaries of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.

(1 Corinthians 4:2) 
Furthermore, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.

(1 Corinthians 4:3) 
It matters very little to me if I’m judged by you or by any human court. I don’t even judge myself.

(1 Corinthians 4:4) 
I’m not aware of anything I’ve done wrong, but that doesn’t mean I’m right. The Lord is the one who will judge me.

(1 Corinthians 4:5) 
So don’t make judgments before the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will reveal the motives of the heart. Then each person will receive their praise from God.

(1 Corinthians 4:6) 
Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn through us not to go beyond what is written, so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against the other.

(1 Corinthians 4:7) 
For who makes you different from others? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?

(1 Corinthians 4:8) 
Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings—and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings, so that we also might rule with you!

(1 Corinthians 4:9) 
For it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as men condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.

(1 Corinthians 4:10) 
We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!

(1 Corinthians 4:11) 
To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, and homeless.

(1 Corinthians 4:12) 
We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;

(1 Corinthians 4:13) 
when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.

(1 Corinthians 4:14) 
I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.

(1 Corinthians 4:15) 
For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 4:16) 
Therefore I urge you to imitate me.

(1 Corinthians 4:17) 
For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, as I teach it everywhere in every church.

(1 Corinthians 4:18) 
Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.

(1 Corinthians 4:19) 
But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people say, but also what power they have.

(1 Corinthians 4:20) 
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk, but of power.

(1 Corinthians 4:21) 
What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or shall I come with love and with a gentle spirit?

(1 Corinthians 5:1) 
It is reported that there is unchastity among you, and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles, so that a man has his father's wife.

(1 Corinthians 5:2) 
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you?

(1 Corinthians 5:3) 
I indeed, being absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him who has so done,

(1 Corinthians 5:4) 
In the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of Our Lord Jesus,

(1 Corinthians 5:5) 
To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of Our Lord Jesus.

(1 Corinthians 5:6) 
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump?

(1 Corinthians 5:7) 
Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover is sacrificed.

(1 Corinthians 5:8) 
Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

(1 Corinthians 5:9) 
I wrote to you in an epistle: Not to keep company with fornicators.

(1 Corinthians 5:10) 
I meant not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the idolaters; otherwise you must have gone out of this world.

(1 Corinthians 5:11) 
But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one do not eat.

(1 Corinthians 5:12) 
For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do you not judge them that are within?

(1 Corinthians 5:13) 
For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.

(1 Corinthians 6:1) 
Does anyone among you, who has a case against another, dare to go to court before the unbelievers, and not before the saints?

(1 Corinthians 6:2) 
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

(1 Corinthians 6:3) 
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more things of this world?

(1 Corinthians 6:4) 
So if you have worldly judgements, then appoint those who are least esteemed in the Church to judge these matters.

(1 Corinthians 6:5) 
I speak this to your shame. Is there not a wise man among you who can judge between his brother and his brother?

(1 Corinthians 6:6) 
But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.

(1 Corinthians 6:7) 
Now indeed there is utter failure among you, because you have lawsuits with one another. Why do you not rather suffer wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?

(1 Corinthians 6:8) 
But you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that among your brothers.

(1 Corinthians 6:9) 
Do you not know that the unjust will not possess the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,

(1 Corinthians 6:10) 
nor the effeminate, nor those who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will possess the kingdom of God.

(1 Corinthians 6:11) 
And such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.

(1 Corinthians 6:12) 
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.

(1 Corinthians 6:13) 
Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

(1 Corinthians 6:14) 
And God raised up the Lord, and He will also raise us up by His power.

(1 Corinthians 6:15) 
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.

(1 Corinthians 6:16) 
Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For “the two,” He says, “shall be one flesh.”

(1 Corinthians 6:17) 
But he who is joined to God is one spirit with Him.

(1 Corinthians 6:18) 
Flee from fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.

(1 Corinthians 6:19) 
Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?

(1 Corinthians 6:20) 
For you were bought at a great price. Therefore glorify God in your body.

(1 Corinthians 7:1) 
Concerning the things you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman, which means not to engage in sexual relations.

(1 Corinthians 7:2) 
But in order to avoid the temptation of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:3) 
Let the husband give to the wife what is owed to her; and in the same way, let the wife give what is owed to the husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:4) 
The wife does not have power over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have power over his own body, but the wife does.

(1 Corinthians 7:5) 
Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to prayer. Return to each other, so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

(1 Corinthians 7:6) 
Now I say this as a concession, not as a command.

(1 Corinthians 7:7) 
For I wish that all men were like myself. But each one has his own gift from God: one in this way, and another in that.

(1 Corinthians 7:8) 
But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain as I do.

(1 Corinthians 7:9) 
But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.

(1 Corinthians 7:10) 
But to those who are joined in marriage, I command—not I, but the Lord: that a wife should not depart from her husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:11) 
But if she departs, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband divorce his wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:12) 
To the rest I say—not the Lord—that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, let him not divorce her.

(1 Corinthians 7:13) 
And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, let her not divorce the husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:14) 
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.

(1 Corinthians 7:15) 
But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not subject to servitude in such cases. But God has called us to peace.

(1 Corinthians 7:16) 
For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?

(1 Corinthians 7:17) 
But as God has allotted to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And this is what I teach in all the churches.

(1 Corinthians 7:18) 
Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not seek to reverse it. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.

(1 Corinthians 7:19) 
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is what matters.

(1 Corinthians 7:20) 
Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called.

(1 Corinthians 7:21) 
Were you called as a slave? Do not worry about it. But if you can become free, avail yourself of the opportunity.

(1 Corinthians 7:22) 
For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord; likewise, the one who was called as a free man is a slave of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 7:23) 
You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.

(1 Corinthians 7:24) 
So then, brothers, in whatever state each was called, there let him remain with God.

(1 Corinthians 7:25) 
Now concerning virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give an opinion, as one who has received mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.

(1 Corinthians 7:26) 
I think then that this is good on account of the present distress, that it is good for a man to be as he is.

(1 Corinthians 7:27) 
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:28) 
But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such people will have trouble in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you.

(1 Corinthians 7:29) 
But this I say, brothers: the time is short. From now on, let those who have wives be as though they had none,

(1 Corinthians 7:30) 
and those who weep as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess,

(1 Corinthians 7:31) 
and those who make use of the world as though they did not make full use of it, for the form of this world is passing away.

(1 Corinthians 7:32) 
I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:33) 
But the one who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how to please his wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:34) 
And there is a division. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both body and spirit. But the one who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how to please her husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:35) 
I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is proper and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:36) 
If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do as he wishes; he does not sin; let them marry.

(1 Corinthians 7:37) 
But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no necessity, but having control over his own will, and has determined in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.

(1 Corinthians 7:38) 
So then, he who gives his virgin in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage does better.

(1 Corinthians 7:39) 
A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:40) 
But in my judgment, she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

(1 Corinthians 8:1) 
Now about the things that have been sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge by itself causes pride, but charity builds up the Church.

(1 Corinthians 8:2) 
If anyone thinks he knows something, he doesn’t yet know it the way he should.

(1 Corinthians 8:3) 
But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.

(1 Corinthians 8:4) 
Concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God except for the One God.

(1 Corinthians 8:5) 
Even if there are those who are called gods, whether in the sky or on the earth, as there are many gods and many lords:

(1 Corinthians 8:6) 
For us, there is only one God the Father, from whom all things come and in whom we live; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and through whom we live.

(1 Corinthians 8:7) 
But not everyone has this knowledge. Some, through their attachment to idols, eat food that has been sacrificed to idols, and because their conscience is weak, they are defiled.

(1 Corinthians 8:8) 
Food does not recommend us to God. For if we eat, we are not better; and if we do not eat, we are not worse off.

(1 Corinthians 8:9) 
But be careful that your freedom of conscience does not become an occasion of stumbling for the weak.

(1 Corinthians 8:10) 
For if someone sees you who has knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, won’t the conscience of the weak man be emboldened to eat food sacrificed to idols?

(1 Corinthians 8:11) 
So by your knowledge, the weak brother will be destroyed, because Christ died for him.

(1 Corinthians 8:12) 
When you sin against your brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

(1 Corinthians 8:13) 
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, lest I cause my brother to stumble.

(1 Corinthians 9:1) 
Am I not an Apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ Our Lord? Are you not the fruit of my ministry in the Lord?

(1 Corinthians 9:2) 
Even if I am not an Apostle to others, I am certainly one to you. You are proof that I am an Apostle of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 9:3) 
To those who question me, this is my defense:

(1 Corinthians 9:4) 
Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

(1 Corinthians 9:5) 
Do we not have the right to take a wife, a sister in the faith, as do the other Apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

(1 Corinthians 9:6) 
Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right to stop working to support ourselves?

(1 Corinthians 9:7) 
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

(1 Corinthians 9:8) 
Am I speaking merely as a man? Does not the Law also speak these things?

(1 Corinthians 9:9) 
For it is written in the Law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?

(1 Corinthians 9:10) 
Or does He speak entirely for our sake? Indeed, it was written for our sake, so that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of receiving a share of the harvest.

(1 Corinthians 9:11) 
If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things?

(1 Corinthians 9:12) 
If others share in your rights, why not even more so we? But we have not used this right. We endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 9:13) 
Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings?

(1 Corinthians 9:14) 
In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should live by the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 9:15) 
But I have not used any of these rights, nor am I writing this in order that it may be done for me. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.

(1 Corinthians 9:16) 
For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because an obligation is laid on me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!

(1 Corinthians 9:17) 
For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a commission.

(1 Corinthians 9:18) 
What then is my reward? That, in preaching the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 9:19) 
For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.

(1 Corinthians 9:20) 
To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.

(1 Corinthians 9:21) 
To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ), that I might win those outside the law.

(1 Corinthians 9:22) 
To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

(1 Corinthians 9:23) 
I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with it.

(1 Corinthians 9:24) 
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.

(1 Corinthians 9:25) 
Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.

(1 Corinthians 9:26) 
So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.

(1 Corinthians 9:27) 
But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.

(1 Corinthians 10:1) 
And so, my brothers, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the protection of the cloud, and all crossed through the sea,

(1 Corinthians 10:2) 
and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea:

(1 Corinthians 10:3) 
and all ate the same spiritual food,

(1 Corinthians 10:4) 
and all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.

(1 Corinthians 10:5) 
But in many of them, God was not pleased; for they were struck down in the desert.

(1 Corinthians 10:6) 
These things happened as examples for us, so that we would not be eager for evil things, as they desired them.

(1 Corinthians 10:7) 
Do not become idolaters, as some of them did, as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.”

(1 Corinthians 10:8) 
Nor should we engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.

(1 Corinthians 10:9) 
Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.

(1 Corinthians 10:10) 
Nor should you grumble, as some of them grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.

(1 Corinthians 10:11) 
These things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.

(1 Corinthians 10:12) 
Therefore, let whoever thinks he stands, take heed that he does not fall.

(1 Corinthians 10:13) 
No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. But God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but with the temptation will also make a way out, that you may be able to endure it.

(1 Corinthians 10:14) 
Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.

(1 Corinthians 10:15) 
I speak as to the wise: judge for yourselves what I say.

(1 Corinthians 10:16) 
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the participation of the body of Christ?

(1 Corinthians 10:17) 
Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.

(1 Corinthians 10:18) 
Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

(1 Corinthians 10:19) 
What do I say then? That an idol is anything, or that which is sacrificed to idols is anything?

(1 Corinthians 10:20) 
No, but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to become partners with demons.

(1 Corinthians 10:21) 
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

(1 Corinthians 10:22) 
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?

(1 Corinthians 10:23) 
“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things edify.

(1 Corinthians 10:24) 
Let no one seek his own, but that of another.

(1 Corinthians 10:25) 
Eat anything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:26) 
“The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.”

(1 Corinthians 10:27) 
If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:28) 
But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:29) 
I mean conscience, not your own, but the other person’s; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?

(1 Corinthians 10:30) 
If I partake with thanks, why am I blasphemed for that for which I give thanks?

(1 Corinthians 10:31) 
So then, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

(1 Corinthians 10:32) 
Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,

(1 Corinthians 10:33) 
just as I also please all men in everything, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

(1 Corinthians 11:1) 
Imitate me, even as I imitate Christ.

(1 Corinthians 11:2) 
I commend you, brothers, for always remembering me and for keeping the teachings that I handed down to you.

(1 Corinthians 11:3) 
I want you to understand this: every man has Christ as his head, a woman has a man as her head, and Christ has God as His head.

(1 Corinthians 11:4) 
Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.

(1 Corinthians 11:5) 
And any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, because it is as though she had her head shaved.

(1 Corinthians 11:6) 
For if a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, then she should cover it.

(1 Corinthians 11:7) 
A man, since he is the image and glory of God, shouldn't have his head covered. But woman is the glory of man.

(1 Corinthians 11:8) 
For man wasn't created from woman, but woman from man.

(1 Corinthians 11:9) 
Man wasn't created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.

(1 Corinthians 11:10) 
That is why a woman should have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.

(1 Corinthians 11:11) 
Nevertheless, neither is woman independent of man in the Lord, nor is man independent of woman.

(1 Corinthians 11:12) 
For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But all things are from God.

(1 Corinthians 11:13) 
Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

(1 Corinthians 11:14) 
Doesn't nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,

(1 Corinthians 11:15) 
but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair has been given to her for a covering.

(1 Corinthians 11:16) 
But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.

(1 Corinthians 11:17) 
But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.

(1 Corinthians 11:18) 
For first of all, when you come together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.

(1 Corinthians 11:19) 
For there must be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be evident among you.

(1 Corinthians 11:20) 
So then, when you meet together, it is not really to eat the Lord's Supper.

(1 Corinthians 11:21) 
For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own supper, and one person is hungry while another is drunk.

(1 Corinthians 11:22) 
Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.

(1 Corinthians 11:23) 
For I received from the Lord what I also handed down to you: that the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread,

(1 Corinthians 11:24) 
and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

(1 Corinthians 11:25) 
In the same way He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

(1 Corinthians 11:26) 
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.

(1 Corinthians 11:27) 
Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 11:28) 
But a man must examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

(1 Corinthians 11:29) 
For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.

(1 Corinthians 11:30) 
For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are dying.

(1 Corinthians 11:31) 
But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.

(1 Corinthians 11:32) 
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned with the world.

(1 Corinthians 11:33) 
So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

(1 Corinthians 11:34) 
If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. And the remaining matters I will arrange when I come.

(1 Corinthians 12:1) 
Regarding spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.

(1 Corinthians 12:2) 
You know that when you were Gentiles, you were being led astray, running to idols, which cannot speak, as you were led.

(1 Corinthians 12:3) 
Therefore, I make it known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says: “Jesus is accursed.” And no one can say “Lord Jesus” except in the Holy Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:4) 
Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:5) 
And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.

(1 Corinthians 12:6) 
And there are varieties of workings, but it is the same God who works all things in all.

(1 Corinthians 12:7) 
To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.

(1 Corinthians 12:8) 
For to one, through the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:

(1 Corinthians 12:9) 
to another, faith in the same Spirit; to another, the grace of healings in the one Spirit:

(1 Corinthians 12:10) 
to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discernment of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of words.

(1 Corinthians 12:11) 
But all these things are worked by one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one individually as He wills.

(1 Corinthians 12:12) 
For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ.

(1 Corinthians 12:13) 
For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free; and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:14) 
For the body is not one member, but many.

(1 Corinthians 12:15) 
If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” it is not therefore not of the body?

(1 Corinthians 12:16) 
And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” it is not therefore not of the body?

(1 Corinthians 12:17) 
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?

(1 Corinthians 12:18) 
But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, as He willed.

(1 Corinthians 12:19) 
If all were one member, where would the body be?

(1 Corinthians 12:20) 
Now indeed there are many members, but one body.

(1 Corinthians 12:21) 
The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”

(1 Corinthians 12:22) 
Rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are more necessary.

(1 Corinthians 12:23) 
And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable, these we surround with greater honor; and those parts that are unpresentable, we have the greater honor.

(1 Corinthians 12:24) 
But the parts that are honorable have no need. But God has tempered the body together, giving greater honor to the one which lacked honor,

(1 Corinthians 12:25) 
so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.

(1 Corinthians 12:26) 
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

(1 Corinthians 12:27) 
Now you are the body of Christ, and members of His body.

(1 Corinthians 12:28) 
And God has appointed in the Church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.

(1 Corinthians 12:29) 
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?

(1 Corinthians 12:30) 
Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?

(1 Corinthians 12:31) 
But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.

(1 Corinthians 13:1) 
If I speak in the tongues of men, or even of angels, but do not have love, then I have become like a noisy gong, or a clanging cymbal.

(1 Corinthians 13:2) 
And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, then I am nothing.

(1 Corinthians 13:3) 
And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.

(1 Corinthians 13:4) 
Love endures with patience, and is kind. Love does not envy, does not parade itself, is not puffed up,

(1 Corinthians 13:5) 
is not ambitious, does not seek its own, is not provoked to anger, and does not think evil,

(1 Corinthians 13:6) 
does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices with the truth.

(1 Corinthians 13:7) 
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

(1 Corinthians 13:8) 
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will be done away; whether there are tongues, they will cease; or whether there is knowledge, it will be destroyed.

(1 Corinthians 13:9) 
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

(1 Corinthians 13:10) 
But when that which is perfect comes, then that which is in part will be done away.

(1 Corinthians 13:11) 
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things.

(1 Corinthians 13:12) 
For now we see through a glass in a dark manner, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part; but then I will know as I also am known.

(1 Corinthians 13:13) 
And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

(1 Corinthians 14:1) 
Pursue love. Be eager for the gifts of the Spirit, especially the gift of prophecy.

(1 Corinthians 14:2) 
Anyone who speaks in a language that no one understands is speaking to God, not to people. No one understands him. He is speaking mysteries in the Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 14:3) 
But the one who prophesies speaks to people, to build them up, encourage them, and comfort them.

(1 Corinthians 14:4) 
Anyone who speaks in a language that no one understands builds up himself. But the one who prophesies builds up the Church of God.

(1 Corinthians 14:5) 
I wish all of you spoke in languages, but even more that you prophesied. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in languages, unless he interprets, so that the Church may be built up.

(1 Corinthians 14:6) 
Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in languages, how will I help you unless I speak to you in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?

(1 Corinthians 14:7) 
Even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, must give a clear sound if they are to be understood. How will anyone know what is being played?

(1 Corinthians 14:8) 
If the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?

(1 Corinthians 14:9) 
So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will be speaking into the air.

(1 Corinthians 14:10) 
There are perhaps many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.

(1 Corinthians 14:11) 
If I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker a foreigner to me.

(1 Corinthians 14:12) 
So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, seek to abound in them for the building up of the Church.

(1 Corinthians 14:13) 
Therefore, anyone who speaks in a language should pray that he may interpret it.

(1 Corinthians 14:14) 
For if I pray in a language, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.

(1 Corinthians 14:15) 
So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.

(1 Corinthians 14:16) 
Otherwise, if you give thanks in the Spirit, how can the one who is present as an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?

(1 Corinthians 14:17) 
For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.

(1 Corinthians 14:18) 
I give thanks to God that I speak in languages more than all of you.

(1 Corinthians 14:19) 
But in the church, I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a language.

(1 Corinthians 14:20) 
Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your understanding. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.

(1 Corinthians 14:21) 
In the Law it is written: “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 14:22) 
So languages are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.

(1 Corinthians 14:23) 
So if the whole Church comes together and all speak in languages, and some unbelievers or uninstructed people come in, will they not say that you are mad?

(1 Corinthians 14:24) 
But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in, he is convicted by all and is judged by all.

(1 Corinthians 14:25) 
And so the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is really among you.

(1 Corinthians 14:26) 
What then, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.

(1 Corinthians 14:27) 
If anyone speaks in a language, let there be only two or at most three, and let them speak one at a time, and let someone interpret.

(1 Corinthians 14:28) 
But if there is no one to interpret, let the speaker keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.

(1 Corinthians 14:29) 
Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.

(1 Corinthians 14:30) 
If anything is revealed to another sitting nearby, let the first one be silent.

(1 Corinthians 14:31) 
For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.

(1 Corinthians 14:32) 
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

(1 Corinthians 14:33) 
For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

(1 Corinthians 14:34) 
let the women keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law says.

(1 Corinthians 14:35) 
If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.

(1 Corinthians 14:36) 
Did the word of God originate with you? Or has it come only to you?

(1 Corinthians 14:37) 
If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 14:38) 
If anyone does not recognize them, he will not be recognized.

(1 Corinthians 14:39) 
So, brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in languages.

(1 Corinthians 14:40) 
But all things should be done decently and in order.

(1 Corinthians 15:1) 
Brothers, I want you to know the Gospel that I preached to you, that you received, and in which you stand,

(1 Corinthians 15:2) 
by which you are saved, if you hold fast to the Gospel that I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.

(1 Corinthians 15:3) 
For I delivered to you first of all what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

(1 Corinthians 15:4) 
and that He was buried, and that He rose on the third day according to the Scriptures,

(1 Corinthians 15:5) 
and that He was seen by Cephas, and then by the eleven.

(1 Corinthians 15:6) 
After that, He was seen by more than five hundred brothers at once; most of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep.

(1 Corinthians 15:7) 
Then He was seen by James, and then by all the Apostles.

(1 Corinthians 15:8) 
And last of all, as to one untimely born, He was seen by me also.

(1 Corinthians 15:9) 
For I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

(1 Corinthians 15:10) 
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace in me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God with me.

(1 Corinthians 15:11) 
Whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

(1 Corinthians 15:12) 
Now if Christ is preached as having been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

(1 Corinthians 15:13) 
For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either.

(1 Corinthians 15:14) 
And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain.

(1 Corinthians 15:15) 
We are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if the dead do not rise.

(1 Corinthians 15:16) 
For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised either.

(1 Corinthians 15:17) 
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.

(1 Corinthians 15:18) 
Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

(1 Corinthians 15:19) 
If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.

(1 Corinthians 15:20) 
But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

(1 Corinthians 15:21) 
For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.

(1 Corinthians 15:22) 
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.

(1 Corinthians 15:23) 
But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then those who are Christ's at His coming.

(1 Corinthians 15:24) 
Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed every rule and every authority and power.

(1 Corinthians 15:25) 
For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

(1 Corinthians 15:26) 
The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

(1 Corinthians 15:27) 
For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.

(1 Corinthians 15:28) 
When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who put all things in subjection to Him, so that God may be all in all.

(1 Corinthians 15:29) 
Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are people baptized for them?

(1 Corinthians 15:30) 
And why are we in danger every hour?

(1 Corinthians 15:31) 
I protest by your boasting, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die every day.

(1 Corinthians 15:32) 
If, after the manner of men, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead do not rise, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”

(1 Corinthians 15:33) 
Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

(1 Corinthians 15:34) 
Wake up to righteousness and do not sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.

(1 Corinthians 15:35) 
But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”

(1 Corinthians 15:36) 
Fool! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

(1 Corinthians 15:37) 
And what you sow, you do not sow that body which shall be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.

(1 Corinthians 15:38) 
But God gives it a body as He has willed, and to each seed a body of its own.

(1 Corinthians 15:39) 
All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh for humans, another flesh for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.

(1 Corinthians 15:40) 
There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies, but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

(1 Corinthians 15:41) 
There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

(1 Corinthians 15:42) 
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.

(1 Corinthians 15:43) 
It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.

(1 Corinthians 15:44) 
It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.

(1 Corinthians 15:45) 
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

(1 Corinthians 15:46) 
So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.

(1 Corinthians 15:47) 
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.

(1 Corinthians 15:48) 
The first man was from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven.

(1 Corinthians 15:49) 
As was the earthly man, so are those who are earthly; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are heavenly.

(1 Corinthians 15:50) 
And just as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.

(1 Corinthians 15:51) 
Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.

(1 Corinthians 15:52) 
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,

(1 Corinthians 15:53) 
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.

(1 Corinthians 15:54) 
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

(1 Corinthians 15:55) 
But when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

(1 Corinthians 15:56) 
“O Death, where is your victory? O Hades, where is your sting?”

(1 Corinthians 15:57) 
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.

(1 Corinthians 15:58) 
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 15:59) 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 16:1) 
Now, regarding the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches in Galatia, so also you should do.

(1 Corinthians 16:2) 
On the first day of the week, let each of you put aside and store up whatever he may have been blessed with, so that there be no collections when I come.

(1 Corinthians 16:3) 
And when I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters, to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.

(1 Corinthians 16:4) 
If it is fitting that I go as well, they will go with me.

(1 Corinthians 16:5) 
I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia.

(1 Corinthians 16:6) 
Perhaps I will stay with you for a time, or even spend the winter with you, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.

(1 Corinthians 16:7) 
For I do not want to see you just in passing; I hope to remain with you for a while, if the Lord allows.

(1 Corinthians 16:8) 
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.

(1 Corinthians 16:9) 
For a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many adversaries.

(1 Corinthians 16:10) 
If Timothy comes, see that he is without fear among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.

(1 Corinthians 16:11) 
Therefore, let no one despise him, but send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers.

(1 Corinthians 16:12) 
Now, concerning our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing to come now; but he will come when he has the opportunity.

(1 Corinthians 16:13) 
Be vigilant, stand firm in the faith, act like men, and be strong.

(1 Corinthians 16:14) 
Let all that you do be done in love.

(1 Corinthians 16:15) 
Now I urge you, brothers: you know that the household of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, are the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints.

(1 Corinthians 16:16) 
I ask that you be subject to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them.

(1 Corinthians 16:17) 
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.

(1 Corinthians 16:18) 
They have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, acknowledge such people.

(1 Corinthians 16:19) 
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, salute you warmly in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 16:20) 
All the brothers salute you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

(1 Corinthians 16:21) 
The greeting is with my own hand—Paul’s.

(1 Corinthians 16:22) 
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Maran atha!

(1 Corinthians 16:23) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

(1 Corinthians 16:24) 
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.

(2 Corinthians 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, to the Church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all of Achaia:

(2 Corinthians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be granted to you by God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Corinthians 1:3) 
Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all consolation,

(2 Corinthians 1:4) 
who comforts us in all our tribulation, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

(2 Corinthians 1:5) 
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also our consolation abounds through Christ.

(2 Corinthians 1:6) 
Whether we are afflicted, it is for your exhortation and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your consolation, which produces the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer:

(2 Corinthians 1:7) 
so that our hope for you may be steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the consolation.

(2 Corinthians 1:8) 
For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our affliction which came upon us in Asia, that we were crushed beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.

(2 Corinthians 1:9) 
But we ourselves had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God, who raises the dead;

(2 Corinthians 1:10) 
who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver, on whom we have set our hope that He will also deliver us again,

(2 Corinthians 1:11) 
while you also help us by prayer, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift bestowed on us through the prayers of many.

(2 Corinthians 1:12) 
For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in carnal wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.

(2 Corinthians 1:13) 
For we are not writing anything to you other than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand completely,

(2 Corinthians 1:14) 
as you have also understood us in part, that we are your glory, even as you are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.

(2 Corinthians 1:15) 
Because of this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,

(2 Corinthians 1:16) 
and to pass through you to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way toward Judea.

(2 Corinthians 1:17) 
When I had planned this, did I do so lightly? Or do I make plans according to the flesh, so that with me there is yes and no?

(2 Corinthians 1:18) 
But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.

(2 Corinthians 1:19) 
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in Him it was yes.

(2 Corinthians 1:20) 
For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.

(2 Corinthians 1:21) 
Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,

(2 Corinthians 1:22) 
who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.

(2 Corinthians 1:23) 
But I call on God as witness to my soul, that to spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.

(2 Corinthians 1:24) 
Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for in faith you stand firm.

(2 Corinthians 2:1) 
This is my own decision: I will not visit you with sadness again.

(2 Corinthians 2:2) 
Because if I cause you grief, who is there to make me joyful, except for the one who suffers grief from me?

(2 Corinthians 2:3) 
This is why I wrote to you, so that I will not have grief when I arrive, from those who should be my joy. I have confidence in all of you, because my joy is the joy of you all.

(2 Corinthians 2:4) 
For I wrote to you with great affliction and anguish of heart, through many tears: not to cause you grief, but so you know how much love I have for you.

(2 Corinthians 2:5) 
Now, if anyone has caused grief, it has not been me, but in part, so as not to burden all of you.

(2 Corinthians 2:6) 
It is enough for such a person to be rebuked, as he has been by most of you.

(2 Corinthians 2:7) 
Instead, you should forgive him and console him, lest he is overwhelmed by excessive grief.

(2 Corinthians 2:8) 
So, I ask you to reaffirm your love for him.

(2 Corinthians 2:9) 
I wrote to you for this very purpose: to see if you are obedient in all things.

(2 Corinthians 2:10) 
If you forgive anyone, I also forgive. Because whatever I have forgiven, I have forgiven it for you, in the person of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 2:11) 
So that we are not taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.

(2 Corinthians 2:12) 
When I went to Troas to preach the Gospel of Christ, and a door was opened for me in the Lord,

(2 Corinthians 2:13) 
I had no rest in my spirit because I didn't find my brother Titus. So I said goodbye to them and set off for Macedonia.

(2 Corinthians 2:14) 
But thanks be to God, who always gives us the victory in Christ, and manifests the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place.

(2 Corinthians 2:15) 
For we are the aroma of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:

(2 Corinthians 2:16) 
to some, it is the scent of death leading to death, and to others, the scent of life leading to life. And who is worthy of this?

(2 Corinthians 2:17) 
We are not like so many others who are corrupting the word of God. Instead, we speak with sincerity, from God, before God, in Christ.

(2 Corinthians 3:1) 
Are we now starting again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?

(2 Corinthians 3:2) 
You are our letter of recommendation, written in our hearts, which all men know and read:

(2 Corinthians 3:3) 
It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, prepared through our ministry, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on the tablets of the flesh of the heart.

(2 Corinthians 3:4) 
And such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God:

(2 Corinthians 3:5) 
Not that we are sufficient to think of anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God:

(2 Corinthians 3:6) 
Who also made us capable ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.

(2 Corinthians 3:7) 
Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stone, was in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look upon the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which glory was passing:

(2 Corinthians 3:8) 
How much more will the ministry of the Spirit be with glory?

(2 Corinthians 3:9) 
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more abounds in glory the ministry of justice.

(2 Corinthians 3:10) 
For indeed that which was made glorious has not been glorified in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.

(2 Corinthians 3:11) 
For if that which passes away was glorious, much more that which remains is in glory.

(2 Corinthians 3:12) 
Therefore, having such a hope, we use much confidence:

(2 Corinthians 3:13) 
And not as Moses put a veil over his face, so that the children of Israel could not look at the end of that which was passing.

(2 Corinthians 3:14) 
But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil in the reading of the Old Testament remains unremoved, because in Christ it is done away.

(2 Corinthians 3:15) 
But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is still placed upon their heart.

(2 Corinthians 3:16) 
But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.

(2 Corinthians 3:17) 
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

(2 Corinthians 3:18) 
But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 4:1) 
Therefore, since we have received this work of ministry, by God's mercy, we don't give up;

(2 Corinthians 4:2) 
but we avoid the hidden tricks of shame, we don't distort the Word of God, and we speak the truth in the open, recommending ourselves to every human conscience before God.

(2 Corinthians 4:3) 
If our Gospel is veiled, it is hidden from those who are perishing;

(2 Corinthians 4:4) 
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, lest the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ shine through, who is the image of God.

(2 Corinthians 4:5) 
For we don't preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ Our Lord: but we declare ourselves to be your servants for Jesus' sake.

(2 Corinthians 4:6) 
Because God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to enlighten the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

(2 Corinthians 4:7) 
But we have this treasure in clay vessels: so that the preeminence of the power may be of God, and not of us.

(2 Corinthians 4:8) 
In all things we suffer tribulation, but we are not distressed; we are in doubt, but we don't despair;

(2 Corinthians 4:9) 
we are persecuted, but we are not abandoned; we are cast down, but we don't perish:

(2 Corinthians 4:10) 
always carrying about in our body the mortification of Jesus: so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our bodies.

(2 Corinthians 4:11) 
For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake: so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.

(2 Corinthians 4:12) 
Therefore, death is at work in us, but life in you.

(2 Corinthians 4:13) 
But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: "I believed, therefore I spoke," we also believe, therefore we speak:

(2 Corinthians 4:14) 
knowing that He who raised up Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you.

(2 Corinthians 4:15) 
For all things are for you, so that the abundance of grace, by many thanksgivings, may abound to the glory of God.

(2 Corinthians 4:16) 
Therefore we don't give up: but even though our outer man is decaying, our inner man is renewed day by day.

(2 Corinthians 4:17) 
For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, works for us, above all measure, an eternal weight of glory:

(2 Corinthians 4:18) 
as we don't look at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.

(2 Corinthians 5:1) 
We know that when our earthly body dies, God has a building prepared for us. It's not made by human hands but eternal in heaven.

(2 Corinthians 5:2) 
We groan in our bodies, longing to be clothed in a heavenly dwelling.

(2 Corinthians 5:3) 
We hope that when we are clothed, we are not found naked of good works.

(2 Corinthians 5:4) 
Indeed, we groan under the weight of this tent we call our body. Not that we want to be unclothed but rather clothed in new life, so that what is mortal is swallowed up by life eternal.

(2 Corinthians 5:5) 
God, who prepared us for this, has given us the Holy Spirit as a pledge.

(2 Corinthians 5:6) 
So we are always confident, knowing that while we are in the body, we are away from the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 5:7) 
We walk by faith, not by sight.

(2 Corinthians 5:8) 
We are confident and prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 5:9) 
So we make it our aim to please Him, whether at home or away.

(2 Corinthians 5:10) 
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what he has done in the body, whether good or bad.

(2 Corinthians 5:11) 
Knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people, and God knows our hearts. I hope that you understand us too.

(2 Corinthians 5:12) 
We are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so you can answer those who boast about outward appearance and not their inner hearts.

(2 Corinthians 5:13) 
For whether we are out of our minds, it is for God; or whether we are sober, it is for you.

(2 Corinthians 5:14) 
The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all; therefore all have died.

(2 Corinthians 5:15) 
And He died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised.

(2 Corinthians 5:16) 
From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once knew Christ according to the flesh, we no longer know Him that way.

(2 Corinthians 5:17) 
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

(2 Corinthians 5:18) 
All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.

(2 Corinthians 5:19) 
God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.

(2 Corinthians 5:20) 
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

(2 Corinthians 5:21) 
For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

(2 Corinthians 6:1) 
We are working together, and we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.

(2 Corinthians 6:2) 
For He says, "In an acceptable time, I have heard you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.

(2 Corinthians 6:3) 
We give no offense to anyone, so that the ministry may not be blamed.

(2 Corinthians 6:4) 
But in everything, we are showing ourselves to be ministers of God: through much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses,

(2 Corinthians 6:5) 
in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings,

(2 Corinthians 6:6) 
in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,

(2 Corinthians 6:7) 
in the word of truth, in the power of God: through the weapons of justice on the right and on the left,

(2 Corinthians 6:8) 
through glory and dishonor, through ill repute and good repute. We are treated as deceivers, and yet we are truthful;

(2 Corinthians 6:9) 
as unknown, and yet we are well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed;

(2 Corinthians 6:10) 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.

(2 Corinthians 6:11) 
Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians; our heart is enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 6:12) 
You are not limited in us, but you are limited in your own affections.

(2 Corinthians 6:13) 
Now for the same recompense (I speak as to my children), be you also enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 6:14) 
Do not be yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?

(2 Corinthians 6:15) 
What harmony does Christ have with Belial? Or what does a believer share with an unbeliever?

(2 Corinthians 6:16) 
What agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: "I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."

(2 Corinthians 6:17) 
Therefore, "Come out from among them, and be separate," says the Lord, "and touch no unclean thing. And I will receive you,"

(2 Corinthians 6:18) 
"And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me," says the Lord Almighty.

(2 Corinthians 7:1) 
Since we have God's promises, beloved ones, let us purify ourselves from all sin, which stains the flesh and the soul. Let us finish the work of spiritual growth, which is born of reverent fear of God.

(2 Corinthians 7:2) 
Open up your hearts to us. We haven’t harmed anyone. We haven’t corrupted anyone. We haven’t taken advantage of anyone.

(2 Corinthians 7:3) 
I don’t mean to accuse anyone. I’ve already said that you have a place in our hearts, for us to live and die with.

(2 Corinthians 7:4) 
I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am overflowing with consolation, and I am filled with joy in the midst of all our suffering.

(2 Corinthians 7:5) 
Because when we came to Macedonia, we got no rest. We were attacked on all sides. There was conflict all around us, and anxiety within.

(2 Corinthians 7:6) 
But God, who comforts the afflicted, comforted us when Titus arrived.

(2 Corinthians 7:7) 
His arrival wasn’t the only comfort, but we were consoled by the comfort he received from you. He told us about your longing to see us, your grief, and your zeal for me, so that I was even more joyful.

(2 Corinthians 7:8) 
Even though I saddened you in the letter, I don’t regret it. I do regret it, because that letter, although it was painful for a time, did sadden you.

(2 Corinthians 7:9) 
Now I am joyful, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened to the point of repentance. Because you were saddened in the right way, according to God's will, so that you suffered no loss from us.

(2 Corinthians 7:10) 
For grief that is according to God brings repentance that leads to salvation, which will never be regretted. But the grief of the world brings death.

(2 Corinthians 7:11) 
See what this very thing—that you were saddened in the right way, according to God's will—has produced in you: great diligence, a defense of your character, indignation against sin, fear of God, longing to be reconciled, zeal for doing good, and a readiness to punish the offender. You have shown yourselves to be blameless in the matter.

(2 Corinthians 7:12) 
So, even though I wrote the letter, it wasn’t for the sake of the one who did wrong or the one who was wronged. I wrote so that you might understand the great care we have for you, as shown in the sight of God.

(2 Corinthians 7:13) 
This is why we were comforted. And in our comfort, we rejoiced even more because of Titus’s joy, for his spirit was refreshed by you all.

(2 Corinthians 7:14) 
For if I had boasted to him about you, I was not ashamed, but just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting about you to Titus has also proven to be true.

(2 Corinthians 7:15) 
And his heart is overflowing with affection for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.

(2 Corinthians 7:16) 
I am rejoicing that I have complete confidence in you in every way.

(2 Corinthians 8:1) 
We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God given to the churches in Macedonia:

(2 Corinthians 8:2) 
During their great suffering, the overflowing joy and their extreme poverty were able to abound in the riches of their generosity.

(2 Corinthians 8:3) 
For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond their ability; they were willing, even beyond their means,

(2 Corinthians 8:4) 
begging us with great insistence for the grace of participating in the service to the saints.

(2 Corinthians 8:5) 
And this was more than we expected, because they gave themselves first to God and then to us, by the will of God.

(2 Corinthians 8:6) 
So we urged Titus to finish what he had started. He was the one who started the grace of giving.

(2 Corinthians 8:7) 
But since you abound in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us, may you also abound in this grace.

(2 Corinthians 8:8) 
I am not commanding you, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the diligence of others.

(2 Corinthians 8:9) 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; though He was rich, for your sake He became poor, so that through His poverty you might become rich.

(2 Corinthians 8:10) 
And I give my judgment in this matter: it is to your advantage to finish what you began a year ago, and to do so with enthusiasm.

(2 Corinthians 8:11) 
Now, finish doing it, so that your readiness to give may be matched by your eagerness to give out of what you have.

(2 Corinthians 8:12) 
If the willingness is there, the offering is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.

(2 Corinthians 8:13) 
For I do not want you to be burdened while others are relieved, but that there should be equality.

(2 Corinthians 8:14) 
At the present time, your abundance should supply their need, so that their abundance may also supply your need; then there will be equality.

(2 Corinthians 8:15) 
As it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”

(2 Corinthians 8:16) 
But thanks be to God, who put the same diligence for you into the heart of Titus.

(2 Corinthians 8:17) 
For he accepted the exhortation, but he is even more diligent and comes to you of his own accord.

(2 Corinthians 8:18) 
We are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in the Gospel.

(2 Corinthians 8:19) 
Moreover, he was appointed by the churches to travel with us as we administer this grace for the glory of the Lord and to show our eagerness to help.

(2 Corinthians 8:20) 
We are careful to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this generous offering.

(2 Corinthians 8:21) 
We are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of others.

(2 Corinthians 8:22) 
We are sending along with them our brother, whom we have often tested in many matters and found eager, but who is now even more eager because of his great trust in you.

(2 Corinthians 8:23) 
As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. As for our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 8:24) 
Therefore, show these men the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you, before the face of the churches.

(2 Corinthians 9:1) 
Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it's unnecessary for me to write to you about it.

(2 Corinthians 9:2) 
For I know your willing spirit, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your enthusiasm has stirred up many others.

(2 Corinthians 9:3) 
I sent the brothers so that our boasting about you might not be in vain in this regard, but that, as I said, you might be prepared.

(2 Corinthians 9:4) 
Otherwise, when I come with the Macedonians and find you unprepared, we (not to say you) would be ashamed in this matter.

(2 Corinthians 9:5) 
Therefore, I considered it necessary to ask the brothers to go ahead of you to you, and prepare this promised blessing, so that it may be ready as a blessing and not as a matter of greed.

(2 Corinthians 9:6) 
I say this: The one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and the one who sows generously will also reap generously.

(2 Corinthians 9:7) 
Each one must give as they have determined in their heart, not reluctantly or out of compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

(2 Corinthians 9:8) 
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you may abound in every good work.

(2 Corinthians 9:9) 
As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever."

(2 Corinthians 9:10) 
Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.

(2 Corinthians 9:11) 
You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.

(2 Corinthians 9:12) 
For this service of ministering to the needs of the saints is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also abounding with many thanksgivings to God.

(2 Corinthians 9:13) 
Through the proof of this service, they will glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the Gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone.

(2 Corinthians 9:14) 
And in their prayers for you, they long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.

(2 Corinthians 9:15) 
Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift!

(2 Corinthians 10:1) 
And I, Paul, now implore you by the gentleness and humility of Christ. Some people say I seem weak when I am with you in person, but in my absence, I am a stern teacher.

(2 Corinthians 10:2) 
I beg you not to force me to be bold in my teaching. Some say I walk in worldly ways.

(2 Corinthians 10:3) 
Even though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.

(2 Corinthians 10:4) 
The weapons we fight with are not those of this world, but they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments,

(2 Corinthians 10:5) 
and every pretension that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 10:6) 
And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience when your obedience is complete.

(2 Corinthians 10:7) 
You are judging by mere appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.

(2 Corinthians 10:8) 
Even if I boast somewhat more about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.

(2 Corinthians 10:9) 
I do not want you to think I am trying to frighten you with my letters.

(2 Corinthians 10:10) 
Some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person, he is weak, and his speech is of no account.”

(2 Corinthians 10:11) 
Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.

(2 Corinthians 10:12) 
We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.

(2 Corinthians 10:13) 
We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but will keep within the limits of the sphere God has assigned to us, a sphere that reaches even to you.

(2 Corinthians 10:14) 
We are not going too far in our boasting, since we were the first to come to you with the gospel of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 10:15) 
We do not boast beyond measure of other people’s labor, but we hope that as your faith increases, our sphere of activity among you will be enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 10:16) 
We want to preach the gospel to you even more, and go to places beyond you, without boasting in what has already been done in someone else's sphere.

(2 Corinthians 10:17) 
Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 10:18) 
For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.

(2 Corinthians 11:1) 
I wish you would put up with just a little bit of my foolishness! But please bear with me.

(2 Corinthians 11:2) 
I am zealous for you with the zeal of God. I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:3) 
But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts may be corrupted and led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:4) 
For if anyone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it very well.

(2 Corinthians 11:5) 
For I consider that I am in no way inferior to these super-apostles.

(2 Corinthians 11:6) 
Even if I am unskilled in speech, I am not unskilled in knowledge. But in every way we have been fully manifested among you.

(2 Corinthians 11:7) 
Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the Gospel of God to you free of charge?

(2 Corinthians 11:8) 
I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to serve you.

(2 Corinthians 11:9) 
And when I was present with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone. The brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked, and in everything I have kept myself, and will keep myself, from being a burden to you.

(2 Corinthians 11:10) 
As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.

(2 Corinthians 11:11) 
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!

(2 Corinthians 11:12) 
But what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity of those who want an opportunity to be regarded as we are in what they boast about.

(2 Corinthians 11:13) 
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:14) 
And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.

(2 Corinthians 11:15) 
So it is no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.

(2 Corinthians 11:16) 
I say again: Let no one think me foolish. But if you do, then receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.

(2 Corinthians 11:17) 
What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as it were, in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.

(2 Corinthians 11:18) 
Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.

(2 Corinthians 11:19) 
For you gladly put up with fools, being as you are so wise!

(2 Corinthians 11:20) 
For you put up with it if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes advantage of you, if anyone exalts himself, if anyone strikes you in the face.

(2 Corinthians 11:21) 
I say this to my shame, as though we were weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast (I am speaking in foolishness), I also dare to boast.

(2 Corinthians 11:22) 
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.

(2 Corinthians 11:23) 
Are they servants of Christ? (I am speaking as a fool.) I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death.

(2 Corinthians 11:24) 
Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.

(2 Corinthians 11:25) 
Three times I was beaten with rods, I was stoned once, three times I was shipwrecked, and I have spent a night and a day in the open sea.

(2 Corinthians 11:26) 
In journeys often, dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers.

(2 Corinthians 11:27) 
In labor and hardship, through sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often in fasting, in cold and nakedness.

(2 Corinthians 11:28) 
And besides other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.

(2 Corinthians 11:29) 
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with anger?

(2 Corinthians 11:30) 
If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

(2 Corinthians 11:31) 
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.

(2 Corinthians 11:32) 
In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to arrest me.

(2 Corinthians 11:33) 
But I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.

(2 Corinthians 12:1) 
It is necessary for me to boast, though I shouldn't. But I will now speak about the visions and revelations of the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 12:2) 
I know a man in Christ, who was taken up fourteen years ago to the third atmosphere—I do not know whether in the body, or out of the body, God knows.

(2 Corinthians 12:3) 
And I know that this man, whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows,

(2 Corinthians 12:4) 
was snatched up into Paradise. He heard things that cannot be spoken, that no man is allowed to utter.

(2 Corinthians 12:5) 
I will boast about this man. I will not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses.

(2 Corinthians 12:6) 
For even if I wanted to boast, I would not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees in me, or that he hears of me.

(2 Corinthians 12:7) 
And lest the magnitude of the revelations should lift me up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.

(2 Corinthians 12:8) 
Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.

(2 Corinthians 12:9) 
And He said to me: “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.

(2 Corinthians 12:10) 
Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

(2 Corinthians 12:11) 
I have become foolish, you have compelled me. For I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was no way inferior to the most eminent apostles, although I am nothing.

(2 Corinthians 12:12) 
For the signs of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

(2 Corinthians 12:13) 
For what is there that you were inferior to other churches? Except that I myself have not been a burden to you. Forgive me this injury.

(2 Corinthians 12:14) 
Behold, I am ready to come to you the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. For I seek not yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

(2 Corinthians 12:15) 
But I most gladly will spend and be spent for your souls. Though loving you more, I am loved less.

(2 Corinthians 12:16) 
But be it so: I did not burden you: but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.

(2 Corinthians 12:17) 
Did I then make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?

(2 Corinthians 12:18) 
I desired Titus, and I sent a brother with him: did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?

(2 Corinthians 12:19) 
Do you think that all along we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ: but all things, dearly beloved, for your edification.

(2 Corinthians 12:20) 
For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, jealousies, angers, quarrels, detractions, whisperings, swellings of pride, seditions:

(2 Corinthians 12:21) 
Lest, when I come again, God humiliate me among you: and I mourn many of those who before have sinned and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed.

(2 Corinthians 13:1) 
This is the third time I am coming to you. Every matter must be confirmed by the word of two or three witnesses.

(2 Corinthians 13:2) 
I have said this before to those present, and I will say it again to those who are not here, that if I come again, I will not spare you,

(2 Corinthians 13:3) 
because you seek proof that Christ is speaking through me. Christ is not weak in you, but rather, He is strong in you.

(2 Corinthians 13:4) 
For even though He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God within you.

(2 Corinthians 13:5) 
Test yourselves to see if you are living in the faith. Examine yourselves. Or do you not know this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobate?

(2 Corinthians 13:6) 
But I trust that you will recognize that we are not reprobate.

(2 Corinthians 13:7) 
And we pray to God that you may do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but rather, that you should do what is good, even if we are considered reprobate.

(2 Corinthians 13:8) 
For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.

(2 Corinthians 13:9) 
For we rejoice when we are weak: we pray for your perfection.

(2 Corinthians 13:10) 
Therefore, I write these things while absent, so that when I am present, I do not have to act severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for destroying.

(2 Corinthians 13:11) 
Finally, brothers, rejoice, be perfect, be comforted, be of one mind, have peace, and the God of peace and love will be with you.

(2 Corinthians 13:12) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss.

(2 Corinthians 13:13) 
All the saints greet you.

(2 Corinthians 13:14) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

(Galatians 1:1) 
Paul, a sent one (not appointed by humans, nor through a human intermediary, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),

(Galatians 1:2) 
and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.

(Galatians 1:3) 
May grace and peace be given to you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,

(Galatians 1:4) 
who gave Himself to atone for our sins so that we might be rescued from this present evil world, according to the will of God our Father,

(Galatians 1:5) 
to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

(Galatians 1:6) 
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you to experience the grace of Christ, in order to follow a different gospel;

(Galatians 1:7) 
which is not really a gospel at all; some people are troubling you, and want to change the gospel of Christ.

(Galatians 1:8) 
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to evangelize to you anything other than what we evangelized to you, may he be cursed.

(Galatians 1:9) 
As we have said before, so I now say again: If anyone evangelizes to you anything beyond what you have already received, may he be cursed.

(Galatians 1:10) 
Am I now trying to win the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.

(Galatians 1:11) 
For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was evangelized by me is not a human invention.

(Galatians 1:12) 
I did not receive it from any human, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

(Galatians 1:13) 
For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism: how I persecuted the Church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.

(Galatians 1:14) 
And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

(Galatians 1:15) 
But when it pleased Him Who set me apart from birth, and called me through His grace,

(Galatians 1:16) 
to reveal His Son in me, so that I might evangelize Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,

(Galatians 1:17) 
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; rather, I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.

(Galatians 1:18) 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him for fifteen days.

(Galatians 1:19) 
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.

(Galatians 1:20) 
In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie.

(Galatians 1:21) 
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

(Galatians 1:22) 
And I was still unknown in face to the churches of Judea that were in Christ:

(Galatians 1:23) 
they only heard: “The one who formerly persecuted us is now evangelizing the faith that he once tried to destroy.”

(Galatians 1:24) 
And they were glorifying God in me.

(Galatians 2:1) 
Then after fourteen years, I returned to Jerusalem with Barnabas, bringing along Titus as well.

(Galatians 2:2) 
I went up because of a revelation. I presented the Gospel that I preach to the Gentiles, but I did so privately to those who seemed to be important leaders, to be certain that I wasn't running in vain.

(Galatians 2:3) 
But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.

(Galatians 2:4) 
This was because of certain false brothers who were secretly brought in. They were trying to find out about the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, to put us back into slavery.

(Galatians 2:5) 
We did not yield to these men for a single hour, nor did we give in to them. We did this so the truth of the Gospel would remain with you.

(Galatians 2:6) 
And from those who seemed to be something, it makes no difference to me what they once were—God shows no partiality. These so-called leaders added nothing to my Gospel.

(Galatians 2:7) 
On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the Gospel for the circumcised.

(Galatians 2:8) 
(For the one who worked through Peter in his ministry to the circumcised also worked through me among the Gentiles:)

(Galatians 2:9) 
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.

(Galatians 2:10) 
All they asked was that we should remember the poor, which is what I was very eager to do.

(Galatians 2:11) 
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.

(Galatians 2:12) 
Before certain men came from James, Peter used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself, because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.

(Galatians 2:13) 
The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.

(Galatians 2:14) 
When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas in front of everyone, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews?

(Galatians 2:15) 
We are Jews by birth, and not sinners from among the Gentiles;

(Galatians 2:16) 
yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.

(Galatians 2:17) 
But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, then does that mean Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!

(Galatians 2:18) 
For if I rebuild what I have destroyed, I become a transgressor.

(Galatians 2:19) 
For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ.

(Galatians 2:20) 
It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

(Galatians 2:21) 
I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!

(Galatians 3:1) 
O you foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was presented, crucified among you?

(Galatians 3:2) 
This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?

(Galatians 3:3) 
Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?

(Galatians 3:4) 
Have you suffered so many things in vain? If it is indeed in vain.

(Galatians 3:5) 
He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?

(Galatians 3:6) 
As Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

(Galatians 3:7) 
Know therefore that those who are of faith, are the sons of Abraham.

(Galatians 3:8) 
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, announced to Abraham: “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”

(Galatians 3:9) 
Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

(Galatians 3:10) 
For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.”

(Galatians 3:11) 
But that by the Law no one is justified with God is clear, for “the just man lives by faith.”

(Galatians 3:12) 
But the Law is not of faith, but “he who does them shall live in them.”

(Galatians 3:13) 
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having been made a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”

(Galatians 3:14) 
so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

(Galatians 3:15) 
Brothers, I speak in human terms: even though it is only a man’s covenant, when it has been ratified, no one annuls it or adds to it.

(Galatians 3:16) 
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as referring to many, but as to one, “And to your seed,” who is Christ.

(Galatians 3:17) 
Now I say this: The Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise invalid.

(Galatians 3:18) 
For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no longer of promise; but God granted it to Abraham through promise.

(Galatians 3:19) 
Why then the Law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made, having been ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.

(Galatians 3:20) 
Now a mediator is not for one only, but God is one.

(Galatians 3:21) 
Is the Law then against the promises of God? By no means! For if a law had been given which could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the Law.

(Galatians 3:22) 
But the Scripture has confined all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

(Galatians 3:23) 
But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, confined until the faith which was to be revealed would come.

(Galatians 3:24) 
Therefore the Law was our tutor in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

(Galatians 3:25) 
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.

(Galatians 3:26) 
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 3:27) 
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.

(Galatians 3:28) 
There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor free; there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 3:29) 
And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

(Galatians 4:1) 
I mean, as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a servant, even though he owns everything,

(Galatians 4:2) 
but he is under guardians and managers until the time fixed by his father.

(Galatians 4:3) 
So too, when we were children, we were enslaved to the basic principles of this world.

(Galatians 4:4) 
But when the time had fully come, God sent forth the Son on a mission by God, born of a woman, born under the Law,

(Galatians 4:5) 
to redeem those who were under the Law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.

(Galatians 4:6) 
And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son on a mission by God into our hearts, crying out, “Abba! Father!”

(Galatians 4:7) 
So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.

(Galatians 4:8) 
However, formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods.

(Galatians 4:9) 
But now that you have known God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them again?

(Galatians 4:10) 
You observe days and months and seasons and years.

(Galatians 4:11) 
I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.

(Galatians 4:12) 
Become like me, because I also became like you, brothers. I beg you: you have done me no wrong.

(Galatians 4:13) 
You know that because of a physical illness I preached the gospel to you at first.

(Galatians 4:14) 
And though my condition was a trial for you, you did not despise or reject me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 4:15) 
What has become of your blessedness? For I testify that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.

(Galatians 4:16) 
So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?

(Galatians 4:17) 
They make much of you, but not in a good way; they want to shut you out, so that you will make much of them.

(Galatians 4:18) 
It is always good to be made much of, in a good way, and not only when I am present with you,

(Galatians 4:19) 
My children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!

(Galatians 4:20) 
I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.

(Galatians 4:21) 
Tell me, you who want to be under the Law, do you not listen to the Law?

(Galatians 4:22) 
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.

(Galatians 4:23) 
But the son of the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.

(Galatians 4:24) 
This is an allegory: for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.

(Galatians 4:25) 
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.

(Galatians 4:26) 
But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.

(Galatians 4:27) 
For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor; for the children of the desolate one are more than those of the one who has a husband.”

(Galatians 4:28) 
Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.

(Galatians 4:29) 
But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also now.

(Galatians 4:30) 
But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”

(Galatians 4:31) 
So, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.

(Galatians 5:1) 
Be free, therefore! Christ freed us. Do not be enslaved again.

(Galatians 5:2) 
I, Paul, say this: if you are circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way.

(Galatians 5:3) 
I testify again to any man who is circumcised that he is obligated to keep the whole Law.

(Galatians 5:4) 
You have been severed from Christ, all of you who try to become justified by the Law; you have fallen from grace.

(Galatians 5:5) 
We eagerly await through the Spirit, by faith, the hope of righteousness.

(Galatians 5:6) 
For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.

(Galatians 5:7) 
You were running well. Who stopped you from obeying the truth?

(Galatians 5:8) 
This kind of persuasion does not come from the One who called you.

(Galatians 5:9) 
A little bit of yeast leavens the whole lump.

(Galatians 5:10) 
I am confident in you in the Lord that you will think in no other way; but the one who is troubling you will pay the penalty, whoever he may be.

(Galatians 5:11) 
As for me, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.

(Galatians 5:12) 
I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!

(Galatians 5:13) 
For you were called to freedom, brothers. But do not use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another through love.

(Galatians 5:14) 
For the whole Law is fulfilled in one statement: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Galatians 5:15) 
But if you bite and devour one another, see that you are not consumed by one another.

(Galatians 5:16) 
But I say: walk in the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.

(Galatians 5:17) 
For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want.

(Galatians 5:18) 
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.

(Galatians 5:19) 
Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,

(Galatians 5:20) 
idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,

(Galatians 5:21) 
envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

(Galatians 5:22) 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control;

(Galatians 5:23) 
against such things there is no law.

(Galatians 5:24) 
Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

(Galatians 5:25) 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

(Galatians 5:26) 
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

(Galatians 6:1) 
Brothers, if a man is caught in some sin, you who are spiritual should correct him with the spirit of gentleness, being mindful of yourself, lest you also be tempted.

(Galatians 6:2) 
Carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

(Galatians 6:3) 
For if anyone thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

(Galatians 6:4) 
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have his boasting in himself alone, and not in another.

(Galatians 6:5) 
For each one will bear his own burden.

(Galatians 6:6) 
Let the one who is taught in the word share all good things with the one who teaches.

(Galatians 6:7) 
Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.

(Galatians 6:8) 
For he who sows to his flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

(Galatians 6:9) 
And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we do not give up.

(Galatians 6:10) 
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, but especially to those who are of the household of faith.

(Galatians 6:11) 
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.

(Galatians 6:12) 
Those who want to make a good show in the flesh are the ones who try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

(Galatians 6:13) 
For even those who are circumcised do not keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.

(Galatians 6:14) 
But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

(Galatians 6:15) 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but a new creation.

(Galatians 6:16) 
And as for all who will follow this rule, may peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.

(Galatians 6:17) 
From now on, let no one bother me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.

(Galatians 6:18) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.

(Ephesians 1:1) 
Paul, a commissioned apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the holy ones who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.

(Ephesians 1:2) 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Ephesians 1:3) 
Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the universe, in Christ,

(Ephesians 1:4) 
even as He chose us in Him before the beginning of the universe, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love,

(Ephesians 1:5) 
who predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the purpose of His will,

(Ephesians 1:6) 
to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He has graced us in His beloved Son.

(Ephesians 1:7) 
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins according to the riches of His grace,

(Ephesians 1:8) 
which He poured out on us in all wisdom and prudence,

(Ephesians 1:9) 
making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him,

(Ephesians 1:10) 
to be carried out in the fullness of time: that He would bring all things together in Christ, those in the universe and those on the earth—in Him;

(Ephesians 1:11) 
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,

(Ephesians 1:12) 
so that we who first hoped in Christ might be to the praise of His glory.

(Ephesians 1:13) 
In Him, you also, after listening to the word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation—in Him, after you also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

(Ephesians 1:14) 
who is the pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.

(Ephesians 1:15) 
For this reason I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love for all the saints,

(Ephesians 1:16) 
do not cease to give thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers,

(Ephesians 1:17) 
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,

(Ephesians 1:18) 
the eyes of your heart being enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,

(Ephesians 1:19) 
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, in accordance with the working of the strength of His might,

(Ephesians 1:20) 
which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the universe,

(Ephesians 1:21) 
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

(Ephesians 1:22) 
And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the Church,

(Ephesians 1:23) 
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

(Ephesians 2:1) 
When you were dead, because of your sins and failings,

(Ephesians 2:2) 
you lived according to the ways of the world. You followed the devil, the prince of the power of the air, the evil spirit who now works in those who do not believe,

(Ephesians 2:3) 
Like them, we all once lived in the desires of our flesh, doing what our flesh and minds wanted. We were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else.

(Ephesians 2:4) 
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us,

(Ephesians 2:5) 
made us alive with Christ, even when we were dead in sins. God saved you by his grace.

(Ephesians 2:6) 
And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavens,

(Ephesians 2:7) 
to show in the ages to come the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

(Ephesians 2:8) 
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,

(Ephesians 2:9) 
not because of works, lest anyone should boast.

(Ephesians 2:10) 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

(Ephesians 2:11) 
Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is done in the flesh by hands,

(Ephesians 2:12) 
were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

(Ephesians 2:13) 
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

(Ephesians 2:14) 
For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility

(Ephesians 2:15) 
by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace,

(Ephesians 2:16) 
and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.

(Ephesians 2:17) 
And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.

(Ephesians 2:18) 
For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

(Ephesians 2:19) 
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,

(Ephesians 2:20) 
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,

(Ephesians 2:21) 
in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.

(Ephesians 2:22) 
In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

(Ephesians 3:1) 
For this cause, I, Paul, the one imprisoned for the sake of Jesus Christ for the sake of you who are not Jews—

(Ephesians 3:2) 
Assuming you’ve heard about the special plan of God’s grace, which was given to me for your sake:

(Ephesians 3:3) 
That by a direct revelation, I have come to understand the mystery of the Church—just as I have written briefly above—

(Ephesians 3:4) 
By reading this, you will see my insight into the mystery of Christ.

(Ephesians 3:5) 
This mystery was not made known to those who lived in past generations, but now it has been revealed to the holy apostles and prophets, through the Holy Spirit:

(Ephesians 3:6) 
That the non-Jews are co-heirs and members of the same body, who share in the promises in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel:

(Ephesians 3:7) 
Of this Gospel, I have become a servant, through the gift of God’s grace, which was given to me through the working of His power.

(Ephesians 3:8) 
This grace was given to me, who is the least of all the saints: that I should announce the good news of Christ’s riches to all the non-Jewish nations.

(Ephesians 3:9) 
And to give understanding of what is the plan of this mystery, which was hidden for all time in God, who created all things.

(Ephesians 3:10) 
The purpose of this is that, now, the principalities and powers in the universe may come to know the many forms of God’s wisdom, through the Church.

(Ephesians 3:11) 
This plan was according to the eternal intention, which He made in Christ Jesus Our Lord:

(Ephesians 3:12) 
In Him we have confidence, and through faith in Him, we are free to approach God.

(Ephesians 3:13) 
So I ask that you do not be discouraged by my sufferings for your sake, which is your glory.

(Ephesians 3:14) 
Because of this, I bow my knees before the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ,

(Ephesians 3:15) 
From whom all family in the universe, and on the earth, are named.

(Ephesians 3:16) 
May He grant that you, according to the riches of His glory, be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner self,

(Ephesians 3:17) 
That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; may you be rooted and grounded in love,

(Ephesians 3:18) 
So that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth—

(Ephesians 3:19) 
To know also the surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

(Ephesians 3:20) 
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,

(Ephesians 3:21) 
To Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

(Ephesians 4:1) 
So I, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

(Ephesians 4:2) 
Be humble and gentle, be patient, bearing with one another in love,

(Ephesians 4:3) 
make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

(Ephesians 4:4) 
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called,

(Ephesians 4:5) 
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

(Ephesians 4:6) 
one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.

(Ephesians 4:7) 
But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.

(Ephesians 4:8) 
This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to mankind.”

(Ephesians 4:9) 
(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?

(Ephesians 4:10) 
He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)

(Ephesians 4:11) 
So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,

(Ephesians 4:12) 
to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up

(Ephesians 4:13) 
until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.

(Ephesians 4:14) 
Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.

(Ephesians 4:15) 
Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.

(Ephesians 4:16) 
From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

(Ephesians 4:17) 
So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.

(Ephesians 4:18) 
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

(Ephesians 4:19) 
Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.

(Ephesians 4:20) 
That, however, is not the way of life you learned

(Ephesians 4:21) 
when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.

(Ephesians 4:22) 
You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;

(Ephesians 4:23) 
to be made new in the attitude of your minds;

(Ephesians 4:24) 
and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

(Ephesians 4:25) 
Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.

(Ephesians 4:26) 
“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,

(Ephesians 4:27) 
and do not give the devil a foothold.

(Ephesians 4:28) 
Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.

(Ephesians 4:29) 
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

(Ephesians 4:30) 
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

(Ephesians 4:31) 
Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

(Ephesians 4:32) 
Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

(Ephesians 5:1) 
So, become imitators of God, as beloved children.

(Ephesians 5:2) 
And walk in love, just as Christ loved us, and offered Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a pleasing fragrance.

(Ephesians 5:3) 
But fornication and every impurity or greed, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints.

(Ephesians 5:4) 
Or indecency, or foolish talk, or obscenity, which are not becoming, but rather thanksgiving.

(Ephesians 5:5) 
For know and understand this: that every fornicator or impure person or the greedy, who is a servant of idols, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

(Ephesians 5:6) 
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.

(Ephesians 5:7) 
Therefore, do not be partakers with them.

(Ephesians 5:8) 
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light.

(Ephesians 5:9) 
(for the fruit of light is in all goodness and justice and truth),

(Ephesians 5:10) 
proving what is pleasing to God.

(Ephesians 5:11) 
And do not share in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

(Ephesians 5:12) 
For the things done by them in secret, it is shameful even to speak of.

(Ephesians 5:13) 
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.

(Ephesians 5:14) 
For everything that is made manifest is light.

(Ephesians 5:15) 
Therefore, it says: "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you."

(Ephesians 5:16) 
See, therefore, brothers, how carefully you walk: not as unwise,

(Ephesians 5:17) 
but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

(Ephesians 5:18) 
Therefore, do not become foolish, but understanding what the will of God is.

(Ephesians 5:19) 
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is debauchery, but be filled with the Holy Spirit,

(Ephesians 5:20) 
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord,

(Ephesians 5:21) 
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father:

(Ephesians 5:22) 
Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.

(Ephesians 5:23) 
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.

(Ephesians 5:24) 
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church: He is the Savior of His body.

(Ephesians 5:25) 
But as the Church is subject to Christ, so also let wives be to their husbands in all things.

(Ephesians 5:26) 
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself up for her,

(Ephesians 5:27) 
that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word of life,

(Ephesians 5:28) 
that He might present her to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.

(Ephesians 5:29) 
So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

(Ephesians 5:30) 
For no one ever hated his own flesh: but nourishes and cherishes it, as also Christ does the Church:

(Ephesians 5:31) 
because we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.

(Ephesians 5:32) 
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”

(Ephesians 5:33) 
This is a great mystery, and I mean in Christ and in the Church.

(Ephesians 6:1) 
Children, obey your parents in the Lord; this is right.

(Ephesians 6:2) 
“Honor your father and your mother.” This is the first commandment with a promise:

(Ephesians 6:3) 
“that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”

(Ephesians 6:4) 
And, you fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.

(Ephesians 6:5) 
Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:

(Ephesians 6:6) 
Not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,

(Ephesians 6:7) 
Serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men:

(Ephesians 6:8) 
Knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive from the Lord, whether slave or free.

(Ephesians 6:9) 
And, you masters, do the same things to them, remitting threats, knowing that both theirs and yours is the Lord in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.

(Ephesians 6:10) 
For the rest, be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of His might.

(Ephesians 6:11) 
Put on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.

(Ephesians 6:12) 
For we are not wrestling against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual wickedness in the high places.

(Ephesians 6:13) 
Therefore, take up the armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day and, being perfect in all things, to stand.

(Ephesians 6:14) 
Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having put on the breastplate of justice,

(Ephesians 6:15) 
And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:

(Ephesians 6:16) 
In all things, taking up the shield of faith, with which you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

(Ephesians 6:17) 
And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).

(Ephesians 6:18) 
By every prayer and supplication, praying at all times in the spirit, and in this watching with all insistence and supplication for all the saints:

(Ephesians 6:19) 
And for me, that speech may be given to me, in the opening of my mouth, with confidence to make known the mystery of the gospel:

(Ephesians 6:20) 
For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that I may dare to speak it, as I ought to speak.

(Ephesians 6:21) 
But that you also may know the things concerning me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, the most beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you:

(Ephesians 6:22) 
Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.

(Ephesians 6:23) 
Peace to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Ephesians 6:24) 
Grace with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.

(Philippians 1:1) 
Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, send greetings to all the holy ones in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, including their overseers and those who serve them.

(Philippians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be granted to you by God our Father and by the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:3) 
I thank my God whenever I think of you,

(Philippians 1:4) 
always in my every prayer, I pray with joy for all of you,

(Philippians 1:5) 
because you have shared the Gospel from the very first day until now:

(Philippians 1:6) 
I am sure of this: God, who has begun this good work in you, will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:7) 
It is right that I should feel this way about all of you, because I hold you in my heart. You share in God’s grace with me, and you are with me in my imprisonment, and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel.

(Philippians 1:8) 
God is my witness that I long for all of you with the deep love of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:9) 
And I pray that your love may overflow more and more, with knowledge and with all insight,

(Philippians 1:10) 
so that you may discern what is best, and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

(Philippians 1:11) 
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

(Philippians 1:12) 
Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the Gospel,

(Philippians 1:13) 
so that my imprisonment for Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else.

(Philippians 1:14) 
And because of my imprisonment, most of the brothers and sisters have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.

(Philippians 1:15) 
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

(Philippians 1:16) 
The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the Gospel.

(Philippians 1:17) 
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to my distress in my chains.

(Philippians 1:18) 
So what? The important thing is that in every way, whether from wrong motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,

(Philippians 1:19) 
for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.

(Philippians 1:20) 
I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

(Philippians 1:21) 
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

(Philippians 1:22) 
If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!

(Philippians 1:23) 
I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;

(Philippians 1:24) 
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.

(Philippians 1:25) 
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,

(Philippians 1:26) 
so that through my being with you again, your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

(Philippians 1:27) 
Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the Gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the Gospel,

(Philippians 1:28) 
without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be lost, but that you will be saved—and that by God.

(Philippians 1:29) 
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,

(Philippians 1:30) 
since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

(Philippians 2:1) 
If therefore there is any consolation in the Son, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion:

(Philippians 2:2) 
Then complete my joy, by having the same understanding, having the same charity, being of one mind, thinking the same thing:

(Philippians 2:3) 
Let nothing be done through contention, nor by empty glory: but in humility of mind, let each esteem others better than themselves:

(Philippians 2:4) 
Not considering each the things that are his own, but the things that are of others.

(Philippians 2:5) 
For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

(Philippians 2:6) 
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God:

(Philippians 2:7) 
But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.

(Philippians 2:8) 
He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

(Philippians 2:9) 
For which cause also God hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:

(Philippians 2:10) 
That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:

(Philippians 2:11) 
And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

(Philippians 2:12) 
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence, with fear and trembling work out your salvation.

(Philippians 2:13) 
For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.

(Philippians 2:14) 
Do all things without murmurings and hesitations:

(Philippians 2:15) 
That you may be blameless and harmless, children of God without reproach, in the midst of a depraved and perverse nation: among whom you shine as lights in the world,

(Philippians 2:16) 
Holding fast the word of life: that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor labored in vain.

(Philippians 2:17) 
But if I am to be sacrificed upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.

(Philippians 2:18) 
And for the same things do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.

(Philippians 2:19) 
But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.

(Philippians 2:20) 
For I have no one so of one mind, who with sincere care for you, will care about the things that are of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 2:21) 
For all seek the things that are their own, not the things that are of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 2:22) 
But know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.

(Philippians 2:23) 
Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see what shall be about me.

(Philippians 2:24) 
And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you shortly.

(Philippians 2:25) 
But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your apostle and the minister of my need.

(Philippians 2:26) 
Because indeed he longed for you all, and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.

(Philippians 2:27) 
For indeed he was sick, even unto death; but God had mercy on him: and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

(Philippians 2:28) 
I sent him therefore the more diligently, that, seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful.

(Philippians 2:29) 
Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and such as these hold in honor:

(Philippians 2:30) 
Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death, delivering his life, that he might fulfill that which was wanting of your service towards me.

(Philippians 3:1) 
Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you, and it is a safeguard for you.

(Philippians 3:2) 
Watch out for the dogs! Beware of evil workers! Beware of those who mutilate the flesh.

(Philippians 3:3) 
For we are the circumcision, we who worship God in the Spirit, who rejoice in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh

(Philippians 3:4) 
Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:

(Philippians 3:5) 
circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;

(Philippians 3:6) 
as for zeal, persecuting the Church; as for legal righteousness, faultless.

(Philippians 3:7) 
But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.

(Philippians 3:8) 
Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ

(Philippians 3:9) 
and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith

(Philippians 3:10) 
that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,

(Philippians 3:11) 
that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

(Philippians 3:12) 
Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.

(Philippians 3:13) 
Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,

(Philippians 3:14) 
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 3:15) 
Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal this also to you.

(Philippians 3:16) 
Only let us hold true to what we have attained.

(Philippians 3:17) 
Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.

(Philippians 3:18) 
For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.

(Philippians 3:19) 
Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.

(Philippians 3:20) 
But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

(Philippians 3:21) 
who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.

(Philippians 4:1) 
So, my beloved brothers and sisters, whom I love and long to see, you who are my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord, my dear ones.

(Philippians 4:2) 
I urge Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree in the Lord.

(Philippians 4:3) 
And I ask you also, my loyal companion, help these women, for they worked with me in the Gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

(Philippians 4:4) 
Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.

(Philippians 4:5) 
Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.

(Philippians 4:6) 
Have no anxiety about anything; but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

(Philippians 4:7) 
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 4:8) 
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

(Philippians 4:9) 
The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, these do: and the God of peace will be with you.

(Philippians 4:10) 
I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me; though you were concerned before, you lacked an opportunity.

(Philippians 4:11) 
Not that I speak in regard to need; for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.

(Philippians 4:12) 
I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.

(Philippians 4:13) 
I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

(Philippians 4:14) 
Yet it was kind of you to share in my trouble.

(Philippians 4:15) 
And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.

(Philippians 4:16) 
For even in Thessalonica you sent me help more than once when I was in need.

(Philippians 4:17) 
Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.

(Philippians 4:18) 
I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.

(Philippians 4:19) 
My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 4:20) 
To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(Philippians 4:21) 
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me greet you.

(Philippians 4:22) 
All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household.

(Philippians 4:23) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

(Colossians 1:1) 
Paul, sent on a mission by the will of God, along with our brother Timothy,

(Colossians 1:2) 
to the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ living in Colossae. May grace and peace come to you from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Colossians 1:3) 
We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,

(Colossians 1:4) 
because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints,

(Colossians 1:5) 
which is founded on the hope you have in the universe. You learned about this hope through the message of the Gospel, which is the truth,

(Colossians 1:6) 
the same Gospel that has come to you and is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God’s grace in all its truth.

(Colossians 1:7) 
You learned this from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,

(Colossians 1:8) 
and who also told us about your love in the Spirit.

(Colossians 1:9) 
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,

(Colossians 1:10) 
so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,

(Colossians 1:11) 
being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,

(Colossians 1:12) 
and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.

(Colossians 1:13) 
For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,

(Colossians 1:14) 
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

(Colossians 1:15) 
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,

(Colossians 1:16) 
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.

(Colossians 1:17) 
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

(Colossians 1:18) 
And he is the head of the body, the Church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

(Colossians 1:19) 
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,

(Colossians 1:20) 
and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

(Colossians 1:21) 
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.

(Colossians 1:22) 
But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.

(Colossians 1:23) 
If you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

(Colossians 1:24) 
Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church,

(Colossians 1:25) 
I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to present to you the word of God in its fullness.

(Colossians 1:26) 
This mystery, which has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s holy people.

(Colossians 1:27) 
To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

(Colossians 1:28) 
We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.

(Colossians 1:29) 
To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.

(Colossians 2:1) 
I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for everyone who has never seen my face in person.

(Colossians 2:2) 
I want them to be encouraged and united by love, enriched with a full understanding, and with the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father, and of Christ.

(Colossians 2:3) 
In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

(Colossians 2:4) 
I say this so that no one will deceive you with smooth words.

(Colossians 2:5) 
Though I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit. I am glad to see your order and the strength of your faith in Christ.

(Colossians 2:6) 
Therefore, since you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him.

(Colossians 2:7) 
Be rooted and built up in him, and strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness.

(Colossians 2:8) 
Be careful that no one deceives you with philosophy, empty deceit, the tradition of men, the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.

(Colossians 2:9) 
For in Christ lives all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

(Colossians 2:10) 
And you have been filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power.

(Colossians 2:11) 
In him you were also circumcised, but not with a circumcision done by human hands; you were set free from the sinful nature of the body, by the circumcision of Christ.

(Colossians 2:12) 
You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.

(Colossians 2:13) 
And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,

(Colossians 2:14) 
blotting out the written code of the decrees that was against us, which was contrary to us; he took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.

(Colossians 2:15) 
He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

(Colossians 2:16) 
Therefore, do not let anyone judge you in respect to food or drink or in respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath.

(Colossians 2:17) 
These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.

(Colossians 2:18) 
Do not let anyone defraud you of your prize by insisting on self-abasement and the worship of angels, dwelling on things that he has not seen, puffed up without cause by his sensuous mind,

(Colossians 2:19) 
and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

(Colossians 2:20) 
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as though you were still living in the world, do you submit to regulations—

(Colossians 2:21) 
“Do not handle,” “Do not taste,” “Do not touch”

(Colossians 2:22) 
(which all are destined to perish with use)—according to human precepts and teachings?

(Colossians 2:23) 
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severity to the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh.

(Colossians 3:1) 
Since you are resurrected with Christ, you should seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God:

(Colossians 3:2) 
You should focus on the things above, not the things of the earth.

(Colossians 3:3) 
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

(Colossians 3:4) 
When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.

(Colossians 3:5) 
Therefore, you must put to death the members of your body that are on the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is the worship of idols.

(Colossians 3:6) 
Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon those who do not believe.

(Colossians 3:7) 
In these things, you too once walked, when you lived among them.

(Colossians 3:8) 
But now, you must rid yourselves of all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and foul language from your mouth.

(Colossians 3:9) 
Do not lie to each other, stripping off the old self with its practices,

(Colossians 3:10) 
and putting on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator,

(Colossians 3:11) 
where there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all.

(Colossians 3:12) 
Therefore, as the chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,

(Colossians 3:13) 
bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must forgive.

(Colossians 3:14) 
Above all these things, have love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

(Colossians 3:15) 
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.

(Colossians 3:16) 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

(Colossians 3:17) 
And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

(Colossians 3:18) 
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

(Colossians 3:19) 
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

(Colossians 3:20) 
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.

(Colossians 3:21) 
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, so they do not become discouraged.

(Colossians 3:22) 
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while they are watching, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.

(Colossians 3:23) 
Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

(Colossians 3:24) 
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.

(Colossians 3:25) 
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for his wrongs, and there is no partiality.

(Colossians 4:1) 
Masters, give to your servants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the universe.

(Colossians 4:2) 
Be persistent in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

(Colossians 4:3) 
Pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound),

(Colossians 4:4) 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

(Colossians 4:5) 
Walk with wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.

(Colossians 4:6) 
Let your speech always be in grace, seasoned with salt: so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

(Colossians 4:7) 
All that concerns me, and what I do, Tychicus, the most dear brother, and faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you:

(Colossians 4:8) 
whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts,

(Colossians 4:9) 
with Onesimus, a faithful and most dear brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things that are done here.

(Colossians 4:10) 
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, salutes you; and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you have received commands: if he comes to you, receive him:

(Colossians 4:11) 
and Jesus, who is called Justus: who are of the circumcision. These alone are fellow workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.

(Colossians 4:12) 
Epaphras, who is one of you, the servant of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.

(Colossians 4:13) 
For I bear him witness that he has much labor for you, and for those who are at Laodicea, and for those who are at Hierapolis.

(Colossians 4:14) 
Luke, the most dear physician, salutes you, and Demas.

(Colossians 4:15) 
Salute the brothers who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.

(Colossians 4:16) 
And when this letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that which is [sent] from Laodicea, read that also among yourselves.

(Colossians 4:17) 
And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”

(Colossians 4:18) 
The greeting by the hand of Paul. Be mindful of my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

(1 Thessalonians 1:1) 
From Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy: to the church of the Thessalonians, who are united to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 1:2) 
Grace to you, and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing,

(1 Thessalonians 1:3) 
constantly remembering your work of faith and your labor, and the love and patience of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father:

(1 Thessalonians 1:4) 
Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election:

(1 Thessalonians 1:5) 
Because our Gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, just as you know what kind of men we were among you, for your sakes.

(1 Thessalonians 1:6) 
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word with much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,

(1 Thessalonians 1:7) 
so that you were made a pattern to all those who believe, in Macedonia and in Achaia.

(1 Thessalonians 1:8) 
For from you has gone forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith, which is toward God, has gone forth, so that we need not to speak anything.

(1 Thessalonians 1:9) 
For they themselves relate of us what kind of entrance we had to you: and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,

(1 Thessalonians 1:10) 
and to await His Son from the universe—Jesus—whom He raised from the dead, who has delivered us from the wrath to come.

(1 Thessalonians 2:1) 
You know yourselves, brothers, that we didn’t come to you in vain, wasting time or energy:

(1 Thessalonians 2:2) 
But after suffering and enduring insults, as you know, in Philippi, we had the courage given to us by God to preach to you in difficult times.

(1 Thessalonians 2:3) 
For our encouragement did not come from error, nor from uncleanness, nor from trickery:

(1 Thessalonians 2:4) 
but as we were proven worthy by God, that the Gospel be entrusted to us, so do we speak, not as those pleasing men, but God, who knows our hearts.

(1 Thessalonians 2:5) 
For at no time were we in speech with flattery, as you know: nor with an occasion for greed: God is witness.

(1 Thessalonians 2:6) 
Nor seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others:

(1 Thessalonians 2:7) 
though we could have been a burden to you, in order to seek the glory of Christ:

(1 Thessalonians 2:8) 
but we became little ones among you, as a mother would nurture her children:

(1 Thessalonians 2:9) 
in this way, we longed for you, and eagerly wished to hand over to you not only the Gospel of God, but also our souls: because you have become very dear to us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:10) 
For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: for working night and day, so that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Gospel of God.

(1 Thessalonians 2:11) 
You are witnesses, and God is too: how holy, just, and blameless we were among you who believed:

(1 Thessalonians 2:12) 
as you know, how we exhorted each of you, as a father does his children,

(1 Thessalonians 2:13) 
assuring, consoling, and testifying to you, that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.

(1 Thessalonians 2:14) 
For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing: because when you received from us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as it truly is the word of God, which works in you who believe.

(1 Thessalonians 2:15) 
For you have become imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: because the same things that they suffered were also suffered by you from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,

(1 Thessalonians 2:16) 
who also killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us, and do not please God, and are against all men,

(1 Thessalonians 2:17) 
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, so that they may always fill up their sins: for the wrath of God has come upon them to the end.

(1 Thessalonians 2:18) 
But we, brothers, being left desolate from you for a time, in appearance, not in heart, we eagerly sought all the more to see your face with great desire.

(1 Thessalonians 2:19) 
Because we wanted to come to you, I, indeed, Paul, once and again: and Satan prevented us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:20) 
For who is our hope, or joy, or the crown of glory? Are you not? Before our Lord Jesus at His coming?

(1 Thessalonians 2:21) 
For you are our glory and joy.

(1 Thessalonians 3:1) 
Because of this, we could not bear to remain alone in Athens.

(1 Thessalonians 3:2) 
So we sent our brother Timothy, a servant of God in the Gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and to exhort you in your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:3) 
We sent him so that no one would be shaken by these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.

(1 Thessalonians 3:4) 
For when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we would suffer tribulation, even as it came to pass, and as you know.

(1 Thessalonians 3:5) 
For this cause, I also, not bearing it any longer, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter has tempted you and our labor become vain.

(1 Thessalonians 3:6) 
But now, Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and your charity and that you have a good memory of us always, desiring to see us, just as we also want to see you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:7) 
Therefore, brothers, we have been comforted about you in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:8) 
Because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 3:9) 
For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before God,

(1 Thessalonians 3:10) 
night and day praying more abundantly that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?

(1 Thessalonians 3:11) 
Now God Himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:12) 
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love towards one another and towards all men, even as we do towards you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:13) 
So that he may establish your hearts without blame, in holiness before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(1 Thessalonians 4:1) 
And now, brothers, we beg you and beseech you in the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is our earnest desire that you continue living the holy life that we have taught you, the life that is pleasing to God, and that you do it even more and more.

(1 Thessalonians 4:2) 
For you know very well what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:3) 
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you stay away from all sexual sin,

(1 Thessalonians 4:4) 
that each of you knows how to control his own body in holiness and honor,

(1 Thessalonians 4:5) 
and not in the lust of passion, as the Gentiles who do not know God do:

(1 Thessalonians 4:6) 
that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you and testified before.

(1 Thessalonians 4:7) 
For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.

(1 Thessalonians 4:8) 
Therefore, he who rejects this, rejects not man, but God, who has also given His Holy Spirit to you.

(1 Thessalonians 4:9) 
Now concerning fraternal love, we do not need to write to you. For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.

(1 Thessalonians 4:10) 
For indeed you do this toward all the brothers who are in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to increase more and more,

(1 Thessalonians 4:11) 
and to strive to be at peace, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we have commanded you,

(1 Thessalonians 4:12) 
so that you may walk honestly toward those who are outside, and that you may not lack anything.

(1 Thessalonians 4:13) 
But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve as the others do who have no hope.

(1 Thessalonians 4:14) 
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:15) 
For this we tell you by the word of the Lord: that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.

(1 Thessalonians 4:16) 
For the Lord Himself, with a command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from the sky: and the dead who are in Christ will rise first.

(1 Thessalonians 4:17) 
Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air: and so we will always be with the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 4:18) 
Therefore, comfort one another with these words.

(1 Thessalonians 5:1) 
Now concerning the times and moments, brothers and sisters, there is no need to write to you about it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:2) 
For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:3) 
When they say “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a woman giving birth, and they will not escape.

(1 Thessalonians 5:4) 
But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, that this day should overtake you as a thief.

(1 Thessalonians 5:5) 
For you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night nor of darkness.

(1 Thessalonians 5:6) 
Therefore let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us keep awake and be sober.

(1 Thessalonians 5:7) 
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:8) 
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of the hope of salvation.

(1 Thessalonians 5:9) 
For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Thessalonians 5:10) 
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.

(1 Thessalonians 5:11) 
Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, as indeed you are doing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:12) 
We ask you, brothers and sisters, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

(1 Thessalonians 5:13) 
and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

(1 Thessalonians 5:14) 
And we exhort you, brothers and sisters, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:15) 
See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good, both for yourselves and for all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:16) 
Rejoice always.

(1 Thessalonians 5:17) 
Pray without ceasing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:18) 
In everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 5:19) 
Do not quench the Spirit.

(1 Thessalonians 5:20) 
Do not despise prophecies,

(1 Thessalonians 5:21) 
but test everything; hold fast to what is good.

(1 Thessalonians 5:22) 
Abstain from every form of evil.

(1 Thessalonians 5:23) 
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 5:24) 
He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:25) 
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

(1 Thessalonians 5:26) 
Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

(1 Thessalonians 5:27) 
I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the holy brothers and sisters.

(1 Thessalonians 5:28) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

(2 Thessalonians 1:1) 
From Paul, Silas, and Timothy, to the Church of the Thessalonians, who are in God our Father, and in Our Lord Jesus Christ:

(2 Thessalonians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be given to you from God our Father, and from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 1:3) 
We ought to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is proper, because your faith increases so much, and the charity of each one of you abounds toward one another:

(2 Thessalonians 1:4) 
so that we ourselves may glory in you in the churches of God, because of your patience and faith in all your persecutions, and in the tribulations that you endure,

(2 Thessalonians 1:5) 
This is proof of God’s just judgment, that you may be worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:

(2 Thessalonians 1:6) 
Because it is just for God to repay with tribulation those who afflict you:

(2 Thessalonians 1:7) 
and to give rest to you who are afflicted, along with us, at the revelation of Our Lord Jesus Christ with the angels of His power,

(2 Thessalonians 1:8) 
in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and who do not obey the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ:

(2 Thessalonians 1:9) 
These people will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power:

(2 Thessalonians 1:10) 
On that day, He will come to be glorified among His holy ones, and to be admired among all who have believed (because our testimony among you was believed).

(2 Thessalonians 1:11) 
Therefore, we always pray for you: that God may deem you worthy of His calling, and may fulfill every desire of goodness, and the work of faith in power,

(2 Thessalonians 1:12) 
so that the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God, and Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 2:1) 
Now, brothers, we beg you about the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering to Him.

(2 Thessalonians 2:2) 
Don't let anyone easily shake your faith, nor should you be frightened, whether by a spirit, or by a word, or by a letter as if sent by us, that the Day of the Lord is present.

(2 Thessalonians 2:3) 
Let no one deceive you in any way. Because the Day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy has come first, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, has been revealed,

(2 Thessalonians 2:4) 
Who opposes and elevates himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped. This man will sit in the temple of God, showing himself as if he is God.

(2 Thessalonians 2:5) 
Don't you remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?

(2 Thessalonians 2:6) 
Now you know what restrains him, so that he may be revealed in his time.

(2 Thessalonians 2:7) 
For the mystery of iniquity is already at work, only until he who now restrains is taken out of the way.

(2 Thessalonians 2:8) 
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of His mouth, and will destroy with the brightness of His coming.

(2 Thessalonians 2:9) 
This man's coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and wonders of lies,

(2 Thessalonians 2:10) 
and in all the deceits of wickedness for those who perish, because they didn't accept the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

(2 Thessalonians 2:11) 
And therefore God will send them the operation of error, that they should believe a lie:

(2 Thessalonians 2:12) 
so that all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but who consented to iniquity.

(2 Thessalonians 2:13) 
But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brothers beloved by God, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation, in the sanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth:

(2 Thessalonians 2:14) 
to which He called you through our Gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 2:15) 
So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught, either by word of mouth, or by our letter.

(2 Thessalonians 2:16) 
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God and our Father, who loved us, and gave everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,

(2 Thessalonians 2:17) 
exhort your hearts, and confirm them in every good work and word.

(2 Thessalonians 3:1) 
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord spreads and is glorified, just as it is with you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:2) 
And pray that we might be delivered from unreasonable and evil men. Because not everyone has faith.

(2 Thessalonians 3:3) 
But God is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from evil.

(2 Thessalonians 3:4) 
Moreover, we trust in the Lord concerning you, that you both do the things that we command you, and will do them.

(2 Thessalonians 3:5) 
And may the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and in the patience of Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 3:6) 
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they received from us.

(2 Thessalonians 3:7) 
For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us: because we did not act disorderly among you,

(2 Thessalonians 3:8) 
nor did we eat anyone's bread for free, but we worked in labor and toil night and day, so that we would not burden any of you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:9) 
Not because we did not have the authority, but to give ourselves as a model to you, so that you might imitate us.

(2 Thessalonians 3:10) 
For even when we were with you, we were commanding you this: that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.

(2 Thessalonians 3:11) 
For we hear that some of you are walking disorderly, doing no work, but acting as busybodies.

(2 Thessalonians 3:12) 
Now those of that kind we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly, they eat their own bread.

(2 Thessalonians 3:13) 
But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.

(2 Thessalonians 3:14) 
And if anyone does not obey our word through this letter, note this one, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.

(2 Thessalonians 3:15) 
And do not consider him an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

(2 Thessalonians 3:16) 
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every place. The Lord be with all of you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:17) 
The greeting by my own hand, Paul, which is the sign in every letter; I write in this way.

(2 Thessalonians 3:18) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.

(1 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the command of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope,

(1 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, a beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.

(1 Timothy 1:3) 
As I requested you to stay in Ephesus, on my way to Macedonia, so that you would command certain people not to teach differently,

(1 Timothy 1:4) 
nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which give rise to disputes, rather than to the edification of God, which is in faith.

(1 Timothy 1:5) 
Now the goal of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.

(1 Timothy 1:6) 
From these things some, having strayed, are turned aside to vain speech,

(1 Timothy 1:7) 
desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor the things concerning which they make affirmation.

(1 Timothy 1:8) 
But we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully:

(1 Timothy 1:9) 
knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the impious and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers,

(1 Timothy 1:10) 
fornicators, those who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if there is anything else that goes against sound doctrine;

(1 Timothy 1:11) 
according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was entrusted to me.

(1 Timothy 1:12) 
And I give thanks to him who has strengthened me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, because he has judged me faithful, putting me into the ministry,

(1 Timothy 1:13) 
who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.

(1 Timothy 1:14) 
And the grace of our Lord abounded with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 1:15) 
Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

(1 Timothy 1:16) 
But for this reason I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth all patience, for the example of those who would believe in him unto life everlasting.

(1 Timothy 1:17) 
Now to the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(1 Timothy 1:18) 
This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,

(1 Timothy 1:19) 
holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having thrust aside, have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith.

(1 Timothy 1:20) 
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

(1 Timothy 2:1) 
I ask, then, that, first of all, that there be prayers of supplication, prayers of petition, and thanksgiving offered for all people:

(1 Timothy 2:2) 
Pray for those in authority, and all those who govern, so that we may live a calm and tranquil life, with all piety and chastity.

(1 Timothy 2:3) 
This is good, and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior,

(1 Timothy 2:4) 
Who wills all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

(1 Timothy 2:5) 
For there is only one God, and only one mediator between God and humankind, the man Christ Jesus:

(1 Timothy 2:6) 
Who gave Himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in his own time:

(1 Timothy 2:7) 
I, Paul, have been placed as a herald, and an apostle—I speak the truth and do not lie—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

(1 Timothy 2:8) 
I want, therefore, men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger or quarreling.

(1 Timothy 2:9) 
Likewise, women should adorn themselves in modest apparel, with decency and moderation, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly clothes,

(1 Timothy 2:10) 
but with good works, as befits women who profess godliness.

(1 Timothy 2:11) 
Let a woman learn in silence, with all subjection.

(1 Timothy 2:12) 
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.

(1 Timothy 2:13) 
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

(1 Timothy 2:14) 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

(1 Timothy 2:15) 
But she will be saved through childbirth, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with moderation.

(1 Timothy 3:1) 
This is a true statement: If a man desires to be a bishop, he is reaching for an honorable work.

(1 Timothy 3:2) 
A bishop, therefore, must be above reproach, he must be a one-woman man, sober, prudent, respectable, chaste, hospitable, and able to teach,

(1 Timothy 3:3) 
not a drunkard or a brawler, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy,

(1 Timothy 3:4) 
one who manages his own household well, with his children in submission with all dignity.

(1 Timothy 3:5) 
(For if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)

(1 Timothy 3:6) 
He must not be a recent convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and fall into the devil's judgment.

(1 Timothy 3:7) 
Moreover, he must have a good reputation with those outside the Church, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil's snare.

(1 Timothy 3:8) 
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for sordid gain.

(1 Timothy 3:9) 
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.

(1 Timothy 3:10) 
Let these also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.

(1 Timothy 3:11) 
Women, in like manner, must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober and trustworthy in everything.

(1 Timothy 3:12) 
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, and let them manage their children and their own households well.

(1 Timothy 3:13) 
For those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 3:14) 
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon,

(1 Timothy 3:15) 
but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.

(1 Timothy 3:16) 
And without doubt, the mystery of godliness is great: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

(1 Timothy 4:1) 
The Spirit clearly says that in the final days, some will abandon the faith, listening to the spirits of error and the teachings of demons.

(1 Timothy 4:2) 
They will be deceivers, and their consciences will be seared.

(1 Timothy 4:3) 
They will forbid marriage and tell people to abstain from certain foods. God created these foods to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

(1 Timothy 4:4) 
Everything God made is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving:

(1 Timothy 4:5) 
It is made holy by the word of God and prayer.

(1 Timothy 4:6) 
By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of the faith and the good teaching that you have followed.

(1 Timothy 4:7) 
But reject profane and old wives' tales, and train yourself to be a man of faith.

(1 Timothy 4:8) 
Physical training has some value, but faith is valuable in every way. It promises life now and in the future.

(1 Timothy 4:9) 
This is a faithful saying, worthy of all acceptance.

(1 Timothy 4:10) 
We work hard and suffer insults for this, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

(1 Timothy 4:11) 
Command and teach these things.

(1 Timothy 4:12) 
Let no one look down on your youth. Instead, be an example for the believers in your speech, in your conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.

(1 Timothy 4:13) 
Until I come, focus on reading the Scriptures, exhorting others, and teaching.

(1 Timothy 4:14) 
Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.

(1 Timothy 4:15) 
Meditate on these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.

(1 Timothy 4:16) 
Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in them, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

(1 Timothy 5:1) 
Never scold an older man, but instead implore him as if he were your own father. Treat younger men as brothers.

(1 Timothy 5:2) 
Treat older women as mothers. Treat younger women as sisters—in all purity.

(1 Timothy 5:3) 
Give honor to widows who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:4) 
If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to manage their own household and to repay their parents and grandparents; for this is acceptable before God.

(1 Timothy 5:5) 
Now, she who is truly a widow, and desolate, hopes in God, and persists in prayers night and day.

(1 Timothy 5:6) 
But she who is self-indulgent is dead while she lives.

(1 Timothy 5:7) 
Give these instructions, so that they may be blameless.

(1 Timothy 5:8) 
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

(1 Timothy 5:9) 
Let a widow be chosen if she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband,

(1 Timothy 5:10) 
having a testimony of good works: if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.

(1 Timothy 5:11) 
But refuse younger widows. For when they have grown luxurious against Christ, they want to marry,

(1 Timothy 5:12) 
having condemnation, because they have set aside their first faith.

(1 Timothy 5:13) 
At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things which they ought not.

(1 Timothy 5:14) 
Therefore, I want younger women to marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity for reproach.

(1 Timothy 5:15) 
For some have already turned aside after Satan.

(1 Timothy 5:16) 
If any believing man or woman has widows, let them provide for them, and let not the Church be burdened, so that it may suffice for those who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:17) 
Let the presbyters who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in doctrine.

(1 Timothy 5:18) 
For the Scripture says: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”

(1 Timothy 5:19) 
Do not receive an accusation against a presbyter, except under two or three witnesses.

(1 Timothy 5:20) 
Those who sin, rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.

(1 Timothy 5:21) 
I solemnly charge you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality.

(1 Timothy 5:22) 
Lay hands on no one hastily, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself chaste.

(1 Timothy 5:23) 
No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach, and your frequent infirmities.

(1 Timothy 5:24) 
The sins of some men are evident, preceding them to judgment, while the sins of others follow them.

(1 Timothy 5:25) 
Likewise, the good works are evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

(1 Timothy 6:1) 
Those who are slaves must consider their masters worthy of all honor. This is to prevent the name of God and His teaching from being dishonored.

(1 Timothy 6:2) 
Those who have faithful masters shouldn't despise them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve even more diligently, because those masters are faithful and beloved and share in the benefit of Christ. Teach these things, and urge them upon others.

(1 Timothy 6:3) 
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not adhere to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching that accords with true devotion,

(1 Timothy 6:4) 
he is conceited and knows nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and quarrels about words. These disputes produce envy, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,

(1 Timothy 6:5) 
and the wrangling of people who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Stay away from such people.

(1 Timothy 6:6) 
But godliness with contentment is great gain.

(1 Timothy 6:7) 
For we brought nothing into this world, and we cannot take anything out of it.

(1 Timothy 6:8) 
But if we have food and clothing, with these things we should be content.

(1 Timothy 6:9) 
Those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

(1 Timothy 6:10) 
For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some, yearning for, have gone astray from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

(1 Timothy 6:11) 
But you, man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

(1 Timothy 6:12) 
Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called and made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.

(1 Timothy 6:13) 
I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate,

(1 Timothy 6:14) 
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Timothy 6:15) 
which He will manifest at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

(1 Timothy 6:16) 
who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

(1 Timothy 6:17) 
Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.

(1 Timothy 6:18) 
Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,

(1 Timothy 6:19) 
storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.

(1 Timothy 6:20) 
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge.

(1 Timothy 6:21) 
By professing such knowledge, some have gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.

(2 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of eternal life, which is in Christ Jesus,

(2 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, my dearest son: grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

(2 Timothy 1:3) 
I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did. I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day,

(2 Timothy 1:4) 
longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,

(2 Timothy 1:5) 
I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it lives in you as well.

(2 Timothy 1:6) 
For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

(2 Timothy 1:7) 
For God gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control.

(2 Timothy 1:8) 
So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share in suffering for the Gospel according to the power of God,

(2 Timothy 1:9) 
who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of His own purpose and grace, which He gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

(2 Timothy 1:10) 
and which now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel,

(2 Timothy 1:11) 
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.

(2 Timothy 1:12) 
That is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.

(2 Timothy 1:13) 
Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 1:14) 
Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.

(2 Timothy 1:15) 
You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

(2 Timothy 1:16) 
May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,

(2 Timothy 1:17) 
but when he arrived in Rome, he searched for me even more eagerly until he found me.

(2 Timothy 1:18) 
May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well how many ways he served me in Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:1) 
Therefore, my son, strengthen yourself by relying on the grace that is only found in Jesus Christ.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:2) 
The truths you have heard from me, which were confirmed by many witnesses, entrust these teachings to faithful and trustworthy men who will also be capable of teaching these same truths to others.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:3) 
Work hard and endure difficulty, just like a good soldier of Christ Jesus must.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:4) 
No one who is serving as a soldier allows himself to be entangled in worldly affairs, because his main goal is to please the one who enlisted him.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:5) 
Similarly, if someone competes in an athletic contest, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the established rules.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:6) 
The hardworking farmer is the one who should be the first to receive a share of the harvest.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:7) 
Consider carefully what I am saying, because the Lord will grant you understanding in all these matters.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:8) 
Always remember that Jesus Christ Our Lord, a descendant of David, was raised from the dead. This is the central truth of the Gospel I preach.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:9) 
Because of this Gospel, I suffer hardship and am even imprisoned, as if I were a criminal. But the Word of God, which is Jesus Christ and His teachings, cannot be imprisoned.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:10) 
Because of this, I endure all these things for the sake of God's elect, so that they, too, may obtain the eternal salvation that is found in Jesus Christ, along with the glory of heaven.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:11) 
This is a trustworthy saying: If we have died with Him through baptism and penance, we will also live with Him in eternal life.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:12) 
If we persevere in suffering for Him, we will also reign with Him. But if we deny Him, He will also deny us on the day of judgment.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:13) 
Even if we are faithless, He remains faithful to His promises, for He cannot deny His own divine nature.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:14) 
Remind everyone of these truths, solemnly testifying before the Lord. Warn them not to engage in useless arguments about words, for such debates are good for nothing except leading those who listen to spiritual ruin.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:15) 
Strive diligently to present yourself to God as a worker who is approved and has no need to be ashamed, because you are accurately handling the Word of Truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:16) 
However, avoid profane and empty talk and innovative theories, for these only lead people further into ungodliness.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:17) 
Their teachings will spread like gangrene, and among these false teachers are Hymenæus and Philetus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:18) 
These men have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and in doing so, they have undermined the faith of certain individuals.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:19) 
Nevertheless, the unshakeable foundation of God stands firm, sealed with this double inscription: 'The Lord knows those who are His,' and 'Everyone who invokes the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.'

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:20) 
In a large household, there are not only vessels made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some of these are used for honorable purposes, while others are for common or dishonorable use.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:21) 
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from such false teachings and corrupt practices, he will become a vessel set apart for honorable use, sanctified, useful to the Lord, and ready for every good work.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:22) 
Flee from youthful desires, and instead, earnestly pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, doing so with all those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:23) 
But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing full well that they only lead to quarrels.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:24) 
A servant of the Lord must not quarrel; instead, he must be gentle towards everyone, capable of teaching, and patient when wronged.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:25) 
He must humbly correct those who oppose the truth, in the hope that God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:26) 
In this way, they might escape from the devil’s snare, having been captured by him to do his will.

(2 Timothy 3:1) 
But understand this truth: in the final days of history, perilous times will be upon us.

(2 Timothy 3:2) 
For at that time, people will be consumed with love for themselves, obsessed with money, filled with pride and arrogance, blasphemers, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful for blessings, and entirely unholy.

(2 Timothy 3:3) 
They will lack natural affection, be unforgiving, eager to accuse falsely, without self-control, brutal, and without any love for what is good.

(2 Timothy 3:4) 
They will be betrayers, recklessly defiant, puffed up with self-importance, and will love worldly pleasures more than they love God.

(2 Timothy 3:5) 
They will maintain an outward appearance of piety, but they will deny the true power and virtue of it in their lives. You must turn away from such people.

(2 Timothy 3:6) 
For among these sorts of people are those who slyly infiltrate private homes, leading astray impressionable women who are burdened by their sins and easily swayed by various worldly desires.

(2 Timothy 3:7) 
These women are always learning, yet they never come to a full and certain knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 3:8) 
Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses with their magic, so do these false teachers resist the divine truth. They are men with corrupted minds, whose faith has been rejected and found wanting.

(2 Timothy 3:9) 
But they will not make any further progress, because their foolishness will become obvious to everyone, just as the foolishness of Jannes and Jambres was made manifest.

(2 Timothy 3:10) 
But you, Timothy, have thoroughly observed and followed my teaching, my manner of life, my true purpose, my faith, my patience with others, my love for all, and my perseverance through suffering.

(2 Timothy 3:11) 
You have also seen my persecutions and sufferings—what I went through in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what intense persecutions I endured, yet out of all of them, the Lord truly delivered me.

(2 Timothy 3:12) 
In fact, everyone who truly desires to live a life of piety united with Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

(2 Timothy 3:13) 
But wicked people and deceivers will only continue to grow worse, always going astray themselves and leading others into error.

(2 Timothy 3:14) 
But you, Timothy, must continue steadfastly in the truths you have learned and which have been entrusted to you, knowing the trustworthy teachers from whom you received them.

(2 Timothy 3:15) 
And know that from your very childhood, you have been familiar with the sacred Scriptures, which possess the power to instruct you unto salvation, through the active faith that you have in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 3:16) 
All of Sacred Scripture is inspired by God's own breath; therefore, it is profitable for teaching sound doctrine, for convicting the conscience, for correcting sinful behavior, and for training in all righteousness.

(2 Timothy 3:17) 
This is so that the man consecrated to God may be fully complete and perfectly equipped for every good work.

(2 Timothy 4:1) 
I solemnly charge you before God the Father, and Christ Jesus, who will judge both the living and the dead by His Second Coming and His Eternal Reign.

(2 Timothy 4:2) 
Preach the true word of God. Be ready and urgent in season and out of season. Correct those who err, entreat the wavering, and rebuke the obstinate, doing all of this with great patience and careful teaching.

(2 Timothy 4:3) 
For there will come a time when people will no longer tolerate sound doctrine. Instead, they will gather teachers for themselves who cater to their own desires, because they have itching ears, desiring only what they want to hear.

(2 Timothy 4:4) 
They will turn away from truly hearing the truth, and will instead turn to fables and myths.

(2 Timothy 4:5) 
But you, for your part, stay watchful in all things. Endure hardships. Perform the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry completely.

(2 Timothy 4:6) 
For I am already being poured out like a libation in sacrifice, and the time for my departure from this life is at hand.

(2 Timothy 4:7) 
I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the Catholic Faith.

(2 Timothy 4:8) 
From now on, the crown of justice is reserved for me, which the Lord, the just Judge, will give to me on that Day of Judgment. This crown is not for me alone, but also for all those who love His coming.

(2 Timothy 4:9) 
Make every effort to come to me quickly.

(2 Timothy 4:10) 
For Demas has abandoned me because he loved this present world, and he has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

(2 Timothy 4:11) 
Luke is the only one with me now. Take Mark with you and bring him along, for he is very useful to me in ministry.

(2 Timothy 4:12) 
However, I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 4:13) 
When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas. Also bring the books, and especially the parchments.

(2 Timothy 4:14) 
Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me great harm. May the Lord repay him according to his deeds.

(2 Timothy 4:15) 
You also must avoid him, for he strongly opposed our message.

(2 Timothy 4:16) 
At my first defense in court, no one stood with me, but everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.

(2 Timothy 4:17) 
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching of the Gospel might be fully accomplished, and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the mouth of the lion.

(2 Timothy 4:18) 
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(2 Timothy 4:19) 
Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.

(2 Timothy 4:20) 
Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

(2 Timothy 4:21) 
Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.

(2 Timothy 4:22) 
May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May grace be with you all. Amen.

(Titus 1:1:1) 
Paul, a servant of God, and moreover an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith that God chose for His people, and according to the knowledge of the truth that leads to genuine godliness.

(Titus 1:1:2) 
This is all for the hope of eternal life, which God—He who cannot lie—promised even before the ages of time began.

(Titus 1:1:3) 
But at the proper time, God revealed His Word through the preaching that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:4) 
To Titus, my beloved son in our common faith: May grace and peace be with you from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:5) 
For this very purpose I left you behind in Crete: to set right what was still unfinished and to appoint priests—who are spiritual leaders—in every city, just as I instructed you.

(Titus 1:1:6) 
For a priest must be a man without blemish, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who are not accused of wild living or being disobedient.

(Titus 1:1:7) 
For a bishop—as God’s steward—must be without blemish; he must not be arrogant, not quick-tempered, not prone to much wine, not violent, and not greedy for dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:8) 
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, and self-controlled.

(Titus 1:1:9) 
He must hold fast to the faithful teaching that is in line with true doctrine, so that he may be able to encourage others with sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it.

(Titus 1:1:10) 
For there are many disobedient people, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially those who insist on circumcision.

(Titus 1:1:11) 
It is necessary to silence them, for they are overthrowing entire households by teaching things they ought not to, all for the sake of dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:12) 
One of their own, a prophet from among them, once said: 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.'

(Titus 1:1:13) 
This testimony is true. For this reason, you must rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith.

(Titus 1:1:14) 
They must no longer pay attention to Jewish fables and to the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

(Titus 1:1:15) 
To those who are pure, everything is pure. But to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, for both their mind and conscience are defiled.

(Titus 1:1:16) 
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:1) 
But you, Titus, must teach what is appropriate for sound, holy doctrine.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:2) 
Tell the older men to be sober, prudent, self-controlled, and sound in their faith, in their charity for others, and in their patience.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:3) 
Likewise, tell the older women to conduct themselves in a holy manner. They must not be slanderers, nor should they be enslaved to much wine, but rather they should be good teachers of what is right.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:4) 
This way, they can teach the younger women to be prudent and to love their husbands and their children,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:5) 
to be discreet, chaste, self-controlled, managing their households well, kind, and submissive to their own husbands. This way, the word of God will not be blasphemed or spoken ill of.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:6) 
Likewise, encourage the younger men to be self-controlled in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:7) 
In everything, you yourself, Titus, must set an example of good works for them. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, and seriousness,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:8) 
and let your message be sound and beyond reproach. This way, any opponent will be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us Christians.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:9) 
Tell servants to be submissive to their own masters in everything. They should be pleasing to them, not talking back,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:10) 
not stealing, but rather demonstrating complete trustworthiness in everything, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:11) 
For the grace of God, our Savior, has appeared to all mankind,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:12) 
training us, the faithful, to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires. The grace of God teaches us to live soberly, justly, and piously in this present age,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:13) 
while we await the blessed hope: the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:14) 
He gave Himself for us, in order that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do good works.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:15) 
Say these things, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:1) 
Remind them to submit to the governmental rulers and the authorities, to always obey what is commanded by law, and to be ready and willing for every good work.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:2) 
Remind them not to speak evil of anyone, not to be quarrelsome but to be gentle, always showing perfect humility and kindness to all people.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:3) 
For at one time, we ourselves were also foolish and without understanding, disobedient to God's law, deceived by sin, enslaved to many kinds of earthly desires and corrupt pleasures, living lives full of malice and envy, hateful to others, and always hating one another.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:4) 
But then, the goodness of God and the loving kindness of our Divine Savior, Our Lord Jesus Christ, was fully revealed to us.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:5) 
He saved us, not because of any righteous deeds that we ourselves had done, but solely according to His own great mercy. He saved us through the life-giving washing of Baptism, which is the renewal and rebirth given by the Holy Spirit.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:6) 
God poured out this same Holy Spirit on us in abundance, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:7) 
This was so that, having been justified and made righteous by His grace and favor, we might become true heirs to His promises, holding the certain hope of eternal life.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:8) 
This is a most trustworthy saying. And concerning these things, I want you to teach and insist constantly, so that those who truly believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. These are indeed good and truly profitable things for all mankind.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:9) 
But avoid foolish questions and pointless debates, and endless genealogies, and quarrels and legal disputes over the Law; for these things are useless and completely worthless.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:10) 
As for a man who promotes heresy and division within the Church, after you have warned him once and then a second time, have nothing more to do with him or his teachings.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:11) 
You should know that a person like this is thoroughly corrupted and is actively sinning, because he stands condemned by his own self-chosen judgment and his rejection of the truth.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:12) 
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis as quickly as possible, for I have made plans to spend the winter there.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:13) 
Diligently help Zenas, who is an expert in the Law, and Apollos on their journey, making sure that they lack nothing they might need.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:14) 
And let our Christian people also learn to devote themselves to doing good works, especially for urgent and necessary needs, so that they will not be unproductive or useless in their faith.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:15) 
Everyone who is with me here sends their greetings to you. Greet all those who love us because of our shared faith in Christ. May the grace and divine favor of God be with all of you always. Amen.

(Philemon 1:1) 
Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother in faith, to Philemon, our beloved coworker,

(Philemon 1:2) 
and to Apphia, our sister in faith, to Archippus, our fellow soldier for Christ, and to the Church that meets in your home.

(Philemon 1:3) 
Grace and peace be with you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philemon 1:4) 
I always thank my God and remember you in my prayers,

(Philemon 1:5) 
because I hear about your love and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus Christ, and how you show it to all the holy people in the Church.

(Philemon 1:6) 
I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through your recognition of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:7) 
For I have received great joy and comfort from your love, because you have refreshed the hearts and lives of the holy people, my brother.

(Philemon 1:8) 
Therefore, although I have much confidence in Christ to command you to do what is proper,

(Philemon 1:9) 
I rather appeal to you because of love. I, Paul, am an old man now, and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:10) 
I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus, whom I have fathered spiritually while I have been in prison.

(Philemon 1:11) 
He was once useless to you, but now he is useful to both you and me.

(Philemon 1:12) 
I am sending him back to you. Please receive him, that is to say, receive my very heart and soul.

(Philemon 1:13) 
I truly wanted to keep him with me, so that he could serve me on your behalf while I am in prison for the Gospel.

(Philemon 1:14) 
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but rather a voluntary act of your free will.

(Philemon 1:15) 
For perhaps he departed from you for a short time for this very reason: that you might have him back forever,

(Philemon 1:16) 
no longer as a slave, but as a beloved brother—far more than a slave. He is especially beloved to me, and how much more so to you, both physically (in the flesh) and spiritually (in the Lord)?

(Philemon 1:17) 
So if you consider me a partner in the faith, welcome him as you would welcome me.

(Philemon 1:18) 
If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge it to my account.

(Philemon 1:19) 
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay you. I do not need to mention that you owe me even your very self.

(Philemon 1:20) 
Yes, my brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart and soul in Christ.

(Philemon 1:21) 
I write to you confident in your obedience, knowing that you will do even more than what I am asking.

(Philemon 1:22) 
Also, at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

(Philemon 1:23) 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings.

(Philemon 1:24) 
Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers, also greet you.

(Philemon 1:25) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

(Hebrews 1:1) 
In many and various ways, God spoke in times past to our fathers through the Prophets.

(Hebrews 1:2) 
But in these last days, He has spoken to us through the Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He also created the ages and the universe.

(Hebrews 1:3) 
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory, and the exact representation of His very being. He sustains all things by His powerful Word. After He had made purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Divine Majesty on high.

(Hebrews 1:4) 
He became so much superior to the angels, just as the Name He inherited is more excellent than theirs.

(Hebrews 1:5) 
For to which of the angels did God ever say: 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You'? And again: 'I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to Me'?

(Hebrews 1:6) 
And when God again introduces the Firstborn into the world, He says: 'And let all the angels of God worship Him'.

(Hebrews 1:7) 
And concerning the angels, indeed, He says: 'Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire'.

(Hebrews 1:8) 
But to the Son He says: 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. Your rule is perfectly just'.

(Hebrews 1:9) 
You have loved justice and hated iniquity. Therefore, God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

(Hebrews 1:10) 
And: 'You, O Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the universe is the work of Your hands'.

(Hebrews 1:11) 
They will perish, but You remain. And they will all grow old like a garment.

(Hebrews 1:12) 
Like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not come to an end.

(Hebrews 1:13) 
But to which of the angels has God ever said: 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet'?

(Hebrews 1:14) 
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth on a mission to serve on behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?

(Hebrews 2:1) 
Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to the truths we have heard, so that we do not drift away from God’s truth.

(Hebrews 2:2) 
For if the Old Law, which was spoken to us through angels, was established as true and firm, and every transgression and act of disobedience to that Law received a just and deserved punishment,

(Hebrews 2:3) 
how shall we escape God’s judgment if we neglect this great salvation? This salvation was first announced directly by the Lord Himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who personally heard Him speak.

(Hebrews 2:4) 
God also bore witness to this salvation through signs, wonders, and various powerful miracles, along with distributions of the Holy Spirit’s gifts, all according to His own divine will.

(Hebrews 2:5) 
For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, the new order of creation that we are now speaking about.

(Hebrews 2:6) 
However, someone once testified in Scripture, saying: 'What is man, that You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him?'

(Hebrews 2:7) 
You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor, and You appointed him over all the works of Your hands.

(Hebrews 2:8) 
You put all things under his feet.' Indeed, by subjecting all things to him, God left nothing that is not subject to man. However, right now, we do not yet see all things fully subjected to man in the world.

(Hebrews 2:9) 
But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels—we see Him crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of His death. He suffered death for every single person, so that through this experience, He might be made fully suitable and perfect to be our merciful High Priest.

(Hebrews 2:10) 
For it was entirely fitting that God the Father—for Whom and through Whom all things exist—in bringing many sons and daughters into His glory, would make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.

(Hebrews 2:11) 
For both He who makes holy (Jesus Christ) and those who are made holy (the faithful) are all from one Father. For this reason, Christ is not ashamed to call them His brothers and sisters, saying:

(Hebrews 2:12) 
'I will proclaim Your Name to My brothers and sisters. In the midst of the assembled Church, I will sing Your praises.'

(Hebrews 2:13) 
And again He says, 'I will put My trust completely in Him.' And again, 'Here I am, with the children God has given Me.'

(Hebrews 2:14) 
Since these children of God share a common human nature of flesh and blood, Jesus Himself likewise fully partook in that very same nature. He did this so that through His own death, He might destroy the one who holds the dominion of death, which is the devil,

(Hebrews 2:15) 
and so that He might free all those who, throughout their entire lives, were held in bondage by the constant fear of death.

(Hebrews 2:16) 
For He certainly did not come to the aid of angels, nor did He take on their nature; rather, He took on the nature of humanity, specifically, the descendants of Abraham.

(Hebrews 2:17) 
Therefore, it was necessary for Him to be made like His brothers and sisters in every single way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in service to God. Through this, He would make atonement and propitiation for the sins of His people.

(Hebrews 2:18) 
For because He Himself suffered and was tempted, He is now powerfully able to come to the aid of those who are also being tempted.

(Hebrews 3:1) 
Therefore, my holy brothers and sisters, you who share in a heavenly calling, focus your attention on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our faith.

(Hebrews 3:2) 
He is faithful to God, who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all of God's own household.

(Hebrews 3:3) 
For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.

(Hebrews 3:4) 
For every house is built by someone, but the One who built all things is God.

(Hebrews 3:5) 
And Moses was certainly faithful in all of God's household as a servant, testifying to the things that would be revealed later.

(Hebrews 3:6) 
But Christ is faithful as a Son presiding over His own household. We are that household, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the glorious boast of our hope until the very end.

(Hebrews 3:7) 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: 'Today, if you hear His voice,

(Hebrews 3:8) 
do not harden your hearts, just as during the provocation on the day of testing in the wilderness,

(Hebrews 3:9) 
where your ancestors tested My patience and proved My power, even though they saw My works for forty years.

(Hebrews 3:10) 
That is why I was greatly provoked with that generation, and I declared: 'These people always go astray in their hearts. Indeed, they have not known My ways,' 

(Hebrews 3:11) 
just as I swore in My anger, 'They shall never enter into My rest.''

(Hebrews 3:12) 
Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you should ever have an evil, unbelieving heart that would lead you to fall away from the living God.

(Hebrews 3:13) 
Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is still called 'Today,' so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

(Hebrews 3:14) 
For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold firmly to the very foundation of our confidence in Him until the end.

(Hebrews 3:15) 
As it is said, 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts just as in that ancient provocation.'

(Hebrews 3:16) 
For some, when they heard God's voice, rebelled against Him. However, not everyone who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses rebelled.

(Hebrews 3:17) 
And with whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies lay dead and scattered in the wilderness?

(Hebrews 3:18) 
And to whom did God swear that they would not enter into His rest, if not to those who were unbelieving?

(Hebrews 3:19) 
So we see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:1) 
Therefore, let us be seriously concerned and afraid that, even though the promise of entering into God's eternal rest is still available, some among you may be considered to have failed to enter it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:2) 
For indeed, the Good News was preached to us, just as it was to that earlier generation in the desert. But the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in the hearts of those who heard it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:3) 
For we who have believed are truly entering into God's rest, just as God said concerning the disobedient generation of Israel: 'As I swore in My wrath, they shall certainly not enter into My rest.' And yet, God's works, the finished creation of the universe and the earth, were completed from the very moment the world was founded, meaning the rest was always prepared.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:4) 
For God spoke in a specific passage concerning the seventh day, saying exactly this: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:5) 
And again, in that same passage, God emphasizes the condition: 'They shall certainly not enter into My rest.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:6) 
Since, therefore, it still remains for some people to enter into that eternal rest, and since those to whom the Good News was first proclaimed did not enter because of their deep-seated unbelief and disobedience,

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:7) 
God again defines a specific time for entry, emphasizing it as 'Today,' speaking through the Psalms of David after such a long period of time. Just as it was said earlier: 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:8) 
For if Joshua, who led the Israelites, had given them the *true* rest—the ultimate and perfect rest God intended—God would never have spoken of another 'today' or another time of rest after that.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:9) 
Therefore, a true and spiritual Sabbath rest, a participation in God's eternal peace and completion, remains for the people of God.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:10) 
For whoever has entered into God's rest has also ceased from his own works and efforts to earn salvation, just as God ceased from His works of creation after they were finished.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:11) 
Let us therefore make every effort and hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same example of stubborn unbelief and disobedience shown by the ancient Israelites.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:12) 
For the Word of God is alive and actively working. It is more piercing and decisive than any two-edged sword, and it reaches even to the deepest separation of soul and spirit, even to the joints and the marrow, fully discerning and judging the hidden thoughts and true intentions of the human heart.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:13) 
And there is no creature, no part of creation, that is invisible or hidden from His sight. Indeed, all things are laid bare and are completely open before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:14) 
Therefore, since we have such a great High Priest who has passed through the created cosmos and ascended into the presence of God Himself—Jesus, the Son of God—let us hold firmly to our confession of faith in Him.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:15) 
For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize with our human weaknesses and sufferings. Rather, we have One who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without committing any sin.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:16) 
Therefore, let us approach with bold confidence to the throne of God's grace, so that we may receive His divine mercy and find His grace to help us precisely when it is most needed.

(Hebrews 5:1) 
Every high priest, taken from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of humanity in matters that pertain to God. His role is to offer up gifts and make sacrifices to atone for sins.

(Hebrews 5:2) 
Because he himself is subject to human weakness, he is able to feel compassion for those who act ignorantly and who make mistakes.

(Hebrews 5:3) 
And because of this weakness, he must offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 5:4) 
And no one presumes to take this high priestly honor upon himself, but only he who is called by God to do so, just as Aaron was.

(Hebrews 5:5) 
In the same way, God the Son did not appoint Himself to be the High Priest, nor did He glorify Himself in this role. Rather, it was God the Father who spoke to Him, declaring: 'You are My Son, and today I have begotten You.'

(Hebrews 5:6) 
Just as He also says in another passage: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 5:7) 
During His time on Earth as a man, God the Son offered up prayers and urgent appeals, with fervent cries and tears, to God the Father, who had the power to save Him from the finality of death. And He was heard and received in His reverence and devotion.

(Hebrews 5:8) 
And although He was already the Son of God, He learned the full meaning and depth of obedience through the sufferings He endured.

(Hebrews 5:9) 
And being made perfect in His human nature through these sufferings, He became the ultimate source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.

(Hebrews 5:10) 
Thus, He was appointed by God to be a High Priest, in the same sacred line and according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 5:11) 
Concerning this, we have much to say, but it is difficult for us to explain it to you, because you have become spiritually slow and dull of hearing.

(Hebrews 5:12) 
For even though by now, given the time that has passed, you ought to be teaching others, instead you still need someone to teach you again the basic, foundational truths of God's teachings. You have become like infants who require milk, not solid spiritual nourishment.

(Hebrews 5:13) 
For everyone who continues to subsist on milk alone is inexperienced in the deeper teachings of righteousness, because he is still a spiritual child.

(Hebrews 5:14) 
But solid spiritual food is meant for those who are mature and have achieved spiritual perfection. These are the ones who, through consistent practice and experience, have trained their spiritual faculties to discern between what is truly good and what is evil.

(Hebrews 6:6:1) 
Therefore, let us leave behind the basic, initial teachings about Christ. We should move on to a more complete and mature understanding, not laying again the foundation of repentance from spiritually dead works and foundational faith in God,

(Hebrews 6:6:2) 
This foundation includes teachings about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the final eternal judgment.

(Hebrews 6:6:3) 
And we will do this—that is, move on to maturity—if God permits us.

(Hebrews 6:6:4) 
Indeed, it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift of divine grace, and who became sharers in the Holy Spirit,

(Hebrews 6:6:5) 
and who tasted the goodness of God's revealed doctrine, and experienced the miraculous powers of the age to come—

(Hebrews 6:6:6) 
if they then fell away from the faith. It is impossible to renew them again for repentance, because by their actions, they crucify the Son of God again for themselves and hold Him up to public shame.

(Hebrews 6:6:7) 
For the land that drinks in the rain that often falls upon it, and then produces useful vegetation for those who cultivate it, receives a blessing from God.

(Hebrews 6:6:8) 
But the land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and is near to being cursed. Its ultimate end is to be burned.

(Hebrews 6:6:9) 
But concerning you, beloved ones, we are confident of better things—things that lead to salvation—even though we speak this way with warnings.

(Hebrews 6:6:10) 
For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have shown for His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and continue to minister to them.

(Hebrews 6:6:11) 
But we earnestly desire that each one of you show the same diligence and care, so that your hope may be fully realized right up to the very end.

(Hebrews 6:6:12) 
This is so that you do not become sluggish, but rather become imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises of God.

(Hebrews 6:6:13) 
For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater by whom to swear, He swore by Himself,

(Hebrews 6:6:14) 
saying, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your descendants."

(Hebrews 6:6:15) 
And so, by patiently enduring, Abraham received the promise.

(Hebrews 6:6:16) 
For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath serves as the final confirmation for all their disputes, settling the matter.

(Hebrews 6:6:17) 
In the same way, God, desiring to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath.

(Hebrews 6:6:18) 
This was so that by two unchangeable things—namely, His promise and His oath—in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have a very strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.

(Hebrews 6:6:19) 
This hope we have as a sure and steadfast anchor for our soul, which penetrates beyond the veil into the Most Holy Place,

(Hebrews 6:6:20) 
where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:1) 
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and a priest of the Most High God, was the one who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.

(Hebrews 7:7:2) 
Abraham then gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name, 'Melchizedek,' is interpreted as 'King of Righteousness.' And then, his title, 'King of Salem,' means 'King of Peace.'

(Hebrews 7:7:3) 
He is recorded as having no father, no mother, and no earthly genealogy. He has no recorded beginning of days, nor any end of life. He is thus likened to the Son of God, and in this way, he remains a priest forever.

(Hebrews 7:7:4) 
Now, consider how great this man was, for Abraham, who was himself the great patriarch, gave this Melchizedek a tenth of all the choicest spoils he had taken in battle.

(Hebrews 7:7:5) 
And truly, those priests who are descended from Levi's sons have a divine command to collect a tenth of all property from the people, according to the Law given by God. This means they collect from their own brethren, the other Israelites, even though these brethren also descended from Abraham's lineage.

(Hebrews 7:7:6) 
But Melchizedek, whose genealogy is not counted among the Levites, received tithes from Abraham. And this priest, who had the divine promises bestowed upon him, then blessed Abraham.

(Hebrews 7:7:7) 
Now, it is beyond any dispute and universally acknowledged that the person who is of a lesser status is always blessed by the person who is of a greater status.

(Hebrews 7:7:8) 
In the case of the Levitical priesthood, tithes are collected by mere mortal men, who are destined to die. But in the case of Melchizedek, the Scripture attests that he lives, and his priesthood has no end.

(Hebrews 7:7:9) 
And it could even be said, in a symbolic sense, that through Abraham, even Levi—who later became the ancestor of the very priests who collect tithes—was himself tithed by Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:10) 
For Levi was still present in the loins of his ancestor, Abraham, when Melchizedek met Abraham and received the tithes.

(Hebrews 7:7:11) 
Therefore, if spiritual perfection could have been achieved through the Levitical priesthood, what further need was there for God to raise up another priest, one described as being 'according to the order of Melchizedek'? And why would he not be called 'according to the order of Aaron'?

(Hebrews 7:7:12) 
For when there is a change in the established priesthood, it is necessary that a change in the entire Law also takes place.

(Hebrews 7:7:13) 
For the one about whom these things are said, that is, Christ, belongs to a completely different tribe of Israel, one from which no one has ever served as a priest at the altar of God.

(Hebrews 7:7:14) 
For it is perfectly clear and well-known that our Lord Jesus Christ was born from the tribe of Judah, and regarding this tribe, Moses said nothing at all concerning their right to have priests.

(Hebrews 7:7:15) 
And it becomes even more abundantly clear that this new priesthood is necessary if another priest arises, one who is specifically 'according to the likeness of Melchizedek'.

(Hebrews 7:7:16) 
This new priest has become such, not by virtue of a merely human, fleshly law, like the Levitical priests, but by the indestructible power of an unending life.

(Hebrews 7:7:17) 
For indeed, the Scripture bears witness, saying to the Son of God: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 7:7:18) 
Thus, the former commandment, which established the Levitical priesthood, is set aside and invalidated. This is done because that old commandment was weak and ultimately useless to bring about salvation.

(Hebrews 7:7:19) 
For the Law, in itself, could not make anyone perfectly righteous or fully reconcile them with God. But now, through the New Covenant, we have been given the introduction of a far better hope, and by this hope, we are able to draw near to God with confidence.

(Hebrews 7:7:20) 
This new High Priesthood was not established without a solemn oath from God Himself.

(Hebrews 7:7:21) 
For the Levitical priests were made priests without any oath from God, but our High Priest, Christ, was made priest with an oath directly from God, as God Himself declared to Him: 'The Lord has sworn an unbreakable oath and will not change His mind: "You are a priest forever."'

(Hebrews 7:7:22) 
By virtue of this solemn divine oath, Jesus has become the very guarantee and surety of a vastly superior covenant between God and man.

(Hebrews 7:7:23) 
The Levitical priests became numerous, one after another, precisely because they were all mortal and were prevented by death from remaining in their office permanently.

(Hebrews 7:7:24) 
But Jesus, because He lives and remains in His priesthood forever, possesses an unchangeable, permanent, and continuous priesthood.

(Hebrews 7:7:25) 
Therefore, He is also perfectly able to save for all eternity those who approach God the Father through Him, Jesus Christ. He is always living in heaven for the specific purpose of interceding before the Father on our behalf.

(Hebrews 7:7:26) 
For indeed, such a high priest was perfectly suited and necessary for us: one who is holy, innocent, and completely undefiled by sin, one who is set apart from sinners, and who has been exalted to a position higher than all the created skies and celestial realms.

(Hebrews 7:7:27) 
He has no need, as the Old Covenant priests did daily, to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and only then for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 7:7:28) 
For Christ accomplished this definitive act of atonement once and for all when He offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 8:1) 
The main point of everything we are saying is this: We have such a High Priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens —meaning He is in charge of all things,

(Hebrews 8:2) 
and He serves in the true holy places, in the true tabernacle —the actual dwelling place of God, which the Lord Himself established, not any human being.

(Hebrews 8:3) 
For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for Christ, our High Priest, to also have something to offer.

(Hebrews 8:4) 
If He were on Earth, He wouldn't even be a priest at all, because there are already priests who offer gifts according to the Law of Moses.

(Hebrews 8:5) 
These earthly priests serve only as a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities. This is just as God instructed Moses when he was about to build the earthly tabernacle: He said, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain” —referring to the divine blueprint God gave Moses.

(Hebrews 8:6) 
But now, Christ has obtained a much more excellent ministry, because He is the Mediator of a better covenant —a new agreement between God and humanity, which has been legally established on better promises.

(Hebrews 8:7) 
For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no reason to seek a second one.

(Hebrews 8:8) 
For God Himself found fault with them, saying through the prophet Jeremiah: “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;

(Hebrews 8:9) 
It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not remain faithful to My covenant, and so I turned away from them, declares the Lord.

(Hebrews 8:10) 
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

(Hebrews 8:11) 
And no one will have to teach his neighbor, or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because all of them will know Me, from the least to the greatest” —meaning all will have direct knowledge of God.

(Hebrews 8:12) 
For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”

(Hebrews 8:13) 
By speaking of a “new” covenant, God has made the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and aging is about to vanish completely.

(Hebrews 9:1) 
Indeed, the first covenant itself had its ordinances of worship, by which they would be made ritually right, and it had a sanctuary which was of this world, built on earth.

(Hebrews 9:2) 
For a tabernacle was set up, the first part. In this part were the lampstands, and the table, and the showbread. This first part is called the Holy Place.

(Hebrews 9:3) 
But behind the second veil was the second part of the tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies.

(Hebrews 9:4) 
This part contained a golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered on all sides with gold. Inside the Ark was a golden urn holding manna, and Aaron's rod which had miraculously budded, and the stone tablets on which the covenant was written.

(Hebrews 9:5) 
Above the Ark were the Cherubim of Glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. Now, it is not possible to speak in detail about each of these things.

(Hebrews 9:6) 
With all these things arranged in this way, the priests regularly entered the first part of the tabernacle. There, they performed the acts of worship and completed the sacrificial duties.

(Hebrews 9:7) 
But into the second part, the Holy of Holies, only the high priest entered, and only once a year. He never entered without blood, which he would offer for his own sins and for the sins committed by the people out of ignorance.

(Hebrews 9:8) 
By these arrangements, the Holy Spirit was indicating that the way into God's true holy presence was not yet fully opened to humanity, as long as the first, earthly tabernacle was still standing and operational.

(Hebrews 9:9) 
This earthly tabernacle is a symbol for the present time, a time in which gifts and sacrifices are still being offered that cannot, in good conscience, make the worshipper truly perfect before God.

(Hebrews 9:10) 
These rituals are only about external things: foods, drinks, various ceremonial washings, and other outward regulations for the flesh, all of which were imposed only until the time when God would establish a new, better order.

(Hebrews 9:11) 
But Christ has now come forward as the High Priest of the good things that were to come. He ministers through a tabernacle that is much greater and more perfect, one not made by human hands; that is to say, it is not part of this created world.

(Hebrews 9:12) 
He did not enter by the blood of goats or young bulls, as the earthly high priest did. Instead, He entered the true heavenly Holy of Holies once for all time, by His own precious blood, having secured eternal redemption for us.

(Hebrews 9:13) 
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ritually defiled, can make them outwardly holy for the cleansing of the flesh,

(Hebrews 9:14) 
then how much more powerfully will the blood of Christ cleanse our consciences from dead works! Christ, through the eternal Holy Spirit, offered Himself as a spotless sacrifice to God. His sacrifice purifies us so that we may truly serve the living God.

(Hebrews 9:15) 
And for this reason, Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant. His death has occurred as a ransom for the transgressions committed under the first covenant. This means that those who have been called by God can now receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.

(Hebrews 9:16) 
For where there is a testament—a will—it is absolutely necessary that the death of the one who made the will, the testator, has occurred for it to be valid.

(Hebrews 9:17) 
A will is only confirmed and becomes legally binding once the person who made it has died. Otherwise, it is not yet valid as long as the testator is still alive.

(Hebrews 9:18) 
This is why even the first covenant was not dedicated and made official without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:19) 
For after Moses had read every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, mixed it with water, and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle the book of the Law itself and all the people.

(Hebrews 9:20) 
He declared, 'This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you, marking His solemn agreement with you.'

(Hebrews 9:21) 
In the same way, Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels used for its service with blood.

(Hebrews 9:22) 
Indeed, according to the Law, almost everything is cleansed with blood, and there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:23) 
Therefore, it was necessary for the earthly copies of the heavenly realities to be cleansed with these kinds of animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly realities themselves had to be purified with far better sacrifices than these.

(Hebrews 9:24) 
For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by human hands, which is merely a copy of the true one. Instead, He entered into the universe itself, the true dwelling place of God, to appear now directly before the face of God on our behalf.

(Hebrews 9:25) 
Nor did Christ need to offer Himself repeatedly, as the earthly high priest enters the Holy of Holies year after year with blood that is not his own.

(Hebrews 9:26) 
If that were the case, then He would have had to suffer many times since the very beginning of the world. But instead, He has appeared only once, at the culmination of all ages, to put an end to sin definitively through His own sacrifice.

(Hebrews 9:27) 
And just as it is appointed for all human beings to die once, and after that comes the judgment,

(Hebrews 9:28) 
so also Christ was offered once to bear away the sins of many people. He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring full salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

(Hebrews 10:1) 
The Law of Moses was only a shadow of the good things that were to come, not the real and perfect substance of those things. Because of this, it could never make perfect those who constantly approached God through the same animal sacrifices offered year after year.

(Hebrews 10:2) 
If those sacrifices could have made people perfect, they would have stopped being offered. Because then, those who had been truly cleansed through that worship would no longer have been conscious of their sins.

(Hebrews 10:3) 
Instead, those sacrifices served as a reminder of sins every single year.

(Hebrews 10:4) 
This is because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to actually take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:5) 
This is why, when Jesus Christ came into the world, He said: 'You, O God, did not want the animal sacrifices and grain offerings from the Old Covenant. Instead, you specifically prepared a human body for me to offer.'

(Hebrews 10:6) 
'You were not pleased with the burnt offerings and sin offerings, because they could not truly remove sin.'

(Hebrews 10:7) 
'Then I, Jesus Christ, said: See, I have come! As it is written about Me in the scroll of the Law, I have come to do Your will, O God.'

(Hebrews 10:8) 
First, He said: 'You did not desire, nor were You pleased with, the sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings, which were offered according to the Law of Moses.'

(Hebrews 10:9) 
Then He added: 'See, I have come to do Your will, O God.' By saying this, He sets aside the old system of animal sacrifices in order to establish the new, perfect sacrifice of His own body.

(Hebrews 10:10) 
And it is by this specific will of God, fully accomplished by Jesus Christ, that we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.

(Hebrews 10:11) 
Indeed, every Old Covenant priest stands day after day performing his duties, repeatedly offering the same sacrifices, none of which can ever truly take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:12) 
But Jesus Christ, having offered one single sacrifice for sins that is perfect for all time, now sits forever at the right hand of God the Father in heaven.

(Hebrews 10:13) 
From that moment on, He waits until all His enemies are utterly subjected to Him, like a footstool under His feet.

(Hebrews 10:14) 
For by that one offering, He has permanently perfected and brought to their full spiritual end those who are being sanctified.

(Hebrews 10:15) 
The Holy Spirit Himself also confirms this truth to us; for after He (speaking through the Prophet Jeremiah) had declared:

(Hebrews 10:16) 
'This is the New Covenant I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord. 'I will put My divine laws into their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds.'

(Hebrews 10:17) 
'And I will no longer remember their sins and their lawless deeds.'

(Hebrews 10:18) 
Now, where there is this full and complete forgiveness of sins, there is no longer any need for a sacrifice for sin.

(Hebrews 10:19) 
Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, since we have confident access into the most holy presence of God, through the blood of Jesus Christ,

(Hebrews 10:20) 
through the new and living way that He opened for us. This way passes through the veil, which is to say, through His own physical body, broken on the Cross.

(Hebrews 10:21) 
And since we have Jesus Christ as our great High Priest, who presides over the spiritual house of God—the Church—

(Hebrews 10:22) 
let us draw near to God with sincere hearts, having full assurance of faith. Our hearts have been spiritually cleansed from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with the pure water of baptism.

(Hebrews 10:23) 
Let us hold firmly and without wavering to the profession of our Christian hope, because God, who has promised these things, is utterly faithful and will fulfill them.

(Hebrews 10:24) 
And let us consider how we can stir up one another to love and to good works of charity,

(Hebrews 10:25) 
not neglecting our communal gathering for worship, as some have made it their habit to do. Instead, let us encourage one another in our faith, and do this all the more as you see the Day of the Lord’s return drawing near.

(Hebrews 10:26) 
For if we deliberately and willfully continue to sin, after we have received and understood the full knowledge of the truth of Christ, then there no longer remains any other sacrifice that can atone for our sin.

(Hebrews 10:27) 
Instead, there remains only a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of an all-consuming fire that will justly devour those who oppose God.

(Hebrews 10:28) 
Anyone who rejected or nullified the Law of Moses was put to death without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.

(Hebrews 10:29) 
How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the person who has trampled underfoot the Son of God Himself? This person has treated as unholy the very blood of the New Covenant—the blood by which they were sanctified—and has grievously insulted the Holy Spirit of grace.

(Hebrews 10:30) 
For we know Him who said: 'Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay those who deserve it.' And again: 'The Lord will indeed judge His own people.'

(Hebrews 10:31) 
It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who will execute perfect justice.

(Hebrews 10:32) 
Remember the early days of your conversion, after you received the spiritual light of Christ. You endured a great struggle filled with suffering and persecution.

(Hebrews 10:33) 
Sometimes you were publicly exposed to shame and persecution, made a spectacle before others. At other times, you became sympathetic companions of those who were suffering such things.

(Hebrews 10:34) 
Indeed, you showed compassion to those who were imprisoned, and you cheerfully accepted the seizure of your own possessions. This was because you knew that you yourselves possessed a far better and an eternally enduring spiritual wealth.

(Hebrews 10:35) 
So then, do not throw away your courageous confidence in Christ, which is accompanied by a great and lasting reward.

(Hebrews 10:36) 
For you need to persevere with steadfast patience. Only by faithfully doing the will of God will you receive the fulfillment of His promises.

(Hebrews 10:37) 
For 'in a very little while now, He who is coming will come, and He will not delay!'

(Hebrews 10:38) 
'Now, my righteous one will live by faith.' But the Scripture also warns: 'If anyone shrinks back from this faith, My soul—God Himself—will take no pleasure in him.'

(Hebrews 10:39) 
But we are not those who shrink back from faith and are destined for perdition and eternal loss. Instead, we are those who hold fast to faith, leading to the preservation and eternal salvation of our souls.

(Hebrews 11:1) 
Now, faith is the actual, underlying reality of all that we hope for;
it is the conviction and proof of things we cannot yet see.

(Hebrews 11:2) 
For through this kind of faith, the holy people of ancient times received God's full approval.

(Hebrews 11:3) 
By faith we understand that the entire universe was perfectly ordered and made by God the Son’s spoken Word,
so that everything we can see was made from things that are invisible.

(Hebrews 11:4) 
By faith, Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice to God than Cain did.
Through this faith, he received God's approval as righteous, for God Himself bore witness to his offerings.
And even though he is long dead, through his faith, he still speaks to us.

(Hebrews 11:5) 
By faith, Enoch was taken away from this world so that he would not experience death;
he could not be found, because God had taken him.
Before he was taken, he had already received God’s approval, for he had pleased God.

(Hebrews 11:6) 
But without faith, it is impossible to please God.
For anyone who wishes to draw near to God must believe that He exists,
and that He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

(Hebrews 11:7) 
By faith, Noah, after receiving a divine warning about things that were not yet visible (the coming flood),
was reverently moved and prepared an ark for the salvation of his household.
Through this act of faith, he condemned the faithless world around him
and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.

(Hebrews 11:8) 
By faith, Abraham, when he was called by God,
obeyed by going out to a place that he was later to receive as an inheritance;
he left his home not knowing where he was going, trusting only in God.

(Hebrews 11:9) 
By faith, he lived as a temporary resident in the land that had been promised to him, treating it as a foreign country.
He lived in tents, along with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs of the same divine promise.

(Hebrews 11:10) 
For Abraham was looking forward to the heavenly city that has firm foundations,
a city whose divine architect and builder is God Himself.

(Hebrews 11:11) 
By faith, even Sarah herself, though she was barren and past the age of childbearing,
received the divine power to conceive a child,
because she believed that the One who had given the promise was faithful.

(Hebrews 11:12) 
Therefore, from one man, who was as good as dead (due to his old age),
were born descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky
and as countless as the sand on the seashore.

(Hebrews 11:13) 
All these faithful people died in faith, without having received the full fulfillment of the promises themselves.
Instead, they saw and greeted them from afar,
and confessed that they were strangers and temporary residents on this earth.

(Hebrews 11:14) 
For those who speak in this manner plainly declare that they are seeking their true, heavenly homeland.

(Hebrews 11:15) 
And if they had indeed kept in mind the earthly country from which they departed,
they would have had plenty of opportunity to return to it.

(Hebrews 11:16) 
But as it is, they desired a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
for He has prepared a heavenly city for them.

(Hebrews 11:17) 
By faith, Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him.
He, who had received the divine promises, was willing to offer his only son of the promise.

(Hebrews 11:18) 
It was about Isaac that God had said, 'It is through Isaac that your lineage of promised descendants will be named and established'.

(Hebrews 11:19) 
Abraham reasoned that God was powerful enough to raise Isaac even from the dead.
And indeed, from that event, he received Isaac back as a symbolic representation of a greater resurrection.

(Hebrews 11:20) 
By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, speaking prophetically about their future.

(Hebrews 11:21) 
By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons.
And he worshipped God, bowing down while leaning on the top of his staff.

(Hebrews 11:22) 
By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the future departure of the children of Israel from Egypt,
and he gave specific instructions concerning his bones.

(Hebrews 11:23) 
By faith, when Moses was born, he was hidden for three months by his parents,
because they saw that he was an exceptionally beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's cruel edict to kill all male infants.

(Hebrews 11:24) 
By faith, Moses, when he had grown to adulthood, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

(Hebrews 11:25) 
choosing instead to suffer affliction with the people of God,
rather than to enjoy the fleeting and temporary pleasures of sin.

(Hebrews 11:26) 
He considered the suffering and disgrace endured for the sake of the Messiah to be far greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt,
for he was looking forward to God's eternal reward.

(Hebrews 11:27) 
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the fierce wrath of the king.
For he persevered, seeing the invisible God as clearly as if He were visible.

(Hebrews 11:28) 
By faith, he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of blood,
so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the children of Israel.

(Hebrews 11:29) 
By faith, the Israelites passed through the Red Sea as if on dry ground.
But when the Egyptians attempted to do the same, they were swallowed up and drowned.

(Hebrews 11:30) 
By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.

(Hebrews 11:31) 
By faith, Rahab, who had been a harlot, did not perish with those who disobeyed God,
because she welcomed the Israelite spies in peace.

(Hebrews 11:32) 
And what more shall I say?
For I do not have enough time to tell of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.

(Hebrews 11:33) 
Through faith, these men conquered kingdoms, administered true justice, obtained divine promises,
and stopped the mouths of lions.

(Hebrews 11:34) 
They quenched the power of fiery attacks, escaped the sharp edge of the sword,
recovered from severe illness and weakness, became valiant in battle, and routed the invading armies of foreigners.

(Hebrews 11:35) 
Women received their dead loved ones back to life through a resurrection.
But others were tortured, refusing to accept release or deliverance from their suffering,
in order that they might attain a better resurrection unto eternal life.

(Hebrews 11:36) 
Still others endured severe ridicule and painful flogging,
and even suffered chains and imprisonment.

(Hebrews 11:37) 
They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they faced extreme trials and temptations, they were put to death by the sword.
They wandered about in garments of animal skins, being destitute, persecuted, and cruelly treated.

(Hebrews 11:38) 
The world was not worthy of these faithful ones.
They wandered in deserts and mountains, and lived in dens and caves of the earth.

(Hebrews 11:39) 
And all these, though they obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not receive the full ultimate promise of God.

(Hebrews 11:40) 
This was because God had foreseen something even better for us, the New Covenant,
so that they would not be made perfect or reach their ultimate fulfillment without us.

(Hebrews 12:12:1) 
Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of Saints as witnesses surrounding us, let us put aside every burden and every sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the struggle that is set before us.

(Hebrews 12:12:2) 
Let us look to Jesus, the One who authored and perfected our faith. For the joy that was set before Him, He patiently endured the cross, despising its shame, and He now sits at the right hand of God's throne.

(Hebrews 12:12:3) 
For consider Jesus, who endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, so that you do not grow weary and lose heart in your souls.

(Hebrews 12:12:4) 
For in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood for the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:5) 
And you have forgotten the exhortation that speaks to you as God's children, saying: "My child, do not neglect the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when you are corrected by Him."

(Hebrews 12:12:6) 
For the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He scourges every child whom He accepts as His own.

(Hebrews 12:12:7) 
Endure with discipline. God is dealing with you as His true children, for what child is there whom a father does not correct and train?

(Hebrews 12:12:8) 
But if you are without discipline—which all legitimate children of God share in—then you are illegitimate and not true children.

(Hebrews 12:12:9) 
Furthermore, we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us. Should we not much more readily submit to the Father of our spirits and truly live and be saved?

(Hebrews 12:12:10) 
For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a short time, according to what they thought best. But God disciplines us for our ultimate good, so that we may partake in His divine holiness and become Saints.

(Hebrews 12:12:11) 
Now, all discipline, while it is happening, seems to bring sorrow rather than joy. But afterwards, for those who have been trained by it, it yields the most peaceful fruit of true righteousness and justice.

(Hebrews 12:12:12) 
Therefore, strengthen your drooping hands and feeble knees,

(Hebrews 12:12:13) 
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed and strengthened.

(Hebrews 12:12:14) 
Pursue peace with all people, and pursue holiness, for without holiness no one will see God.

(Hebrews 12:12:15) 
Look diligently to it that no one fails to obtain God's grace, and that no root of bitterness springs up to cause trouble, by which many are defiled and turned away from the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:16) 
See to it that no one is sexually immoral or profane, like Esau, who for a single meal sold his divine birthright as the firstborn.

(Hebrews 12:12:17) 
For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He found no opportunity for true repentance, even though he sought it diligently with tears.

(Hebrews 12:12:18) 
For you have not come to a tangible mountain, Mount Sinai, that could be touched—a mountain blazing with fire, surrounded by a whirlwind, darkness, and storm,

(Hebrews 12:12:19) 
nor to the sound of a trumpet, nor to a voice speaking words so terrifying that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them.

(Hebrews 12:12:20) 
For they could not endure the command that was given: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."

(Hebrews 12:12:21) 
So terrifying was that sight that even Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."

(Hebrews 12:12:22) 
But you have come instead to Mount Sion, to the city of the living God, which is the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

(Hebrews 12:12:23) 
and to the Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in the heavenly registry, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect,

(Hebrews 12:12:24) 
and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks a better word than the blood of Abel, which cries out for vengeance.

(Hebrews 12:12:25) 
See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if those who refused Him who spoke on Earth, the Law through Moses, did not escape punishment, how much less shall we escape if we turn away from Him who speaks to us from the heavens, Jesus Christ!

(Hebrews 12:12:26) 
His voice then shook the Earth at Sinai, but now He has promised, saying: "Yet once more, I will shake not only the Earth, but also the entire created universe."

(Hebrews 12:12:27) 
Now, this phrase "Yet once more" signifies the removal of created things that can be shaken, so that those things that cannot be shaken may remain and stand firm forever.

(Hebrews 12:12:28) 
Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable Kingdom, let us be grateful, and by this gratitude, let us serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.

(Hebrews 12:12:29) 
For our God is a consuming fire, a refining fire that purifies His Saints and destroys His enemies.

(Hebrews 13:13:1) 
Let the love of your fellow Christians remain in your hearts.

(Hebrews 13:13:2) 
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. Through this practice, some people have unknowingly given shelter to angels.

(Hebrews 13:13:3) 
Remember those who are imprisoned for their faith, as if you yourselves were chained with them. Also, remember those who are suffering, as if you yourselves were experiencing the same physical hardships.

(Hebrews 13:13:4) 
Let marriage be held in honor by all people, and let the marriage bed remain undefiled by sin. For God will certainly judge those who engage in sexual immorality and adultery.

(Hebrews 13:13:5) 
Your way of life should be free from the sin of avarice. Be content with the material blessings you currently possess. For God Himself has promised us, saying: "I will never abandon you; nor will I ever desert you."

(Hebrews 13:13:6) 
So, with firm confidence, we can proclaim: "The Lord is my unfailing helper and protector. Therefore, I will not fear anything that any human being can do to harm me."

(Hebrews 13:13:7) 
Remember your spiritual leaders, the ones who first taught you the saving Word of God. Consider carefully the outcome of their way of life, how they persevered in faith until death, and imitate their unwavering faith in God.

(Hebrews 13:13:8) 
Jesus Christ is the same divine person always. He was the same yesterday, He is the same today, and He will remain the same for all eternity.

(Hebrews 13:13:9) 
Do not allow yourselves to be led astray by various and unfamiliar doctrines. It is far better for your heart to be strengthened and established by God's grace, rather than by rules concerning foods, which have proven useless to those who meticulously observed them.

(Hebrews 13:13:10) 
We Christians have a spiritual altar, from which to eat. Those who continue to serve in the Old Covenant tabernacle rituals have no right or power to partake of this new, perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 13:13:11) 
In the Old Covenant, the blood of certain animals was brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest to atone for sin. The bodies of those very animals were then burned completely outside the camp of Israel.

(Hebrews 13:13:12) 
For this reason, Jesus Himself, in order to sanctify His people through the shedding of His own precious blood, suffered and died outside the city gate of Jerusalem.

(Hebrews 13:13:13) 
Let us, therefore, courageously go forth from the old ways and join Him outside the camp, willingly bearing the same scorn and disgrace that He endured.

(Hebrews 13:13:14) 
For we do not possess a permanent earthly city or homeland in this present world. Instead, we are earnestly seeking the heavenly city and everlasting Kingdom that is yet to come.

(Hebrews 13:13:15) 
Therefore, through Jesus Christ, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise. This sacrifice is the spiritual fruit of our lips, which confess and glorify His holy Name.

(Hebrews 13:13:16) 
Moreover, do not forget to do good works for others and to share your material possessions with those in need. For God is truly pleased and propitiated by such sacrifices of charity.

(Hebrews 13:13:17) 
Obey your spiritual leaders and humbly submit to their authority. For they diligently watch over your immortal souls, knowing that they will one day have to give an account to God for their stewardship. Obey them so that they may carry out their duties with joy, and not with sorrowful groaning, for that would certainly not be beneficial for your spiritual welfare.

(Hebrews 13:13:18) 
Please pray for us, your spiritual guides. We are confident that we possess a good and clear conscience in all matters, as we earnestly desire to conduct ourselves honorably in every aspect of our lives.

(Hebrews 13:13:19) 
I especially implore you to pray for this specific intention: that I may be restored to your presence more quickly.

(Hebrews 13:13:20) 
Now, may God, the very source of all peace, who, through the precious blood of the eternal covenant, brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of His flock,

(Hebrews 13:13:21) 
may He perfectly equip and prepare you in every good work, enabling you to faithfully accomplish His divine will. May He accomplish within you, through Jesus Christ, that which is truly pleasing in His sight. To this same Jesus Christ be all glory and honor, for all ages, forever and ever. Amen.

(Hebrews 13:13:22) 
Now, brothers and sisters, I earnestly ask you to patiently receive this message of consolation and encouragement. For, indeed, I have written to you in a relatively brief manner.

(Hebrews 13:13:23) 
Understand that our brother Timothy has been released from his confinement. If he arrives quickly, I plan to visit you along with him.

(Hebrews 13:13:24) 
Extend my greetings to all your spiritual leaders, and to all the holy people in your community. The Christian believers here in Italy also send their greetings to you.

(Hebrews 13:13:25) 
May the grace of God be with all of you. Amen.

(James 1:James 1:1) 
James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, sends greetings to the twelve tribes who are scattered abroad.

(James 1:James 1:2) 
My brothers, consider it a cause for total joy when you encounter many different kinds of trials.

(James 1:James 1:3) 
This is because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance within you.

(James 1:James 1:4) 
But perseverance must do its perfect work so that you may become perfect and complete, lacking nothing spiritually.

(James 1:James 1:5) 
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all and does not reproach anyone for asking, and it will be given to him.

(James 1:James 1:6) 
But let him ask in faith, without any doubting in his mind. For whoever doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind.

(James 1:James 1:7) 
Let that man not imagine that he will receive anything from the Lord.

(James 1:James 1:8) 
A man who is double-minded is unstable in all his ways and actions.

(James 1:James 1:9) 
But let the brother of humble means glory in his true exaltation, which is God's grace.

(James 1:James 1:10) 
And let the rich man glory in his humility, because he will pass away like the flower of the field.

(James 1:James 1:11) 
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. Its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance perishes completely. So also will the rich man fade away in all his worldly endeavors.

(James 1:James 1:12) 
Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because when he has been proven to be faithful, he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love Him.

(James 1:James 1:13) 
Let no one who is tempted say that he is being tempted by God. For God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself tempts no one to do evil.

(James 1:James 1:14) 
But each person is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own evil desires.

(James 1:James 1:15) 
Then, when evil desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And when sin is fully grown, it brings forth eternal death.

(James 1:James 1:16) 
Do not be deceived, my most beloved brothers.

(James 1:James 1:17) 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of change.

(James 1:James 1:18) 
By His own will, He brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creation.

(James 1:James 1:19) 
You know this, my most beloved brothers. But let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.

(James 1:James 1:20) 
For the anger of man does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

(James 1:James 1:21) 
Therefore, cast off all impurity and every overflowing remnant of malice. And humbly receive the implanted word of God, which has the power to save your souls.

(James 1:James 1:22) 
But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves with false piety.

(James 1:James 1:23) 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.

(James 1:James 1:24) 
For he observes himself, then walks away, and immediately forgets what he was like.

(James 1:James 1:25) 
But whoever looks intently into the perfect law of liberty and perseveres in it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer who acts upon it—that man will be blessed in what he does.

(James 1:James 1:26) 
If anyone thinks he is religious, yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is utterly worthless.

(James 1:James 1:27) 
Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world's sinful ways.

(James 2:2:1) 
My beloved brothers, do not act partially, nor show favoritism, as you hold to the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.

(James 2:2:2) 
For if a man wearing an expensive gold ring and splendid attire enters your gathering, and then also a poor man in filthy, worn-out clothing enters,

(James 2:2:3) 
and you focus your attention on the one wearing the splendid clothing, and you say to him, “You, sit here, in a place of honor.” But to the poor man you say, “You, stand over there,” or, “Sit down here on the floor, at my feet.”

(James 2:2:4) 
In doing so, are you not making distinctions among yourselves, and have you not become judges whose very thoughts are evil?

(James 2:2:5) 
Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in the gift of faith, and to be heirs of the Kingdom that God promised to those who love Him?

(James 2:2:6) 
But you, on the other hand, have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by their great power? And is it not they who drag you into court?

(James 2:2:7) 
Do not the rich blaspheme the holy name of God, by which you are known as Christians?

(James 2:2:8) 
If you truly fulfill the royal law, which is the supreme law found in the Scriptures: “You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself”—you are doing well.

(James 2:2:9) 
But if you show partiality to persons, you are committing a sin, and you stand condemned by the law as lawbreakers.

(James 2:2:10) 
For whoever keeps the entire law, yet stumbles in even one command, has become guilty of breaking all of it.

(James 2:2:11) 
For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not kill.” If you do not commit adultery, but you do kill, then you have become a transgressor of the entire law.

(James 2:2:12) 
Therefore, speak in this way and act in this way, understanding that you will be judged by the law that grants true freedom in Christ.

(James 2:2:13) 
For merciless judgment awaits the one who has shown no mercy. However, divine mercy triumphs over judgment itself.

(James 2:2:14) 
What good is it, my beloved brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no good works to show for it? Can that kind of empty faith save him?

(James 2:2:15) 
If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking daily food,

(James 2:2:16) 
and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and well-fed,” yet you do not give them what their bodies truly need—what good is such an empty blessing?

(James 2:2:17) 
In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have good works, is dead and worthless.

(James 2:2:18) 
But someone might say, “You have faith, and I have works.” My answer to him is: “Show me your faith, if it is without any good works to prove it; but I, for my part, will show you my faith through my good works.”

(James 2:2:19) 
You believe that there is only one God. You do well to believe this! Yet, even the demons believe that, and they tremble with fear at His power.

(James 2:2:20) 
But do you wish to know, O man of empty understanding, that faith without good works is truly dead and useless?

(James 2:2:21) 
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by his good works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?

(James 2:2:22) 
You see then that his faith was working together with his good works, and by his good works, his faith was made perfect and complete.

(James 2:2:23) 
And in this way, the Scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham believed God, and his belief was counted to him as righteousness.” And he was called “the Friend of God.”

(James 2:2:24) 
You see then that a man is justified by his good works, and not by faith alone.

(James 2:2:25) 
In the same way, was not Rahab, the harlot, also justified by her good works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different path?

(James 2:2:26) 
For just as the body without a soul is dead, so also faith without good works is dead.

(James 3:1) 
My brothers, do not be eager to become teachers among yourselves, because those who teach will be judged more strictly by God.

(James 3:2) 
For we all stumble and make mistakes in many ways. If someone never makes a mistake with their words, that person is truly a perfect man. Such a one is powerful enough to guide and control their entire body, just as a horse is led by a bridle.

(James 3:3) 
Consider how we put a bridle into a horse's mouth so that it will obey us. With that bridle, we can guide its entire body wherever we wish.

(James 3:4) 
Or consider ships, which are very large and are driven by strong winds. They are steered by a very small rudder, guided by the intention of the pilot.

(James 3:5) 
In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it makes great boasts. Just see how a tiny spark of fire can set an entire forest ablaze!

(James 3:6) 
And the tongue itself is a fire; it is a complete realm of evil. The tongue is set among our body parts, and it can corrupt the entire body. It sets on fire the entire course of our lives and our destiny, because it is ignited by Gehenna—that is, by the forces of hell.

(James 3:7) 
For every kind of wild animal, and of birds, and of serpents, and of all other creatures on land and in the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.

(James 3:8) 
But no one among humanity has the power to tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

(James 3:9) 
With the tongue, we bless God the Father. Yet with the very same tongue, we curse men who are made in the likeness of God Himself.

(James 3:10) 
From the very same mouth comes both blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right that these things should happen this way.

(James 3:11) 
Can a spring pour forth fresh water and bitter water from the same opening at the same time?

(James 3:12) 
My brothers, can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and neither can a spring produce both salty and fresh water from the same source.

(James 3:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is wise and truly understanding? Let that person show their good works by living a good life, demonstrating their actions with the gentleness that comes from true wisdom.

(James 3:14) 
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, then do not boast of your wisdom and do not lie against the truth revealed by God.

(James 3:15) 
For this kind of so-called 'wisdom' does not descend from Heaven, from God. Instead, it is earthly in its origin, unspiritual in its nature, and demonic in its source.

(James 3:16) 
For wherever you find envy and selfish ambition, there you will also find disorder and every kind of evil practice.

(James 3:17) 
But the wisdom that comes from Heaven, from God, is first of all pure. Then it is peaceable, gentle, and willing to yield to what is right. It is full of mercy and produces good fruits, showing no partiality and acting without hypocrisy.

(James 3:18) 
And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace, by those who are peacemakers.

(James 4:1) 
Where do wars and quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this: from your sinful desires, which wage war within your very bodies and souls?

(James 4:2) 
You crave things, and yet you do not have them. You would murder to get them, and you are consumed by envy, yet you still cannot obtain what you want. You quarrel and wage war, yet you do not have what you desire, because you do not ask God for it.

(James 4:3) 
You ask for things, and you do not receive them, because your intentions for asking are evil; you only ask to spend it on your disordered passions.

(James 4:4) 
You spiritually unfaithful people! Do you not know that friendship with this present age is enmity against God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of this world's ways makes himself an enemy of God.

(James 4:5) 
Or do you think that the Scripture speaks in vain when it says: The Holy Spirit who dwells within you yearns jealously for your faithfulness, seeking you solely for Himself?

(James 4:6) 
But God gives even greater grace. This is why it says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

(James 4:7) 
Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

(James 4:8) 
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you who are double-minded and divided in your loyalty.

(James 4:9) 
Be wretched, mourn, and weep over your sins. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.

(James 4:10) 
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.

(James 4:11) 
Brothers, do not speak evil of one another. Whoever speaks evil of his brother, or judges his brother, speaks evil of the Law of God and presumes to judge the Law itself.

(James 4:12) 
But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but its judge.

(James 4:13) 
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, God alone. He has the power to destroy and to save souls.

(James 4:14) 
But who are you, a mere human, to judge your neighbor?

(James 4:15) 
Now listen, you who say: “Today or tomorrow, we will go to such and such a city, and we will spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”:

(James 4:16) 
But you do not even know what tomorrow will bring, or if you will be alive.

(James 4:17) 
What is your life, after all? It is merely a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes into nothingness.

(James 4:18) 
Instead of saying, as you should: “If the Lord wills it, and if we live, we will do this or that.”

(James 4:19) 
But as it is, you boast in your arrogant plans, full of pride and presumption.

(James 4:20) 
All such boasting is evil and inspired by malice against God's Providence.

(James 4:21) 
Therefore, to anyone who knows what is good and right to do, but intentionally does not do it, for him it is a sin.

(James 5:1) 
Now listen, you rich people, and start to wail and cry out, because terrible suffering is coming upon you.

(James 5:2) 
Your accumulated wealth has rotted away, and your fine clothing has been devoured by moths.

(James 5:3) 
Your gold and silver have become corroded and worthless. That very corrosion will stand as evidence against you, and it will consume your bodies as if by fire. You have spent your time hoarding up worldly riches and storing up God's wrath for yourselves in these final days before Christ's return.

(James 5:4) 
Look! The wages of the workers who harvested your crops, wages you fraudulently withheld from them, are now crying out against you. The cries of those workers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts, the God of all armies in heaven and on earth.

(James 5:5) 
You have lived lives of opulent indulgence on earth, and you have fattened your hearts as if for a day of slaughter, oblivious to the coming judgment.

(James 5:6) 
You have condemned and even murdered the righteous, and they offered no resistance to your injustices.

(James 5:7) 
Therefore, be patient, my brothers and sisters, enduring until the Lord's return. Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the valuable produce of the earth. He endures patiently until the ground receives both the early autumn rains for planting and the late spring rains for harvest.

(James 5:8) 
You also must be patient and strengthen your resolve, because the Lord's return is drawing near.

(James 5:9) 
Do not grumble or complain against one another, my brothers and sisters, so that you yourselves will not be judged for it. Remember, the Judge is already standing at the door, ready to enter.

(James 5:10) 
My brothers and sisters, take the prophets, who spoke on behalf of the Lord, as an example of endurance through suffering and of unwavering patience.

(James 5:11) 
Indeed, we acknowledge as blessed those who have patiently endured. You have heard about the steadfast endurance of Job through his trials, and you have seen the Lord’s ultimate purpose in his story, for the Lord is full of mercy and compassion.

(James 5:12) 
But above all, my beloved brothers and sisters, do not swear oaths at all—not by the sky, nor by the earth, nor by any other created thing. Instead, let your simple affirmation be 'yes,' and your simple denial be 'no,' so that you do not fall under the judgment of God.

(James 5:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is suffering hardship or sorrow? Then that person should pray. Is there anyone who is joyful and content? Then that person should sing praises to God.

(James 5:14) 
Is anyone among you gravely ill? That person should call for the priests of the Church, and they should pray over him, anointing him with blessed oil in the Name of the Lord Our God, according to the holy Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

(James 5:15) 
And the prayer offered with sincere faith will bring healing to the sick person, and the Lord will raise him from his affliction. And if he has committed any sins, those sins will be forgiven him.

(James 5:16) 
Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed and saved. For the persistent and fervent prayer of a righteous person has tremendous power before God.

(James 5:17) 
Elijah was a human being just like us, sharing in all our human frailties. Yet he prayed with such fervent prayer that it would not rain on the earth, and indeed, it did not rain for three years and six months.

(James 5:18) 
Then he prayed once more, and the sky gave forth its rain, and the earth produced an abundant harvest of its fruit.

(James 5:19) 
My brothers and sisters, if any of you has strayed from the truth of the Catholic Faith, and someone else brings him back,

(James 5:20) 
that person should know that whoever leads a sinner to repent and turn back from his mistaken path will save that sinner's soul from eternal death and cover a multitude of sins for them both.

(1 Peter 1:1) 
Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to God's chosen ones—all those who live as spiritual exiles, scattered throughout the regions of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

(1 Peter 1:2) 
These chosen ones are known by the foreknowledge of God the Father, and they are set apart by the Holy Spirit for a life of obedience, purified by the sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied abundantly in you.

(1 Peter 1:3) 
Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of His immense mercy, He has given us new birth, so that we now live in a true and living hope, all through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

(1 Peter 1:4) 
This new birth leads to an inheritance that can never decay, spoil, or fade away—an inheritance kept safe in heaven for all of you.

(1 Peter 1:5) 
Through your faith, you are being guarded by the power of God for a salvation that is ready to be fully revealed in the last days of this age.

(1 Peter 1:6) 
Because of this hope, you will greatly rejoice, even though for a short time—if it is necessary—you may have to suffer various trials and tests.

(1 Peter 1:7) 
This happens so that the genuineness of your faith—which is far more precious than perishable gold, even gold refined by fire—may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is fully revealed.

(1 Peter 1:8) 
Even though you have never seen Him, you love Him. And even though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him. And because you believe, you rejoice with an inexpressible joy that is already filled with glory.

(1 Peter 1:9) 
You are already receiving the ultimate goal of your faith: the salvation of your souls.

(1 Peter 1:10) 
Concerning this very salvation, the prophets of old meticulously searched and diligently inquired. They were the ones who prophesied about the grace that would eventually come to you.

(1 Peter 1:11) 
They were earnestly seeking to understand what specific time or circumstances the Spirit of Christ, who was within them, was indicating. The Spirit had foretold Christ's sufferings and the glories that would follow.

(1 Peter 1:12) 
It was revealed to those prophets that they were not serving themselves, but rather serving you, when they ministered these truths. Now, these same truths have been announced to you through those who preached the Gospel to you, empowered by the Holy Spirit sent from God's heavenly domain. These are truths so profound that even the angels long to look into them.

(1 Peter 1:13) 
Therefore, prepare your minds for action by mentally girding yourselves, and be alert and self-controlled. Place your complete hope in the grace that will be brought to you at the full revelation of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 1:14) 
As truly obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the evil desires that you once had when you lived in ignorance of God's ways.

(1 Peter 1:15) 
Instead, just as the One who called you is holy, you yourselves must also be holy in all aspects of your conduct and way of life.

(1 Peter 1:16) 
For the Scripture says: 'You shall be holy, because I am holy.'

(1 Peter 1:17) 
And if you call upon Him as Father—the One who judges each person's actions impartially, without favoritism—then live your lives in reverent fear during this time of your earthly pilgrimage.

(1 Peter 1:18) 
For you know very well that you were not set free from your futile way of life, inherited from your ancestors, by anything perishable like silver or gold.

(1 Peter 1:19) 
Instead, you were set free by the precious Blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.

(1 Peter 1:20) 
He was known by God the Father before the creation of the world, but He was fully revealed in these last times for your sake.

(1 Peter 1:21) 
Through Christ, you are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory. This was done so that your faith and hope might be securely placed in God.

(1 Peter 1:22) 
Now that you have purified your souls through obedience to the truth, leading to sincere fraternal love, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.

(1 Peter 1:23) 
You have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed, through the living and eternally enduring Word of God.

(1 Peter 1:24) 
For 'All human life is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, and the flower falls away.'

(1 Peter 1:25) 
But the Word of the Lord remains forever.' This is the very Word that was proclaimed to you through the Gospel.

(1 Peter 2:1) 
Therefore, you must put away all malice, all deceit, all hypocrisy, all envy, and all forms of slander.

(1 Peter 2:2) 
Like spiritual newborns, you must truly desire the pure, unadulterated spiritual milk of God's truth, so that by it you may grow in the Lord and attain salvation.

(1 Peter 2:3) 
Do this especially if you have already experienced how good the Lord is.

(1 Peter 2:4) 
Come to Jesus, the Living Stone. He was rejected by men, yet God chose Him and honored Him greatly.

(1 Peter 2:5) 
You yourselves are also like living stones, being built into a spiritual house. This house is a holy priesthood, whose purpose is to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

(1 Peter 2:6) 
For this reason, the Scripture states: 'Behold, I am placing in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen and precious. Whoever believes in Him will never be put to shame.'

(1 Peter 2:7) 
Therefore, honor belongs to you who believe. But for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner—the most important stone.

(1 Peter 2:8) 
To unbelievers, He is a stumbling stone and a rock that causes them to fall. They stumble because they disobey the word of God by not believing in Him, and this is the purpose for which they were appointed.

(1 Peter 2:9) 
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God Himself. You are chosen so that you may proclaim the wonderful works of Him who called you out of the darkness of sin and into His marvelous light.

(1 Peter 2:10) 
In the past, you were not God's people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received God's mercy.

(1 Peter 2:11) 
Beloved, I urge you as temporary residents and sojourners in this world to abstain from fleshly desires. These desires war against your very soul.

(1 Peter 2:12) 
Maintain excellent conduct among the Gentiles. Then, even when they falsely accuse you as evildoers, they will observe your good works. In doing so, they will give glory to God when He comes to judge the world.

(1 Peter 2:13) 
Be subject to every human authority for the Lord's sake. This includes the king as the supreme authority.

(1 Peter 2:14) 
It also includes governors who are sent by the king to punish evildoers and to praise those who do good.

(1 Peter 2:15) 
For it is God's will that by doing good, you silence the ignorant accusations of foolish people.

(1 Peter 2:16) 
Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cloak to conceal evil. Instead, live as servants of God.

(1 Peter 2:17) 
Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood of believers. Fear God above all. Honor the king.

(1 Peter 2:18) 
Servants, be subject to your masters with all reverence. This applies not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are difficult or harsh.

(1 Peter 2:19) 
For this is a gracious act in the eyes of God: if, because of your devotion and conscience toward God, you endure sorrows, even when suffering unjustly.

(1 Peter 2:20) 
What glory is there if you endure a beating when you have sinned? But if you endure patiently while doing good, this is truly a gracious act in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 2:21) 
For you were called to this very purpose: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example so that you might follow in His footsteps.

(1 Peter 2:22) 
He committed no sin, and no deceit was ever found in His mouth.

(1 Peter 2:23) 
When He was reviled with insults, He did not return insults. When He suffered, He did not threaten vengeance. Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges righteously.

(1 Peter 2:24) 
He Himself carried our sins in His own body on the wood of the Cross. This was so that we, having died to the power of sin, might live for righteousness. By His wounds, you have been healed of your spiritual maladies.

(1 Peter 2:25) 
For you were like sheep who had gone astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.

(1 Peter 3:1) 
Likewise, wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if some of them are disobedient to the Gospel, you may win them over not by preaching, but by your chaste conduct, lived in proper reverence and respect for God.

(1 Peter 3:2) 
They will observe your pure, chaste, and respectful behavior.

(1 Peter 3:3) 
Your adornment should not be merely an outward display of elaborate hairstyles, or of gold jewelry, or of dressing in fashionable clothing.

(1 Peter 3:4) 
Rather, let your beauty be the hidden inner person of the heart, manifested by the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious and valuable in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 3:5) 
For this is how the holy women of old, who put their hope in God, used to adorn themselves: by being submissive to their own husbands.

(1 Peter 3:6) 
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him 'lord' as a sign of respect. You are her true spiritual daughters if you do good and are not intimidated by any kind of fear that might arise from your good actions.

(1 Peter 3:7) 
Husbands, likewise, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the female, considering her the physically weaker vessel. Also, regard them as co-heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.

(1 Peter 3:8) 
Finally, all of you should be of one mind and purpose, sympathetic to one another, loving as brothers and sisters, compassionate, humble in spirit.

(1 Peter 3:9) 
Do not return evil for evil, nor insult for insult. Instead, return a blessing; for this is why God has called you: to inherit a blessing from Him.

(1 Peter 3:10) 
For he who desires to love life and to see good days must keep his tongue from speaking evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.

(1 Peter 3:11) 
He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and actively pursue it.

(1 Peter 3:12) 
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers. But the face of the Lord is set against those who do evil.

(1 Peter 3:13) 
And who will harm you if you are zealous for what is good and eager to do it?

(1 Peter 3:14) 
But even if you suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear the threats of those who oppose you, and do not be troubled by them.

(1 Peter 3:15) 
Instead, sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always be ready to give an adequate explanation to anyone who asks you for the reason for the hope that is within you.

(1 Peter 3:16) 
But do this with gentleness and reverence, maintaining a good conscience. Then, in the very matter that they speak evil of you, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ will be shamed.

(1 Peter 3:17) 
For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is God's will, than to suffer for doing evil.

(1 Peter 3:18) 
For Christ also suffered once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but brought to life by the Holy Spirit.

(1 Peter 3:19) 
In this same Holy Spirit, He also went and proclaimed His victory to the spirits who were being held in the realm of the dead.

(1 Peter 3:20) 
These were the ones who were disobedient long ago, when God's patience waited during the days of Noah, as the ark was being built. In that ark, a few—that is, eight souls—were saved through water.

(1 Peter 3:21) 
Baptism, which is a corresponding sign to that event, now saves you as well. It is not merely the removal of dirt from the body, but rather the appeal or commitment of a good conscience to God, made possible through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 3:22) 
He is now at the right hand of God, having completely swallowed death so that we might be made heirs of eternal life. He has ascended into the created universe, to a place beyond our sight, and all angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to Him.

(1 Peter 4:1) 
Since Christ suffered for you in the flesh, you also should arm yourselves with the same mindset. This is the mindset that whoever suffers in the flesh—as Christ did—is finished with the life of sin.

(1 Peter 4:2) 
This means that for the rest of your time in this bodily life, you should no longer live according to worldly human desires, but according to the will and commandments of God.

(1 Peter 4:3) 
The time you have already spent living according to the ways of non-believers is enough. That past life was filled with excessive pleasures, sinful desires, habitual drunkenness, wild parties, public carousing, and the forbidden worship of idols.

(1 Peter 4:4) 
Because you no longer join them in that same flood of debauchery and sin, they are surprised. And because they are surprised, they speak evil of you and blaspheme God.

(1 Peter 4:5) 
But those who blaspheme you will have to give an account to the Lord. He is prepared and ready to judge all people, both those who are still alive and those who have died.

(1 Peter 4:6) 
For this very purpose, the Good News was also preached to those who are now dead in their bodies. The purpose was that even though they might be judged in their human nature by men —meaning they suffered physical death—they might still live in their spirit according to the eternal life given by God.

(1 Peter 4:7) 
Now, the culmination and end of all things is drawing near. Therefore, be clear-headed and exercise self-control, and be watchful and diligent in your prayers.

(1 Peter 4:8) 
But above all these things, maintain a fervent and constant divine charity for one another. This is because divine charity—supernatural love—covers a multitude of sins.

(1 Peter 4:9) 
Practice hospitality to one another without grumbling or complaining about the inconvenience.

(1 Peter 4:10) 
Each person, according to the specific divine gift of grace he has received, should use that grace to serve one another. Act as good and faithful stewards of God's varied and multifaceted grace.

(1 Peter 4:11) 
If anyone speaks to the community, he should speak as if delivering the very words of God Himself. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength and spiritual power that God Himself supplies. This is all so that in every action, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him alone belongs all glory and dominion for all ages and eternity. Amen.

(1 Peter 4:12) 
My dearly beloved, do not be surprised or consider it something strange when you experience the fiery trials that come to test your faith. Do not act as if something utterly new or unexpected is happening to you.

(1 Peter 4:13) 
Instead, find joy in the fact that you share in the sufferings of Christ. This is so that when His glory is finally revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding gladness and triumph.

(1 Peter 4:14) 
If you are insulted or reproached for the sake of the name of Christ, then you are truly blessed. For the Spirit of glory, which is the very Spirit of God, rests upon you and dwells within you.

(1 Peter 4:15) 
However, let none of you suffer justly as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody interfering in other people's affairs.

(1 Peter 4:16) 
But if someone suffers for being a Christian, he should not be ashamed of that name. Instead, he should glorify God because he bears that holy name.

(1 Peter 4:17) 
For the appointed time has now come for judgment to begin with the household of God—meaning, with the Church and its members. And if judgment begins first with us, what will be the ultimate end of those who do not believe and obey the Good News of God?

(1 Peter 4:18) 
And if even the righteous person is saved only with great difficulty and by God’s immense mercy, where will the ungodly and the persistent sinner find a place to stand on the Day of Judgment?

(1 Peter 4:19) 
Therefore, let those who suffer according to the providential will of God entrust and commit their souls to Him, their faithful Creator, while continuing to do good and holy works.

(1 Peter 5:1) 
Therefore, I, who am also an elder, appeal to the elders who are among you—
I am a witness of Christ’s sufferings,
and I am a sharer in the glory that will be revealed in the future.

(1 Peter 5:2) 
Shepherd the flock of God that is entrusted to you,
overseeing them not because you are forced to, but willingly, just as God desires.
Do not do it for shameful financial gain, but with eager willingness.

(1 Peter 5:3) 
Do not act as if you are domineering over the people of God,
but rather become genuine examples to the flock, from the heart.

(1 Peter 5:4) 
And when Christ, the Chief Shepherd, appears,
you will certainly receive the unfading crown of glory.

(1 Peter 5:5) 
In the same way, you younger ones, be subject to the elders.
And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility towards one another,
because God resists the proud, but He gives His grace to the humble.

(1 Peter 5:6) 
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,
so that He may exalt you when His time of visitation comes.

(1 Peter 5:7) 
Cast all your anxiety and worries upon Him,
because He cares for you personally.

(1 Peter 5:8) 
Be sober and keep watch:
because your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
seeking someone to devour.

(1 Peter 5:9) 
Resist him, standing firm in your faith,
knowing that the very same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brothers and sisters throughout the entire world.

(1 Peter 5:10) 
But the God of all grace, who has called us into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus,
after you have suffered a little while, He Himself will perfect you,
He will confirm you, He will strengthen you, and He will establish you firmly.

(1 Peter 5:11) 
To Him be glory and dominion for all ages of ages. Amen.

(1 Peter 5:12) 
Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother to you, I have written briefly,
exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you now stand firm.

(1 Peter 5:13) 
The Church, which is in Babylon (Rome), chosen together with you, sends you greetings,
and so does Mark, my spiritual son.

(1 Peter 5:14) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss, a sign of Christian fellowship.
Grace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:1) 
Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to those who have received the same precious faith that we have, which is given by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ Himself.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:2) 
May grace and peace be multiplied to you through your knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:3) 
Since God's divine power has given us everything we need for a life of virtue and holiness,
this comes through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and power.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:4) 
Through these promises, He has granted us His most great and precious gifts.
These gifts enable you to become partakers of the divine nature,
having escaped the corruption of sinful desires that exists in the world.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:5) 
For this very reason, apply all diligence and effort.
To your faith, add virtue.
To virtue, add knowledge.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:6) 
To knowledge, add self-control.
To self-control, add patience.
To patience, add godliness.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:7) 
To godliness, add brotherly love.
And to brotherly love, add the highest form of love: charity.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:8) 
For if these virtues are present in you and are growing in abundance,
they will ensure you are not idle or unfruitful in your knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:9) 
But anyone who lacks these virtues is spiritually blind and shortsighted.
They have forgotten that they were cleansed from their past sins.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:10) 
Therefore, brothers, strive all the more diligently
to confirm your calling and election by performing good works.
For if you do these things, you will never stumble into sin.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:11) 
For in this way, a rich and abundant entrance will be granted to you
into the eternal heavenly kingdom of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:12) 
Because of this, I will always be ready to remind you of these spiritual truths,
even though you already know them and are firmly established in the present truth.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:13) 
Indeed, I consider it right and proper
that as long as I am in this earthly body—my temporary dwelling—
I should stir you up by constantly reminding you of these things.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:14) 
I know that my time for laying aside this earthly body is coming quickly,
just as Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself revealed to me.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:15) 
I will also take every care and do my utmost
so that even after my death, you may often be able to recall these spiritual truths.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:16) 
We did not make known to you the power and the coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ by following cleverly invented stories or myths.
Instead, we were eyewitnesses of His glorious majesty.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:17) 
For He received honor and glory from God the Father
when a voice came to Him from the magnificent glory of God, saying:
"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:18) 
And we ourselves heard this very voice coming forth from the sky,
when we were with Him on the holy mountain during His Transfiguration.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:19) 
And we possess the prophetic word, which is now even more firm and reliable.
You do well to pay attention to it, just as to a lamp shining in a dark and obscure place.
Pay attention to it until the full light of day breaks forth, and Christ, the Morning Star, arises in your hearts.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:20) 
Know this above all else:
no prophecy in Sacred Scripture comes from a prophet’s own private interpretation.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:21) 
For prophecy was never brought forth by human will or intention.
Instead, holy men of God spoke as they were inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:1) 
However, there were also false prophets among God's people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master, Jesus Christ, who bought them and redeemed them, thereby bringing swift and immediate destruction upon themselves.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:2) 
And many will follow their depraved ways and their licentiousness, through whom the way of truth will be slandered and blasphemed.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:3) 
And out of their greed, they will exploit you for profit with their fabricated stories. For them, judgment, decreed long ago, has not been idle; and their destined destruction does not sleep.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:4) 
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, delivering them into chains of gloom and the lowest part of the underworld to be kept for torment until the final judgment,

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:5) 
and if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, along with seven other people, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:6) 
and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by burning them to ashes, making them an example for those who would live ungodly lives in the future;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:7) 
and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the indecent conduct and corrupt lifestyle of lawless men —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:8) 
for that righteous man, as he lived among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:9) 
then the Lord knows how to rescue the devout from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, to be tormented.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:10) 
This is especially true for those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. They are bold and arrogant, and they do not tremble when they slander glorious beings and heavenly majesties.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:11) 
Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:12) 
But these people, like unreasoning animals, are creatures of mere instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed. They slander what they do not understand, and in their own corruption, they will also perish.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:13) 
They will suffer the penalty for their wrongdoing. They consider luxurious living in broad daylight a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:14) 
Their eyes are full of adultery and never stop sinning. They entice unstable souls, and they have hearts trained in greed. They are children of curse and deserving of divine punishment.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:15) 
They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, son of Bosor, who loved the wages of wickedness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:16) 
But he was rebuked for his transgression: a dumb beast of burden, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:17) 
These men are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm. For them, the deepest gloom of darkness is reserved for all eternity.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:18) 
For, by uttering proud words of emptiness and vainglory, they entice, through sensual desires of the flesh and licentiousness, those who are barely escaping from those who live in error and unbelief.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:19) 
They promise them freedom, though they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by whatever a person is overcome, by that he is enslaved.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:20) 
For if, after escaping the pollutions of the world through the saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, their latter state has become worse for them than the former.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:21) 
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:22) 
What happened to them is described by the true proverb: 'A dog returns to its own vomit,' and, 'A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mud and filth.' 

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:1) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, I am writing this second letter to you. In both of these letters, I am stirring up your sincere minds by reminding you of important truths,

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:2) 
so that you may remember the words that the holy prophets foretold and the commandment given by our Lord and Savior through your Apostles.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:3) 
You should know this first and foremost: that in the last days, deceivers will come to mock you. They will live according to their own sinful desires and lead others into deception.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:4) 
They will say, 'Where is the promise of His coming?' They will claim that since our ancestors died, everything has continued exactly as it was from the very beginning of creation, implying that Christ will not return.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:5) 
They willfully ignore the truth that the universe existed before the Flood, and the earth was formed out of water and structured by water through the creative Word of God.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:6) 
And it was by these very waters that the world of that time was utterly destroyed by the great flood.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:7) 
But the present universe and the earth, by the same divine Word, are being preserved. They are reserved for fire on the Day of Judgment, when all ungodly people will be destroyed.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:8) 
However, beloved brothers and sisters, do not let this one thing escape your notice: that with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. This means that God is not limited by our human perception of time.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:9) 
The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some people consider it slowness. Instead, He is patiently waiting because of you. He does not want anyone to perish, but for all to return to repentance and be saved.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:10) 
But the Day of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. On that Day, the heavens—meaning the created universe—will pass away with a tremendous roar, and the basic elements of matter will be dissolved by intense heat. The earth and all its works and structures will be burned up.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:11) 
Since all these things are to be dissolved in such a way, what kind of people ought you to be in holy conduct and acts of piety, preparing yourselves for that Day?

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:12) 
You should be eagerly awaiting and hastening the coming of the Day of the Lord, the Day by which the burning universe will be dissolved, and the basic elements of all matter will melt away in the fervent heat of the fire.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:13) 
But we eagerly await a new universe and a new earth according to His promise—a creation in which perfect righteousness will permanently dwell.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:14) 
Therefore, beloved brothers and sisters, since you are awaiting these glorious things, strive diligently to be found by Him without any moral stain and blameless, living in peace.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:15) 
And consider the long-suffering patience of our Lord to be for your salvation—a truth that our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you, according to the divine wisdom given to him.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:16) 
He speaks of these matters in all his letters. Some things in his letters are difficult to understand, and these difficult passages are twisted and distorted by ignorant and unstable people, just as they distort the other Holy Scriptures, leading to their own eternal destruction.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:17) 
Therefore, beloved brothers, since you have been forewarned of these things, be on your guard so that you may not be led astray by the error of these foolish people and fall from your own steadfastness in the faith.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:18) 
Instead, grow in the grace and in the full, saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be all glory, both now and for the Day of eternity. Amen.

(1 John 1:1) 
The Son of God, who has always existed from the beginning, is the one we personally heard, the one we actually saw with our own eyes, the one we looked at closely, and the one we physically touched with our hands—this is the Son who is the Word of Life.

(1 John 1:2) 
And this divine life was made physically clear to us. We saw it, and we are testifying and proclaiming to you this eternal life—the very life that was eternally with God the Father and then appeared among us.

(1 John 1:3) 
What we saw and heard with our own senses, we now proclaim to you. We do this so that you may share in our spiritual fellowship, and our fellowship is truly with God the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 1:4) 
And we are writing these things to you so that you may have complete and perfect joy.

(1 John 1:5) 
And this is the essential message we heard directly from Him—from Jesus Christ—and which we now proclaim to you: God is pure light, and there is absolutely no darkness or evil within Him.

(1 John 1:6) 
If we claim to have spiritual communion with God, yet we continue to live in sin and error, then we are lying, and we are not living according to God's truth.

(1 John 1:7) 
But if we live according to God's truth—just as He Himself is in pure truth and light—then we truly have spiritual fellowship with each other, and the cleansing sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son, washes away all our sins.

(1 John 1:8) 
If we say that we have no sin, we are only deceiving ourselves, and the truth of God is not truly present within us.

(1 John 1:9) 
If we confess our sins to God, He is faithful to His promises and just in His nature. He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us completely from every unrighteous act.

(1 John 1:10) 
If we claim that we have not sinned, then we are essentially calling God a liar, and His divine message is not genuinely present in our hearts.

(1 John 2:1) 
My dear children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. But even if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is perfectly just. He intercedes for us before God.

(1 John 2:2) 
And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins—meaning His sacrifice atones for and turns away God's just wrath. This is not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world, offering salvation to all who accept it.

(1 John 2:3) 
And by this we know and are sure that we have truly come to know Him, if we keep His commandments and live according to His will.

(1 John 2:4) 
Whoever claims to know Him, yet does not keep His commandments, is a liar. The truth and the reality of faith are not in that person.

(1 John 2:5) 
But whoever keeps His word, truly in that person the love of God is perfected and brought to its full expression. And by this we know that we are abiding in Him.

(1 John 2:6) 
Whoever claims to abide in Christ ought to walk himself, living his life and conducting his affairs, just as Christ walked and lived.

(1 John 2:7) 
Beloved ones, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the very beginning of your faith. This old commandment is the Word of truth which you heard when you first believed.

(1 John 2:8) 
Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true both in Christ Himself and in you, His followers. This is because the spiritual darkness of sin and ignorance has passed away, and the true light of Christ is already shining in the world and in your hearts.

(1 John 2:9) 
Whoever says he is in the light of Christ, yet hates his brother, is in spiritual darkness even until now, despite his claim.

(1 John 2:10) 
Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling or leading others to sin in him.

(1 John 2:11) 
But whoever hates his brother is in darkness and walks blindly in darkness, and he does not know where he is going, because the spiritual darkness of hatred has blinded his eyes.

(1 John 2:12) 
I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven you through the power and authority of His Name, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 2:13) 
I write to you, fathers in faith (those spiritually mature), because you have come to know Him who is from the very beginning, the eternal God. I write to you, young men (those actively engaged in spiritual struggle), because you have overcome the Evil One, Satan.

(1 John 2:14) 
I have written to you, children (new believers), because you have come to know God the Father. I have written to you, fathers in faith, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong in your faith, and the Word of God abides deeply within you, and you have overcome the Evil One.

(1 John 2:15) 
Do not love the world, meaning the fallen and sinful system of human society that is opposed to God, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world in this way, the love of God the Father is not in him.

(1 John 2:16) 
For everything that is in the world—that is, the temptations and values of this fallen system—is the disordered desire of the flesh (sensual cravings), and the disordered desire of the eyes (covetousness and lustful looking), and the pride of life (arrogance and self-glory). These desires are not from the Father, but originate from the world.

(1 John 2:17) 
And the world, with all its fleeting glory and sinful desires, is passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains eternally, possessing true and lasting life.

(1 John 2:18) 
Dear children, it is the final hour of this present age, the time between Christ's first and second comings. And just as you heard that *the* Antichrist, the ultimate adversary of Christ, is coming, even now many antichrists—those who oppose Christ—have appeared. From this fact, we know that it is the final hour.

(1 John 2:19) 
These antichrists went out from among us, meaning they were once part of the Christian community, but they were not truly of us in genuine faith. For if they had been truly of us, they would have remained with us. But they left so that it might be made manifest and clear that they are not truly of us.

(1 John 2:20) 
But you, believers, have an anointing from the Holy One—that is, from Christ or through the Holy Spirit—and you know all necessary truths for salvation and discernment.

(1 John 2:21) 
I have not written to you as if you are ignorant of the truth, but as those who already know it. And I write because it is clear that no lie can ever come from the truth; they are fundamentally opposed.

(1 John 2:22) 
Who is the liar, if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ, the Anointed Messiah? This person is an antichrist, one who denies the Father and the Son, thereby rejecting the very nature of God and salvation.

(1 John 2:23) 
Everyone who denies the Son does not also have the Father; you cannot truly know or relate to God the Father without accepting Jesus as His Son. And whoever confesses the Son also has the Father.

(1 John 2:24) 
Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning, the foundational teachings of the faith, remain firmly established in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you also will remain in the Son and in the Father, experiencing intimate communion with the Trinity.

(1 John 2:25) 
And this is the promise which He Himself promised to us, the ultimate gift of eternal life.

(1 John 2:26) 
I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to lead you astray with false teachings.

(1 John 2:27) 
But as for you, the anointing which you received from Him (the indwelling Holy Spirit) let it remain in you. And you do not necessarily need anyone to teach you *everything* in the way of ultimate truth, but just as His anointing teaches you about all things pertaining to salvation and discernment—and this teaching is true and is not a lie—just as it has taught you, abide in Him, remaining steadfast in Christ.

(1 John 2:28) 
And now, dear children, abide in Him, remain firmly united to Christ. Do this so that when He appears in His glorious Second Coming, we may have confidence and not be put to shame or shrink away from Him at His arrival.

(1 John 2:29) 
If you know that He, God Himself, is just and righteous, then know also that everyone who practices righteousness, living in a way that aligns with God's justice, is born of Him, having received a new spiritual birth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:1) 
Consider what great love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and truly are His children! Because of this spiritual reality, the world does not understand us, because it never truly understood God the Father or His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:2) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, we are already children of God right now! Yet, it has not yet been fully revealed what our glorified state will be. But we do know this: when He—Jesus Christ—appears again in glory, we shall be made like Him, for we shall see Him as He truly is.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:3) 
And everyone who cherishes this hope in Him—in Jesus Christ and His glorious return—purifies himself, just as Christ Himself is perfectly pure.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:4) 
Everyone who commits sin also breaks God’s law, and sin, by its very nature, is a transgression of that divine law.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:5) 
And you know that Jesus Christ appeared to take away our sins, and there is absolutely no sin found in Him.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:6) 
Everyone who truly abides in Him—in Christ—does not continue to live in sin. And everyone who habitually sins has not genuinely seen Him nor truly known Him in a saving way.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:7) 
My dear children, do not let anyone deceive you about this: the one who practices righteousness and lives according to God’s law is righteous, just as Jesus Christ Himself is righteous.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:8) 
The one who habitually practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning since the very beginning of creation. It was for this specific reason that God the Son appeared: to undo and destroy the works of the devil.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:9) 
No one who has been truly born of God continually practices sin, because God's divine life, like a spiritual seed, remains within him. And such a person cannot habitually sin as a lifestyle, because he has been born of God and has a new spiritual nature.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:10) 
By this clear distinction, the children of God and the children of the devil are made evident. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not from God. And likewise, anyone who does not love his Christian brother or sister is not from God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:11) 
For this is the fundamental message that you have heard from the very beginning of your Christian faith: that we should love one another.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:12) 
Do not be like Cain, who was spiritually aligned with the evil one, and murdered his own brother. And why did he murder him? Because Cain’s own deeds were wicked, while his brother Abel’s deeds were righteous in God's sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:13) 
Therefore, do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the ungodly world hates you.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:14) 
We, the faithful, know with certainty that we have passed from spiritual death into spiritual life, because we love our Christian brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains spiritually dead.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:15) 
Everyone who hates his Christian brother or sister is, in God’s sight, a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding within himself.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:16) 
By this supreme act, we have come to understand the depth of God’s love: that He—Jesus Christ—laid down His own life for us. Therefore, we also ought to be willing to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:17) 
But if someone possesses the material resources of this world, and sees his Christian brother or sister in need, yet closes his heart and refuses to help him, how can the love of God truly abide in that person?

(1 John 3:1 John 3:18) 
My dear children, let us not love merely in word or with empty talk, but genuinely, through our actions and with sincere truth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:19) 
By this practical love, we know that we are truly from the truth, and thus we can reassure our hearts before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:20) 
Because even if our own conscience condemns us, remember that God is greater than our heart and knows all things, including our intentions and efforts, offering mercy.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:21) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confident assurance before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:22) 
And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we diligently keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:23) 
And this is His foundational commandment: that we believe in the saving name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, just as He commanded us to do.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:24) 
And the one who keeps His commandments remains in God, and God remains in him. And by this we know that God remains in us: by the Holy Spirit whom He has given to us.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:1) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, do not believe every spiritual influence or teaching you encounter, but instead discern whether these spirits and their teachings are truly from God. Many false prophets have emerged and spread throughout the world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:2) 
This is how you can recognize the true Spirit of God: every spiritual teaching that acknowledges Jesus Christ has come into the world as a fully human being, with a real body, truly originates from God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:3) 
And any spiritual teaching that denies the truth about Jesus Christ—specifically that He is truly human and truly divine—does not originate from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have been warned would come, and indeed, it is already at work in the world today.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:4) 
My dear little children, you are from God and have already defeated the spirit of the antichrist and the world's false teachings. This is because the Holy Spirit who lives within you is infinitely greater than the evil spirit who dominates this world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:5) 
Those false prophets and their teachings originate from the world itself. Therefore, their messages are worldly in nature, and the worldly people readily accept and listen to them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:6) 
We, the true apostles and teachers, are from God. Anyone who truly knows and loves God listens to and accepts our teachings. Anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is the clear way we distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:7) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, let us continually love one another, because true, self-sacrificing love originates directly from God. Every person who genuinely loves in this way has been spiritually reborn by God and truly knows Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:8) 
Anyone who does not practice this kind of love does not truly know God, for the very essence and nature of God is love itself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:9) 
In this one supreme act, the immense love of God was made manifest to us: God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, not just for a visit, but so that we might gain spiritual and eternal life through Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:10) 
Real love is found in this: it was not that we first loved God, but rather that He loved us first. And because of this profound love, He sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins, to appease His righteous anger and reconcile us to Himself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:11) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, if God has loved us with such immense love, then we, too, are obligated to love one another in the same sacrificial way.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:12) 
No human being has ever seen God with their physical eyes. However, if we consistently love one another, then God dwells within us, and His love, fully actualized and made complete, is perfected in us through our actions.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:13) 
This is how we come to know with certainty that we remain united with God, and that He remains united with us: because He has graciously given us His Holy Spirit.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:14) 
And we, the apostles, have personally seen Him and bear witness to the truth that God the Father sent His Son as the one and only Savior of the entire world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:15) 
Whoever openly declares and believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly has God dwelling within them, and they, in turn, dwell in God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:16) 
And we ourselves have come to know, through experience and faith, the profound love that God has for us. God Himself is love. Therefore, anyone who lives and remains in this true love also lives and remains in God, and God lives and remains in them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:17) 
In this way, God's love is made perfect and complete in us: we can have unwavering confidence on the Day of Judgment. This is because, as Jesus Christ is in His divine and human nature, so also are we, through Him, made to be in this world—righteous and beloved by God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:18) 
There is no room for cringing fear in divine love. Instead, perfect and mature love expels all such fear, because fear inherently involves the expectation of punishment. Anyone who still lives in this kind of fear has not yet been made perfect and complete in their understanding and practice of divine love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:19) 
Therefore, let us eagerly love God, because He first loved us with an initiating and boundless love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:20) 
If someone claims, "I love God," yet at the same time harbors hatred for his brother or sister in Christ, that person is a liar. For how can anyone truly love God, whom they have not seen, if they do not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen and interact with daily?

(1 John 4:1 John 4:21) 
And indeed, this is the explicit commandment we have received from God Himself: that whoever loves God must also love his brother or sister in Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:1) 
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Christ, has been spiritually born of God. And everyone who loves the Father, who is the source of this new birth, also loves all others who are born of Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:2) 
By this sign we know that we truly love the children of God: when we love God ourselves and obey His commandments.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:3) 
For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome or impossible to keep.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:4) 
For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world: our faith in Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:5) 
Who is it, then, who overcomes the world? It is only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly God from God.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:6) 
This is Jesus Christ, who came to us through the waters of Baptism and the shedding of His blood on the Cross. He did not come to us by water alone, but by water and blood together. And it is the Holy Spirit who bears witness that Christ is the Truth Himself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:7) 
For there are three witnesses who bear testimony in Heaven: the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And these three are one in their divine essence and nature.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:8) 
And there are three witnesses who bear testimony on earth: the Holy Spirit, the water of Baptism, and the blood of the Eucharist and His Passion. And these three also bear a unified witness.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:9) 
If we accept the testimony of men in earthly courts, the testimony of God is far greater and more authoritative. For this is God’s testimony, which is the greater, because He Himself has borne witness concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:10) 
Whoever believes in God the Son carries the testimony of God within himself, imprinted upon his soul. Whoever does not believe in God the Son makes God out to be a liar and rejects His divine truth, because he does not believe the testimony that God Himself has borne concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:11) 
And this is the central truth of that testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this eternal life is found fully in His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:12) 
Whoever possesses God the Son, through faith and grace, also possesses this eternal life. Whoever does not possess God the Son does not have this eternal life, for it can only be found in Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:13) 
I am writing these things to you so that you may know with certainty that you possess eternal life, you who believe in the Name of God the Son, which is Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:14) 
And this is the confident assurance that we have in Him, God Himself: that if we ask anything according to His divine will, He hears and grants our prayer.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:15) 
And since we know that He hears us in whatever we ask in accordance with His will, we also know that we have already been granted the petitions we have asked from Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:16) 
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to spiritual death, he should pray for him, and God will grant life to that sinner who has not sinned unto death. There is, however, a sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin. I do not say that one should pray for that kind of sin in the same way, as it requires deeper repentance.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:17) 
Every unrighteous act is a sin against God. But there is a specific type of sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:18) 
We know that everyone who has been born of God does not habitually or mortally sin, for the Son of God Himself, being truly born of God, keeps Himself free from sin, and the Evil One cannot grasp Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:19) 
We know that we are truly from God, yet the whole world around us lies under the power and influence of the Evil One.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:20) 
And we know with certainty that God the Son has come into the world, and He has given us the spiritual understanding to know the true God, so that we may truly be united with His true Son, Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the true God, and He is eternal life itself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:21) 
Little children, guard yourselves from idols and false gods. Amen.

(2 John 1:1) 
The Elder writes this letter to the chosen Lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not only I, but also all those who have come to know the truth of Christ.

(2 John 1:2) 
This is because the truth of Christ dwells in us, and will be with us eternally.

(2 John 1:3) 
May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.

(2 John 1:4) 
I rejoiced greatly when I found some of your children living according to the truth, just as we received a commandment to do from God the Father.

(2 John 1:5) 
And now I ask you, Lady, not as though I am writing a new commandment for you, but that which we have had from the very beginning: that we love one another.

(2 John 1:6) 
And this is true love: that we live according to His commandments. This is the commandment that you have heard from the beginning of your faith: that you should live by it.

(2 John 1:7) 
Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has truly come in human flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist, denying the reality of the Incarnation.

(2 John 1:8) 
Watch yourselves carefully, so that you do not lose the spiritual fruits you have worked for. Instead, remain faithful, so that you may receive a full and complete reward.

(2 John 1:9) 
Everyone who goes astray and does not remain in the true teaching of Christ does not have God with them. But whoever remains in the true doctrine of Christ, that person has both God the Father and God the Son.

(2 John 1:10) 
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this true doctrine of Christ, do not receive him into your house, nor offer him any greeting of welcome, for that would be to share in his evil work.

(2 John 1:11) 
For anyone who offers him a greeting of welcome, thereby shares in his evil works and aids his mission.

(2 John 1:12) 
Although I have many more things to write to you, I did not wish to communicate them through paper and ink. For I hope to be with you soon, and to speak to you face to face, so that our joy may be full.

(2 John 1:13) 
The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. Amen.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:1) 
The Elder writes this letter to Gaius, my dearest spiritual child, whom I love in the fullness of the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:2) 
My dearest, I always pray for your complete well-being, that you may prosper in every aspect of your life and be in good health, just as your soul prospers in grace.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:3) 
I was overjoyed when our brothers in Christ came and bore witness to the fidelity of your life to the Truth, confirming that you indeed live according to the Truth of the Gospel.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:4) 
I have no greater spiritual joy than to hear that my spiritual children are living faithfully according to the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:5) 
My dearest, you act with true fidelity in everything you do for our fellow Christians, and especially for those who are traveling missionaries.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:6) 
These very brothers have given public testimony to your selfless charity before the entire Church. You will do a good work to send them forth on their journey in a manner truly worthy of God's holy service.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:7) 
For they have gone forth on their mission for the sake of His holy Name, relying only on the faithful, accepting no material support from those who are not believers in Christ.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:8) 
Therefore, we who believe ought to provide for and welcome such faithful missionaries, so that by our support, we may become their fellow laborers in the mission of the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:9) 
I also wrote a letter to the Church there; however, Diotrephes, who loves to be the supreme authority among them, openly rejects our apostolic authority and guidance.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:10) 
Because of this open defiance, if I come to visit, I will call attention to his wicked deeds: how he spreads malicious gossip against us with his words. And not content with merely doing this, he himself refuses to welcome the faithful traveling missionaries. Furthermore, he forbids those who desire to welcome them, and even casts them out of the Church community.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:11) 
My dearest, do not imitate what is evil, but rather embrace what is truly good. He who consistently does good and acts righteously is a child of God. But he who consistently does evil and acts wrongly has not truly known God.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:12) 
Regarding Demetrius, everyone speaks well of him, and his very life itself gives testimony to the Truth. We also bear our own witness to him, and you know well that our testimony concerning him is undeniably true.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:13) 
I had many more things to communicate to you, but I chose not to commit them to writing with mere ink and pen.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:14) 
Instead, I eagerly hope to see you very soon, so that we may speak to one another face to face. May peace be with you always.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:15) 
All the faithful here send their greetings to you. Please, in turn, greet all our beloved friends in the faith there, personally by name.

(Jude 1:1) 
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, writes to those who are loved by God the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ, and called to His purpose.

(Jude 1:2) 
May mercy, peace, and divine love be abundantly multiplied to you.

(Jude 1:3) 
Beloved, I was diligently preparing to write to you about our common salvation, but I felt it was necessary to write and urge you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once and for all delivered to the saints.

(Jude 1:4) 
For certain godless men have secretly slipped in among you—men long ago marked out for this condemnation—who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness, denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:5) 
Now I want to remind you, even though you once understood all these things, that the Lord, after saving His people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those who did not believe.

(Jude 1:6) 
And the angels who did not keep their proper domain but abandoned their own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.

(Jude 1:7) 
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, in a similar manner, indulged in gross sexual immorality and went after unnatural lust, they serve as an example, undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

(Jude 1:8) 
Likewise, these dreamers—the false teachers—defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the divine majesty of God and His angels.

(Jude 1:9) 
Yet Archangel Michael, when contending with the devil and disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce a reviling judgment against him, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

(Jude 1:10) 
But these men blaspheme all that they do not understand, and what they know instinctively by natural instinct, like unreasoning animals, these things only corrupt them.

(Jude 1:11) 
Woe to them! For they have walked in the path of Cain, and for profit they have plunged headlong into the error of Balaam, and they have perished in the rebellion of Korah.

(Jude 1:12) 
These men are hidden reefs and blemishes at your sacred love feasts, feasting with you without fear, caring only for themselves. They are like clouds without water, carried along by winds; they are autumn trees without fruit, twice dead and completely uprooted.

(Jude 1:13) 
They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; they are wandering stars for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

(Jude 1:14) 
It was also about these very men that Enoch, the seventh in line from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of His holy ones, the angels and saints, to execute judgment,"

(Jude 1:15) 
...to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of their ungodly acts which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.

(Jude 1:16) 
These men are grumblers, faultfinders, following their own evil desires. Their mouths utter arrogant boasts, and they flatter people for the sake of personal gain.

(Jude 1:17) 
But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken beforehand by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:18) 
For they used to say to you that in the last times there will be scoffers, who will walk according to their own ungodly desires.

(Jude 1:19) 
These are the ones who cause divisions and separate themselves, being merely natural men, not possessing the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:20) 
But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:21) 
Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which leads to eternal life.

(Jude 1:22) 
And for some, those who are already clearly in error, bring them to account and reprove them sharply;

(Jude 1:23) 
...but others, snatch out of the fire and save them; and on others, have mercy, but with caution, hating even the clothes that have been stained by their sinful flesh.

(Jude 1:24) 
Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless, with exceeding joy, before the presence of His glory—

(Jude 1:25) 
...to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and for all ages. Amen.

(Revelation 1:1) 
This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God the Father gave to God the Son, so that He could make known to His servants what must quickly happen. And God the Son made it known by sending His Angel to His servant John.

(Revelation 1:2) 
John bore witness to the Word of God—the Son, Jesus Christ—and to everything he saw.

(Revelation 1:3) 
Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things written in it. For the time is near for these things to unfold.

(Revelation 1:4) 
John writes to the seven churches that are in Asia. May grace and peace be with you from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Eternal Father, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.

(Revelation 1:5) 
And may grace and peace be with you from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful Witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. He loved us and washed us from our sins in His own Blood.

(Revelation 1:6) 
And He made us a kingdom of priests for God, His Father. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

(Revelation 1:7) 
Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him—even those who pierced Him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. Yes, truly, Amen.

(Revelation 1:8) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the Beginning and the End—the One who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Almighty."

(Revelation 1:9) 
I, John, your brother and companion in the tribulation, and in the kingdom, and in the patient endurance of Jesus Christ, was on the island called Patmos because of the Word of God—the Son, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.

(Revelation 1:10) 
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the sound of a trumpet.

(Revelation 1:11) 
The voice said: "Write what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches that are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."

(Revelation 1:12) 
I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.

(Revelation 1:13) 
And in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to His feet, and girded at the chest with a golden sash.

(Revelation 1:14) 
His head and His hair were white, like white wool or like snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire.

(Revelation 1:15) 
His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters—a mighty roar.

(Revelation 1:16) 
He held seven stars in His right hand. From His mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and His face shone like the sun in its full strength.

(Revelation 1:17) 
When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand upon me, saying: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last."

(Revelation 1:18) 
"I am the Living One. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys of death and of hell."

(Revelation 1:19) 
"Therefore, write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these."

(Revelation 1:20) 
"The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands is this: the seven stars are the Angels—the spiritual guardians—of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches themselves."

(Revelation 2:2:1) 
Write to the angel of the Church at Ephesus. Here are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand—the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, which are the seven Churches.

(Revelation 2:2:2) 
I know all that you do. I know your hard work and your patient endurance. And I know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who falsely claim to be apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.

(Revelation 2:2:3) 
You have also persevered patiently, and you have endured hardship for My Name’s sake without growing weary or giving up.

(Revelation 2:2:4) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: you have abandoned the fervent love you had for Me at first.

(Revelation 2:2:5) 
Remember the spiritual heights from which you have fallen. Repent and return to doing the good works you did at the beginning of your faith. If you do not repent and change your ways, I will come to you swiftly and remove your lampstand from its place, meaning your Church itself could lose its existence or purpose.

(Revelation 2:2:6) 
But I do commend you for this: you utterly hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

(Revelation 2:2:7) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will grant the right to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the paradise of My God.

(Revelation 2:2:8) 
And to the angel of the Church at Smyrna, write these words: Here are the words of the First and the Last, who was dead and now lives.

(Revelation 2:2:9) 
I know your suffering and persecution, and I know your material poverty. But you are spiritually rich. I also know the slander and blasphemies from those who claim to be Jews but are not truly God’s people. Instead, they are a synagogue of Satan.

(Revelation 2:2:10) 
Do not be afraid of any of the suffering you are about to face. Listen! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested and tried. And you will suffer for a limited period of ten days. Remain faithful and steadfast, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of eternal life.

(Revelation 2:2:11) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. The one who overcomes and remains faithful will not be harmed by the second death.

(Revelation 2:2:12) 
And to the angel of the Church at Pergamum, write these words: Here are the words of the One who has the sharp, two-edged sword.

(Revelation 2:2:13) 
I know where you live, in the very city where Satan’s throne is located. Yet, you hold fast to My Name and have not denied your faith in Me. Even in those difficult days, when Antipas, My faithful witness, was martyred among you, right there where Satan dwells.

(Revelation 2:2:14) 
Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You tolerate some among you who cling to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites into sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.

(Revelation 2:2:15) 
Similarly, you also have those who cling to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

(Revelation 2:2:16) 
Therefore, repent of these things and change your ways. Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and I will wage war against them with the sword of My mouth.

(Revelation 2:2:17) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will give some of the hidden manna to eat, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and eternal life. I will also give that person a white stone, a symbol of acquittal and honor, and on that stone, a new name will be written, which no one knows except the one who receives it, signifying a unique relationship with Me.

(Revelation 2:2:18) 
And to the angel of the Church at Thyatira, write these words: Here are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze, glowing as if refined in a furnace.

(Revelation 2:2:19) 
I know all that you do. I know your faith, your love, your service to others, and your patient endurance. Indeed, your more recent works are even greater than those you did at first.

(Revelation 2:2:20) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and through her teaching, she misleads My servants into committing sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols.

(Revelation 2:2:21) 
I gave her time to repent and change her ways, but she refuses to repent of her immoral behavior.

(Revelation 2:2:22) 
Listen! I will cast her onto a bed of suffering and sickness. And those who commit adultery with her will be plunged into intense suffering and great tribulation, unless they repent of the evil works they learned from her.

(Revelation 2:2:23) 
I will also strike her followers with death. Then all the Churches will know that I am the One who searches the innermost thoughts and desires, as well as the intentions of the heart. And I will give to each one of you exactly what your works deserve.

(Revelation 2:2:24) 
But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to all who do not hold to this false teaching, and who have not learned what some call the 'deep secrets' of Satan—I tell you: I will not lay any other burden upon you.

(Revelation 2:2:25) 
Only hold firmly to the truth you already have until I come again.

(Revelation 2:2:26) 
To the one who overcomes and remains faithful to My works until the very end, I will give that person authority over the nations.

(Revelation 2:2:27) 
That person will rule them with a rod of iron, and they will be shattered like earthenware vessels.

(Revelation 2:2:28) 
—just as I Myself have received this authority from My Father. And I will also give that person the Morning Star, which is Myself, symbolizing a share in My glory and rule.

(Revelation 2:2:29) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.

(Revelation 3:3:1) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Sardis, write these words: 'These are the words of Him who possesses the seven Spirits of God—that is, the Holy Spirit in all His fullness—and the seven stars, who are the bishops of the Churches. I know all your deeds. You have the reputation among men of being spiritually alive, but in reality, you are spiritually dead.'

(Revelation 3:3:2) 
'Wake up and be watchful! And strengthen the remaining good that is still alive within you, for it is on the verge of dying completely. For I have not found your deeds to be complete or perfect in the eyes of My God.'

(Revelation 3:3:3) 
'Therefore, remember the pure teaching you received from the Apostles and how you first heard it. Hold fast to it, and repent of your spiritual slumber. If you do not wake up and remain watchful, I will come upon you suddenly, like a thief in the night, and you will not know the hour of My coming to judge you.'

(Revelation 3:3:4) 
'But there are a few people in Sardis who have not stained their garments with sin. These few will walk with Me in white robes, for they are worthy of this honor, having kept their purity.'

(Revelation 3:3:5) 
'The one who overcomes these spiritual trials will similarly be clothed in white garments, signifying their purity and victory. I will certainly not erase their name from the Book of Life, which records those who are destined for eternal salvation. And I will publicly acknowledge and declare their name before My Father and before His holy angels.'

(Revelation 3:3:6) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:7) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Philadelphia, write these words: 'These are the words of the Holy One, who is absolutely true, and who holds the key of David—the ultimate authority over the Kingdom of God, the Church. What He opens, no one can shut; and what He shuts, no one can open, for He has absolute power over all things.'

(Revelation 3:3:8) 
'I know all your deeds. Behold, I have placed before you an open door for ministry and evangelism, and no one has the power to shut it. I have done this because you possess little worldly strength, yet you have kept My word faithfully and have never denied My name.'

(Revelation 3:3:9) 
'Behold, I will deliver into your hands those from the synagogue of Satan—those who falsely claim to be true Jews, God's chosen people, but are liars. Behold, I will make them come and prostrate themselves before your feet, showing their submission to you. This will happen so that they will know that I, Jesus Christ, have truly loved you.'

(Revelation 3:3:10) 
'Because you have faithfully kept My command to endure with patience, I, in turn, will keep you safe during the coming hour of temptation—a time of severe trial which is about to come upon the entire world to test all who dwell on the earth.'

(Revelation 3:3:11) 
'Behold, I am coming soon! Hold fast to the faith and good works you possess, so that no one may take away the crown of eternal life and glory that awaits you.'

(Revelation 3:3:12) 
'The one who overcomes will I make a steadfast pillar in the eternal temple of My God, and they shall never again have to leave it. I will inscribe upon them the very name of My God, and the name of the city of My God—the New Jerusalem, which descends from the sky, from My God Himself—and also My own new name. This signifies their permanent place, their divine ownership, and their intimate communion.'

(Revelation 3:3:13) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:14) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Laodicea, write these words: 'These are the words of the Amen—that is, the Divine Truth Himself—the faithful and true witness to God's plan, who is the source and ruler of all God's creation, not a created being Himself.'

(Revelation 3:3:15) 
'I know all your deeds, and you are neither spiritually cold nor spiritually hot. Oh, how I wish you were either truly cold, openly rejecting Me, or truly hot, fervently zealous for Me!'

(Revelation 3:3:16) 
'But because you are lukewarm—neither truly cold nor truly hot—just like the nauseating, tepid water, I am about to spit you out of My mouth.'

(Revelation 3:3:17) 
'Because you boastfully declare, "I am rich and have acquired great wealth, and I am in need of nothing!"—yet you do not realize that in My sight, you are truly wretched, pitiable, spiritually poor, blind to truth, and naked of spiritual virtue.'

(Revelation 3:3:18) 
'Therefore, I advise you to come and 'buy' from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may become truly rich in faith and good works. Also, 'buy' white garments from Me, so that you may clothe yourself and cover the shameful nakedness of your sins. And 'buy' eye salve from Me, to anoint your eyes so that you may regain your spiritual sight and truly understand.'

(Revelation 3:3:19) 
'All those whom I truly love, I rebuke and discipline for their own good. Therefore, be zealous in your faith and promptly repent of your lukewarmness.'

(Revelation 3:3:20) 
'Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door to Me, I will come in to them, and I will share a meal with them in intimate communion, and they with Me.'

(Revelation 3:3:21) 
'The one who overcomes will I grant the privilege to sit with Me on My throne, sharing in My royal authority—just as I Myself overcame the world and then sat down with My Father on His throne.'

(Revelation 3:3:22) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:1) 
After these events, I looked, and behold, a door stood open in Heaven. Then I heard the first voice I had heard before—a voice like a trumpet speaking to me. It said, "Come up here! And I will show you what must happen after these things."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:2) 
Immediately, I was transported in spirit, and behold, there was a throne set in Heaven, and upon the throne, Someone was seated.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:3) 
The One seated there looked like jasper and sardine stones. And around the throne, there was a rainbow, looking like an emerald.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:4) 
Around that throne were twenty-four smaller thrones, and on these twenty-four thrones sat twenty-four elders. They were clothed in white robes, and on their heads were crowns of gold.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:5) 
From the throne came flashes of lightning, voices, and peals of thunder. And seven burning lamps were before the throne, which represent the seven Spirits of God—the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:6) 
And before the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. And in the center of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:7) 
The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like that of a man. And the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:8) 
Each of the four living creatures had six wings. They were full of eyes all around and within. They never ceased, day or night, saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, He who was, and who is, and who is to come."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:9) 
And whenever those living creatures gave glory, and honor, and blessing to the One seated on the throne—to Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever—

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:10) 
the twenty-four elders would fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, declaring:

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:11) 
"You are worthy, Our Lord and Our God, to receive glory, and honor, and power. Because You created all things, and by Your will, they existed and were created."

(Revelation 5:1) 
And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne a scroll. This scroll was written on both its inner and outer surfaces, and it was sealed with seven seals.

(Revelation 5:2) 
And I saw a mighty angel. He was proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open this scroll and break its seals?"

(Revelation 5:3) 
And no one in the universe, nor on the earth, nor in the underworld, was able to open the scroll or even to look at it.

(Revelation 5:4) 
And I began to weep profusely because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or even to examine it.

(Revelation 5:5) 
And one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah—the promised descendant of David who is the Root and source of David's royal line—He has conquered. He is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seven seals."

(Revelation 5:6) 
And I looked, and behold, in the center, between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb. This Lamb appeared as if it had been slain, bearing the marks of sacrifice. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven Spirits of God sent throughout the entire earth.

(Revelation 5:7) 
And the Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne.

(Revelation 5:8) 
And when the Lamb was about to open the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before Him. Each of them had a harp and a golden bowl full of incense; these bowls contain the prayers of the saints.

(Revelation 5:9) 
And they sang a new song, declaring, "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive the scroll and to open its seals. For you were slain, and by your precious blood, you have ransomed us for God—rescuing people from every tribe, language, nation, and people group."

(Revelation 5:10) 
You have made us into a kingdom and priests for our God, and we shall reign over the earth.

(Revelation 5:11) 
And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels encircling the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. Their number was countless—millions upon millions.

(Revelation 5:12) 
They were saying with a loud voice, "The Lamb who was slain is worthy to receive all power, and divine authority, and perfect wisdom, and immense strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!"

(Revelation 5:13) 
And I heard every creature in the entire universe—those in the sky, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea—every single one of them, saying: "To Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion forever and ever!"

(Revelation 5:14) 
And the four living creatures were saying, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down on their faces and adored Him who lives forever and ever.

(Revelation 6:1) 
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures speak with a voice like thunder, saying: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:2) 
And I looked, and behold, a white horse appeared. He who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went forth conquering, and to conquer all things.

(Revelation 6:3) 
And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:4) 
And another horse went out, a red one. It was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that people would kill one another. A great sword was also given to him.

(Revelation 6:5) 
And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come, and see.” And behold, a black horse appeared, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.

(Revelation 6:6) 
And I heard a voice, as it were, from the midst of the four living creatures, saying: “A measure of wheat will cost a denarius, and three measures of barley will cost a denarius, but do not harm the wine and the oil.”

(Revelation 6:7) 
And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:8) 
And behold, a pale horse appeared, and he who sat upon it was named Death, and the realm of the dead followed closely with him. Power was given to him over a fourth part of the earth, to kill by the sword, and by famine, and by plagues, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

(Revelation 6:9) 
And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony of faith they had always held.

(Revelation 6:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: “How long, O holy and true Lord, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who live on the earth?”

(Revelation 6:11) 
And white robes were given to each of them, and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and their brethren are complete—those who are also to be killed, just as they were.

(Revelation 6:12) 
And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal, and behold, a great earthquake happened, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the entire moon became like blood.

(Revelation 6:13) 
And the stars from the sky fell upon the earth, just as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.

(Revelation 6:14) 
And the sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

(Revelation 6:15) 
And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the military commanders, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave and every free person hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

(Revelation 6:16) 
And they said to the mountains and to the rocks: “Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.”

(Revelation 6:17) 
For the great day of their wrath has come, and who will be able to stand against it?”

(Revelation 7:7:1) 
After these visions, I saw four Angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.

(Revelation 7:7:2) 
Then I saw another Angel coming up from the direction of the rising sun. This Angel had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four Angels who had been given the power to harm the earth and the sea.

(Revelation 7:7:3) 
He told them: "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God."

(Revelation 7:7:4) 
And I heard the total number of those who were sealed: 144,000 people were sealed, from every tribe of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 7:7:5) 
From the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Gad, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:6) 
From the tribe of Asher, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:7) 
From the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Levi, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Issachar, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:8) 
From the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:9) 
After these things, I saw a great multitude that no one could count. They came from every nation, and from all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They were standing before the throne of God and in the presence of the Lamb of God, clothed in shining white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.

(Revelation 7:7:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation comes from our God, who sits upon the throne, and from the Lamb!"

(Revelation 7:7:11) 
And all the Angels were standing around the throne, and around the Elders, and the four living creatures. They all fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God.

(Revelation 7:7:12) 
saying: "Amen! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, and power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"

(Revelation 7:7:13) 
Then one of the Elders spoke to me, asking: "Who are these people who are clothed in shining white robes? And where did they come from?"

(Revelation 7:7:14) 
And I said to him: "My Lord, you are the one who knows." And he said to me: "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white by the blood of the Lamb."

(Revelation 7:7:15) 
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple. And the One who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle of protection over them.

(Revelation 7:7:16) 
They will never be hungry again, and they will never be thirsty again. Neither will the sun beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.

(Revelation 7:7:17) 
For the Lamb, who is at the very center of the throne, will be their Shepherd. He will lead them to the springs of the waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

(Revelation 8:8:1) 
And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was a solemn silence in the spiritual realm of heaven, lasting for about half an hour.

(Revelation 8:8:2) 
I then saw seven angels standing before the very presence of God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

(Revelation 8:8:3) 
Another angel then came and stood before the heavenly altar, holding a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it along with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that stands before God’s throne.

(Revelation 8:8:4) 
And the smoke of the incense, carrying the prayers of God's holy people, ascended from the angel's hand into the presence of God.

(Revelation 8:8:5) 
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw the fire down onto the earth. At once, there were great peals of thunder, roaring voices, flashes of lightning, and a mighty earthquake.

(Revelation 8:8:6) 
And the seven angels, who held the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to blow them.

(Revelation 8:8:7) 
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, which was then cast down onto the earth. As a result, one-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was completely consumed by fire.

(Revelation 8:8:8) 
Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a massive mountain, blazing with fire, was hurled into the sea. One-third of the sea then turned into blood.

(Revelation 8:8:9) 
One-third of all the living creatures in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships were destroyed.

(Revelation 8:8:10) 
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, burning like a blazing torch, fell from the sky. It landed upon one-third of the rivers and the springs of water.

(Revelation 8:8:11) 
The name of the star is called "Wormwood," referring to its bitter effect. And one-third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood, and many people died from drinking these waters because they had become so bitter.

(Revelation 8:8:12) 
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars. Consequently, one-third of their light was darkened, so that one-third of the day had no light, and similarly, one-third of the night was also dark.

(Revelation 8:8:13) 
I then looked and heard an eagle flying in the middle of the sky, crying out with a loud voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts of the three angels who are still about to sound their trumpets!"

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:1) 
The fifth angel then blew his trumpet. I then saw a star—a heavenly being—fall from the sky and land on the earth. This fallen star was given a key to unlock the bottomless pit of the abyss.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:2) 
He opened the bottomless pit, and a vast amount of smoke rose from the pit, like the smoke from a massive furnace. The sun and the very air itself were both darkened by this smoke that came from the pit.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:3) 
Then, from the smoke, swarms of these locust-like creatures emerged and spread across the earth. They were given a destructive power, similar to the power that earthly scorpions have when they sting.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:4) 
They were explicitly commanded not to harm any vegetation—not the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree. Their only target was to be those people who did not have the mark of God on their foreheads.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:5) 
These creatures were not allowed to kill their victims. Instead, they were permitted to inflict torment upon them for a period of five months. The pain they caused was as severe as the excruciating pain a person feels when stung by a scorpion.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:6) 
During that time of suffering, people will desperately search for death, yet they will not be able to find it. They will long to die, but death itself will evade them and keep them alive to suffer.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:7) 
The appearance of these locust-like creatures was like horses equipped for battle. On their heads, they seemed to wear something like crowns made of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:8) 
They had hair that looked like women's hair, and their teeth were as sharp and strong as the teeth of lions.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:9) 
They were protected by breastplates that seemed to be made of iron. The sound of their wings was as deafening as the noise of many chariots pulled by numerous horses charging into battle.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:10) 
These creatures possessed tails similar to those of scorpions, and their tails contained deadly stings. Their power to inflict harm on people was limited to five months.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:11) 
These creatures had a king ruling over them—the angel of the bottomless pit. In Hebrew, his name is Abaddon, which means "destruction." In Greek, his name is Apollyon, also meaning "destroyer," and in Latin, his name is Exterminans, meaning "Exterminator."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:12) 
The first "woe"—a period of intense suffering—has now concluded. But observe, two more such periods of woe are still coming after this.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:13) 
Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a single voice speaking from the four horns of the golden altar that stands before the very presence of God. This voice commanded the sixth angel, who held the trumpet, saying, "Release the four angels who are held bound at the great river Euphrates."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:14) 
So the four angels were released. They had been precisely prepared for this specific hour, day, month, and year, to carry out their mission: to kill one-third of all humankind.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:15) 
The number of the army of horsemen was an enormous two hundred million. I personally heard their exact number stated.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:16) 
And this is how I saw the horses in the vision: their riders wore breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfur-yellow. The horses' heads resembled the heads of lions, and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:17) 
It was by these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that erupted from the mouths of the horses—that one-third of all humanity was killed.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:18) 
Indeed, their destructive power resides in both their mouths and their tails. Their tails are like venomous serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:19) 
Indeed, their tails are like serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these serpent-like tails that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:20) 
Despite these devastating plagues, the rest of humanity who were not killed still did not repent of the evil deeds they had done with their own hands. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—lifeless objects that can neither see, hear, nor walk.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:21) 
They did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries and use of poisons, nor of their sexual immoralities, nor of their thefts.

(Revelation 10:1) 
Then I saw another powerful angel descending from the sky, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.

(Revelation 10:2) 
In his hand, he held an open scroll. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.

(Revelation 10:3) 
And he cried out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he had cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

(Revelation 10:4) 
And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices, I was about to write them down. But I heard a voice from the sky telling me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; do not write them."

(Revelation 10:5) 
Then the angel whom I saw standing over the sea and over the land raised his hand to the sky.

(Revelation 10:6) 
And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the universe and all the things that are within it, and the land and all the things that are on it, and the sea and all the things that are within it: that there would be no more delay.

(Revelation 10:7) 
But in the days when the seventh angel will sound his trumpet, when he begins to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be completed, just as He announced through His servants, the prophets.

(Revelation 10:8) 
And I heard the voice from the sky speaking with me again, and it said, "Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing over the sea and over the land."

(Revelation 10:9) 
So I went to the angel, asking him to give me the scroll. And he said to me, "Take it, and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be as sweet as honey."

(Revelation 10:10) 
And I took the scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. And in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.

(Revelation 10:11) 
And the angel said to me, "You must prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:1) 
And I was given a measuring rod, much like a staff, with a voice saying: "Rise up, and measure God's true Temple, and the Altar, and those who genuinely worship within it."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:2) 
But the outer court, the part of the Temple that is outside, do not measure that; instead, leave it out. For it has been given over to the non-believers, who will trample upon the holy city for forty-two months—a specific period of persecution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:3) 
And I will give great power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days—which is the same forty-two months—clothed in sackcloth as a sign of penance and mourning.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:4) 
These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing in the very presence of the Lord who rules the earth, continuously supplied with divine grace and light.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:5) 
And if anyone desires to harm them, divine judgment, like fire, will come out of their mouths and consume their enemies. Indeed, if anyone tries to harm them, they must be killed by this means of divine retribution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:6) 
These witnesses have the divine power to shut up the sky, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire—just like Moses and Elijah.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:7) 
And when they have finished their testimony and their prophetic mission, the Beast that ascends from the abyss—a demonic, anti-Christ power—will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:8) 
And their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom for its wickedness and Egypt for its oppression, the very place where their Lord was crucified, representing the world's rejection of God.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:9) 
And people from every tribe, nation, language, and Gentile group will gaze upon their unburied bodies for three and a half days, and they will not allow their bodies to be placed in tombs, denying them a dignified burial.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:10) 
And those who inhabit the earth will rejoice over their deaths and celebrate loudly. They will even send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented all those who lived on the earth with their calls to repentance and their divine judgments.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:11) 
But after the three and a half days, the very breath of life from God entered into them. And they stood upright on their feet, and tremendous fear gripped everyone who saw this miraculous resurrection.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:12) 
Then they heard a loud voice from the sky telling them, "Come up here!" And they ascended into the sky, carried up in clouds, while their enemies watched them and saw their divine vindication.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:13) 
At that very moment, a great earthquake struck, causing a tenth of the symbolic city to collapse. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors, overcome by terror, gave glory to the God who rules over the sky.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:14) 
The second judgment-woe has passed, and watch closely—the third and final judgment-woe is about to come quickly.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:15) 
And the seventh Angel blew his trumpet. Then, loud voices rang out through the universe, declaring: "The kingdom of this world has now become the eternal kingdom of Our Lord and His Anointed One, and He shall reign over all of it forever and ever!"

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:16) 
And the twenty-four elders, who were always seated before God on their thrones, fell prostrate on their faces and worshipped God, saying:

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:17) 
"We give You thanks, Lord God Almighty, Who always is, and Who always was, and Who is always to come—because You have now taken up Your tremendous power and have begun Your eternal reign."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:18) 
"The nations raged against You, but Your righteous wrath has now come. It is the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and for You to give rewards to Your servants—the prophets and the saints, and to all who revere Your Name, from the least important to the greatest. And it is time for You to utterly destroy those who corrupted the earth."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:19) 
Then the very Temple of God in the universe was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was plainly seen inside His Temple. This revelation was accompanied by flashes of lightning, loud rumblings, thunderclaps, a great earthquake, and massive hailstones falling, signifying divine presence and judgment.

(Revelation 12:1) 
Then a great sign appeared in the sky: A woman was clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars, representing the twelve Apostles and the fullness of the Church.

(Revelation 12:2) 
She was pregnant and cried out in the pain of childbirth, referring to the Virgin Mary giving birth to Christ, and the Church laboring to bring Christ to the world.

(Revelation 12:3) 
Then another sign was seen in the sky: And behold, a great red dragon appeared. It had seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven royal crowns, signifying the vast power and dominion of Satan, the Adversary.

(Revelation 12:4) 
Its tail swept down a third of the stars from the sky and cast them to the earth, representing the fallen angels who rebelled with Satan. The Dragon then stood before the Woman who was about to give birth, so that when she delivered, he might devour her Son, referencing Satan's attempts to destroy Christ.

(Revelation 12:5) 
And she gave birth to a Son, a male child, who is destined to rule all nations with an iron scepter. Her Son, Jesus Christ, was immediately caught up to God and to His throne, signifying His Ascension and divine rule.

(Revelation 12:6) 
The Woman then fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that she might be nourished there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, symbolizing the Church's period of persecution and divine protection.

(Revelation 12:7) 
And a great battle took place in the sky: Michael, the Archangel, and his angels fought against the Dragon. And the Dragon and his angels fought back.

(Revelation 12:8) 
But they were not strong enough, and their place was found no more in the heavens, as Satan and his demons were utterly defeated and cast out.

(Revelation 12:9) 
So the great Dragon was cast down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.

(Revelation 12:10) 
And I heard a loud voice in the sky saying: 'Now salvation has come, and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ! Because the accuser of our brothers, who accused them before the sight of our God day and night, has been cast down!'

(Revelation 12:11) 
And they overcame him because of the Blood of the Lamb, which is Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and because of the word of their testimony to the truth, and they did not love their lives even to the point of death, showing their ultimate fidelity.

(Revelation 12:12) 
Therefore, rejoice, O skies, and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and to the sea, for the Devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time left for his evil work!

(Revelation 12:13) 
And after the Dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he persecuted the Woman, who had given birth to the male child, redirecting his wrath against the Church.

(Revelation 12:14) 
And to the Woman were given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent, signifying God's divine protection of the Church.

(Revelation 12:15) 
And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the Woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be swept away by the current, representing various destructive forces like heresy or persecution aimed at overwhelming the Church.

(Revelation 12:16) 
But the earth helped the Woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the Dragon had cast out of his mouth, showing how divine providence often uses earthly means to protect the Church.

(Revelation 12:17) 
And the Dragon was enraged with the Woman, and he went to wage war with the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifying Satan's ongoing war against individual believers and the faithful remnant of the Church.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:1) 
And I saw a beast rise up from the depths of the sea, and this beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:2) 
The beast I saw was like a leopard in body, but its feet were like a bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The Dragon—Satan himself—gave this beast its power, its throne, and its great authority.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:3) 
One of its heads appeared to have suffered a mortal wound, as if it had been killed, but its deadly wound was healed. The entire world was astonished by this beast and followed it in wonder.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:4) 
And they worshipped the Dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast. They also worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? And who is able to wage war against it?"

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:5) 
The beast was given a mouth that spoke arrogant boasts and blasphemies against God. And it was given authority to exercise its power for forty-two months.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:6) 
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His holy name, His sacred dwelling place, and those who dwell in the spiritual realm with Him.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:7) 
It was also granted to the beast to make war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation on earth.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:8) 
All who live on the earth will worship it—everyone whose name has not been written from the very beginning of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb, who was slain for the sins of humanity.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:9) 
If anyone has ears to hear this truth, let him pay attention.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:10) 
Whoever is destined for captivity will go into captivity; and whoever is to be killed by the sword must be killed by the sword. This calls for the perseverance and the steadfast faith of God's holy people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:11) 
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke with the voice of the Dragon.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:12) 
This second beast exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it forced the earth and all its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound had been healed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:13) 
It performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from the sky to the earth in the plain sight of all people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:14) 
It deceived those who dwell on the earth through the signs it was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast. It ordered the inhabitants of the earth to make an image in honor of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:15) 
The second beast was then allowed to give life to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and could cause all who refused to worship the image of the beast to be killed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:16) 
It also forced all people, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a distinguishing mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:17) 
No one was allowed to buy or sell anything unless they had this mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing its name.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:18) 
Here is wisdom. Let anyone with true understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number. That number is six hundred sixty-six.

(Revelation 14:1) 
And I saw: and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion. With Him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.

(Revelation 14:2) 
And I heard a voice from the sky, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The voice I heard was also like harpers playing on their harps.

(Revelation 14:3) 
And they were singing what seemed to be a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn that song except those one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed and purchased from the earth.

(Revelation 14:4) 
These are those who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were purchased from among humanity as the firstfruits for God and for the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:5) 
And in their mouth no lie was found. For they are without blemish, standing before the throne of God.

(Revelation 14:6) 
And I saw another Angel flying through the middle of the sky, having an eternal Gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people.

(Revelation 14:7) 
Saying with a loud voice: 'Fear the Lord and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the sky and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.'

(Revelation 14:8) 
And another Angel followed, saying: 'Fallen, fallen is that great Babylon! She who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.'

(Revelation 14:9) 
And a third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: 'If anyone worships the Beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,'

(Revelation 14:10) 
that person will also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:11) 
And the smoke of their torments will ascend forever and ever. They have no rest day or night, those who worshipped the Beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.

(Revelation 14:12) 
Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

(Revelation 14:13) 
And I heard a voice from the sky saying to me: 'Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time forward.' The Spirit says that they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.

(Revelation 14:14) 
And I saw: and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:15) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud: 'Send Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe and withered.'

(Revelation 14:16) 
And the One who was seated on the cloud sent His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was reaped.

(Revelation 14:17) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple that is in the spiritual realm, also having a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:18) 
And another Angel came out from the altar, having authority over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: 'Send your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth's vine, for its grapes are fully ripe.'

(Revelation 14:19) 
And the Angel sent his sickle onto the earth, and harvested the vine of the earth, and threw the grapes into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

(Revelation 14:20) 
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress up to the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.

(Revelation 15:1) 
Then I saw another great and amazing sign in the heavenly realm: it was seven angels holding the seven final plagues, because in these plagues, the wrath of God is brought to its ultimate completion.

(Revelation 15:2) 
And I saw something that looked like a sea of glass, mixed with fire. Standing upon this fiery glass sea were those who had triumphed over the beast, and its image, and the number of its name. They were holding harps, given by God.

(Revelation 15:3) 
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They declared: "Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty. Your ways are just and true, O King of the ages, the Lord who reigns through all time."

(Revelation 15:4) 
"Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy and righteous. Indeed, all the nations will come and worship before Your presence, because Your righteous judgments have been made known to all."

(Revelation 15:5) 
And after these things, I looked again, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in the heavenly realm was opened.

(Revelation 15:6) 
And the seven angels came out from the temple, holding the seven plagues. They were clothed with pure and bright stone, shimmering with divine radiance, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.

(Revelation 15:7) 
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels golden bowls, filled to the brim with the wrath of God, the God who lives forever and ever, throughout all ages.

(Revelation 15:8) 
And the temple was filled with smoke, emanating from the majesty of God and from His immense power. And no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fully completed.

(Revelation 16:16:1) 
And I heard a loud voice coming from the Temple. It said to the seven angels: 'Go now, and pour out the seven bowls of God's righteous wrath upon the earth.'

(Revelation 16:16:2) 
So the first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the land. Then a painful and malignant ulcer—a festering sore—appeared on those people who had the mark of the Beast and who worshiped its image.

(Revelation 16:16:3) 
Then the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea. And the sea became like the blood of a dead person—thick and congealed. Every living creature in the sea died because of this.

(Revelation 16:16:4) 
Next, the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water. And they also turned into blood.

(Revelation 16:16:5) 
Then I heard the angel who was responsible for the waters say: 'You are just, O Lord, who exist always, and who always were holy, because You have issued these judgments.'

(Revelation 16:16:6) 
'Because they poured out the blood of Your holy ones and Your prophets, You have given them blood to drink in return. For they deserve this punishment.'

(Revelation 16:16:7) 
And I heard another voice coming from the altar, saying: 'Yes, Lord God Almighty! Your judgments are truthful and righteous!'

(Revelation 16:16:8) 
Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun. And power was given to the sun to scorch people with its intense heat and fire.

(Revelation 16:16:9) 
People were scorched by this extreme heat. Yet they cursed the Name of God—who has authority over these plagues—and they refused to repent and give Him glory.

(Revelation 16:16:10) 
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast. Immediately, its kingdom became consumed by darkness, and people bit their tongues in agonizing pain.

(Revelation 16:16:11) 
They cursed the God of the heavens because of their pains and their sores. Yet they did not repent of their wicked deeds.

(Revelation 16:16:12) 
Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great Euphrates River. And its water dried up, so that a way might be prepared for the kings who come from the rising of the sun—from the East.

(Revelation 16:16:13) 
And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

(Revelation 16:16:14) 
For these are spirits of demons, performing miraculous signs. They go out to the kings of the whole earth and the entire world, to gather them for the battle on the great Day of God Almighty.

(Revelation 16:16:15) 
Behold, I am coming unexpectedly, like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays alert and guards his spiritual garments, so that he may not walk around spiritually naked and his shame be seen by all.

(Revelation 16:16:16) 
And the demonic spirits gathered them together to the place which is called, in Hebrew, Armageddon.

(Revelation 16:16:17) 
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. And a loud voice came out of the Temple, from the throne of God, saying: 'It is finished! It has happened!'

(Revelation 16:16:18) 
And there were lightning flashes, and rumblings, and thunder, and a great earthquake—such an earthquake as has never occurred since humanity has existed on the earth, so tremendous and so great.

(Revelation 16:16:19) 
And the great city split into three parts. The cities of the nations fell into ruin. And great Babylon was remembered before God, so that He might give her the cup of the wine of His fierce, righteous wrath.

(Revelation 16:16:20) 
Every island vanished, and the mountains were no longer found.

(Revelation 16:16:21) 
And a tremendous hailstorm—with hailstones weighing as much as a talent, about one hundred pounds each—fell from the sky upon the people. Yet they cursed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.

(Revelation 17:1) 
One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot, who sits enthroned over many nations and peoples."

(Revelation 17:2) 
The kings of the earth have committed spiritual adultery with her, and those who live on the earth have become drunk and misled by the wine of her spiritual corruption.

(Revelation 17:3) 
The angel carried me away in spirit into a desolate place. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, which was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.

(Revelation 17:4) 
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of her spiritual adultery.

(Revelation 17:5) 
And upon her forehead was a name written: "A Mystery: Babylon the Great, the mother of spiritual adulteries and abominations of the earth."

(Revelation 17:6) 
And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished and filled with wonder.

(Revelation 17:7) 
And the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will tell you the hidden truth about the woman and concerning the beast that carries her, which has seven heads and ten horns."

(Revelation 17:8) 
The beast which you saw was, and is not, and will ascend from the abyss, and then go into destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast, because it was, and is not, yet is about to be present again.

(Revelation 17:9) 
Here is a profound understanding for one who possesses wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman is seated, and these also represent seven kings.

(Revelation 17:10) 
Five of these kings have fallen, one is currently reigning, and another has not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain for a short time.

(Revelation 17:11) 
And the beast that was, and is not, this very beast is also the eighth king, yet it is one of the seven, and it goes into destruction.

(Revelation 17:12) 
And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received royal power, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.

(Revelation 17:13) 
These kings share one common purpose, and they will hand over their strength and authority to the beast.

(Revelation 17:14) 
These will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because He is the Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who are with Him are the called, the chosen, and the faithful.

(Revelation 17:15) 
And he said to me: "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, they are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and languages."

(Revelation 17:16) 
And the ten horns which you saw, belonging to the beast, these kings will hate the harlot. They will make her desolate and stripped bare, they will devour her flesh, and burn her with fire.

(Revelation 17:17) 
For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His will, and to give their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.

(Revelation 17:18) 
And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which holds dominion over the kings of the earth.

(Revelation 18:1) 
And after these things, I saw another Angel descending from the sky,
who had great power.
And the entire earth was illuminated by his glorious presence.

(Revelation 18:2) 
And the Angel cried out with a strong voice, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!
She has become a dwelling place for demons,
a prison for every unclean spirit,
and a prison for every unclean and hateful bird.

(Revelation 18:3) 
This has happened because all nations have drunk of the wine of her passionate fornication.
The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,
and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.”

(Revelation 18:4) 
And I heard another voice from the sky saying:
“Come out from her, My people, all you faithful ones!
Do this so that you may not be sharers in her sins,
and so that you may not receive any of her plagues.

(Revelation 18:5) 
For her sins have reached all the way up to the sky, to the throne of God’s judgment,
and the Lord has remembered her iniquities and will act upon them.

(Revelation 18:6) 
Pay her back just as she herself has paid you, for her evil deeds.
Double her double according to her works.
In the cup which she has mixed for others, mix for her double the amount.

(Revelation 18:7) 
As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously and in pleasure,
so much give her torment and sorrow.
For in her heart she says with pride: ‘I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall see no sorrow or suffering.’

(Revelation 18:8) 
Therefore, in one single day her plagues will come upon her: death, and sorrow, and famine.
And she will be burned with fire.
This will happen because strong is the Lord God, the Almighty, who judges her.

(Revelation 18:9) 
And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived luxuriously will weep and mourn over her,
when they see the smoke of her burning destruction.

(Revelation 18:10) 
They will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
saying: “Woe, woe, that great city, Babylon, that strong city!
For in one hour your judgment has come!”

(Revelation 18:11) 
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her,
because no one will buy their merchandise any longer.

(Revelation 18:12) 
Their merchandise included gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls,
and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
and all fragrant thyme wood,
and all vessels made of ivory,
and all vessels made of precious stone, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble.

(Revelation 18:13) 
Also cinnamon, and amomum (a fragrant spice), and perfumes, and ointment, and frankincense,
and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat,
and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and carriages or chariots,
and slaves, and the very souls of men.

(Revelation 18:14) 
And the fruits your soul passionately desired have departed from you.
And all your rich and splendid things have perished from you,
and they will never, ever be found again.

(Revelation 18:15) 
The merchants of these things, who grew rich from their dealings with her,
will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
weeping and mourning.

(Revelation 18:16) 
And they will be saying: “Woe, woe, that great city,
which was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet,
and adorned with gold, and precious stone, and pearls!

(Revelation 18:17) 
For in one hour such great riches have been laid waste and brought to nothing!”
And every captain, and every passenger on ships, and sailors, and all who sail the sea,
stood far off.

(Revelation 18:18) 
And they cried out, seeing the place of her burning,
saying: “What city was ever like this great city?!”

(Revelation 18:19) 
And they threw dust upon their heads as a sign of deep mourning,
and they cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: “Woe, woe, that great city!
In her, all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth and her costly prices.
For in one single hour she has been utterly desolated!”

(Revelation 18:20) 
Rejoice over her, you inhabitants of the celestial realms, meaning angels and saints,
and you holy Apostles and Prophets!
This is because God has judged your cause against her and brought justice upon her.

(Revelation 18:21) 
And one mighty Angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone, an enormous grinding stone,
and threw it into the sea, saying: “With such violence and force shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down into oblivion,
and she shall never, ever be found again.”

(Revelation 18:22) 
And the sound of harpists, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpets will no longer be heard in you.
And no craftsman of any craft or skill will be found in you any longer.
And the sound of the millstone, for daily bread, will not be heard in you any longer.

(Revelation 18:23) 
And the light of a lamp will shine no longer in you, ending all activity.
And the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, signifying joy and new life, will not be heard in you any longer.
This judgment comes because your merchants were the great ones and rulers of the earth,
and because by your sorceries, deceptions, and spiritual manipulations, all nations were led astray into sin.

(Revelation 18:24) 
And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of all Saints,
of all who were unjustly slain on the earth through the ages.

(Revelation 19:1) 
After these events, I heard what sounded like a massive voice from countless crowds in the spiritual realm, saying: “Praise God! All salvation, all glory, and all power belong to our God.”

(Revelation 19:2) 
“Because His judgments are true and just. He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His servants from her hands.”

(Revelation 19:3) 
And again they said: “Praise God!” And the smoke of her burning ascended forever and ever.

(Revelation 19:4) 
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who was seated upon His throne, saying: “So be it! Praise God!”

(Revelation 19:5) 
And a voice came forth from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants, and you who fear Him, both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:6) 
And I heard what sounded like the voice of a great crowd, and like the sound of many rushing waters, and like the sound of mighty thunderclaps, saying: “Praise God! Because the Lord our Almighty God has begun His reign.”

(Revelation 19:7) 
“Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give glory to Him. Because the Wedding Feast of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has prepared herself for it.”

(Revelation 19:8) 
And it was granted to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.

(Revelation 19:9) 
And He said to me: “Write this down: Blessed are those who are called to the Wedding Supper of the Lamb.” And He said to me: “These words are the true words of God.”

(Revelation 19:10) 
And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me: “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God alone. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy itself.”

(Revelation 19:11) 
And then I saw the spiritual realm opened, and behold, a white horse. And the One who sat upon it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice He judges and makes war.

(Revelation 19:12) 
And His eyes were like a flame of fire, and upon His head were many diadems, and He had a name written on Him which no one knows but Himself.

(Revelation 19:13) 
And He was clothed in a vestment dipped in blood, and His name is called: “The Son of God” (The Word of God).

(Revelation 19:14) 
And the armies of the spiritual realms followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

(Revelation 19:15) 
And from His mouth proceeds a sharp, two-edged sword, that with it He may strike down the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. And He Himself treads the winepress of the furious wrath of Almighty God.

(Revelation 19:16) 
And He has written on His vestment and on His thigh: “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”

(Revelation 19:17) 
And I saw a single Angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that flew through the midst of the sky: “Come, gather yourselves together for the great Supper of God.”

(Revelation 19:18) 
“So that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of tribunes, and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sat upon them, and the flesh of all free men and of servants, and of both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:19) 
And I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat upon the horse, and against His army.

(Revelation 19:20) 
And the Beast was captured, and with it the false prophet, who had performed signs in its presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the Beast and who had worshipped its image. These two, while still alive, were cast into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.

(Revelation 19:21) 
And the rest were slain with the sword of the One who sat upon the horse, which proceeds from His mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:1) 
Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky. He was holding the key to the bottomless pit, the Abyss, and a great chain in his hand.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:2) 
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is also called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, a symbolic period of spiritual confinement.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:3) 
The angel then threw him into the Abyss, shutting it and sealing it over him. This was so the Devil could not deceive the nations and turn them away from God until the thousand years of spiritual confinement were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:4) 
Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for proclaiming Jesus and God's word, and those who had not worshipped the Beast or its image, nor received its mark on their foreheads or hands. These souls came to life and reigned with Christ for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:5) 
The rest of the spiritually dead did not come to life in this way until the thousand years were finished. This is what is meant by the first resurrection: a spiritual reawakening and reign with Christ.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:6) 
Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in this first resurrection, meaning a spiritual reign with Christ. Over these, the second death—eternal damnation in hell—has no power. Instead, they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with Him for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:7) 
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his spiritual prison. He will then go out to deceive the nations throughout the whole earth—Gog and Magog, representing all who oppose God—and gather them for a final spiritual battle. Their numbers will be as countless as the sand of the sea.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:8) 
They marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, which is the Church.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:9) 
Then fire came down from God out of the sky and consumed them all. And the Devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the False Prophet had already been cast. There they will be tormented day and night for all eternity.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:10) 
Then I saw a great white throne, and One sitting on it. Before His presence, the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:11) 
I saw all the dead, both great and small, standing before the throne. Books were opened, which contained records of their lives. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their deeds, which were written in those books.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:12) 
The sea gave up the dead that were in it. And Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) gave up their dead that were in them. Every single person was judged according to what they had done in their lives.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:13) 
And Death itself and Hades (the realm of the dead) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, which is eternal damnation.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:14) 
If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, that person was cast into the lake of fire, suffering eternal damnation.

(Revelation 21:1) 
I then saw a new universe and a new earth. The old universe and the old earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.

(Revelation 21:2) 
And I, John, saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the sky from God. It was prepared like a bride beautifully adorned for her husband.

(Revelation 21:3) 
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with humanity, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.'

(Revelation 21:4) 
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain anymore, because the former things have passed away.

(Revelation 21:5) 
And He who sat on the throne said: 'Behold, I am making all things new.' He also said to me, 'Write, for these words are utterly trustworthy and true.'

(Revelation 21:6) 
And He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end of all things. To the one who thirsts, I will give water from the fountain of life as a free gift.'

(Revelation 21:7) 
The one who overcomes will inherit these things. And I will be his God, and he will be My son.

(Revelation 21:8) 
But for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the detestable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars—their destiny will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

(Revelation 21:9) 
Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came and spoke with me, saying: 'Come, and I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.'

(Revelation 21:10) 
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending out of the sky from God.

(Revelation 21:11) 
It had the glory of God. Its radiance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.

(Revelation 21:12) 
It had a great, high wall with twelve gates. At the gates were twelve angels, and names were inscribed on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 21:13) 
There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.

(Revelation 21:14) 
The wall of the City also had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

(Revelation 21:15) 
The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the City, its gates, and its wall.

(Revelation 21:16) 
The City was laid out as a square, and its length was as great as its width. He measured the City with the golden rod, and it was twelve thousand stadia long. Its length, height, and width were all equal.

(Revelation 21:17) 
He also measured its wall, which was one hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure—this refers to the unit of measurement that angels use, not their physical size.

(Revelation 21:18) 
The wall was built of jasper, and the City itself was pure gold, clear as pure glass.

(Revelation 21:19) 
The foundations of the City wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

(Revelation 21:20) 
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

(Revelation 21:21) 
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made from a single pearl. And the main street of the City was pure gold, as transparent as glass.

(Revelation 21:22) 
I saw no temple within it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

(Revelation 21:23) 
The City has no need of the sun or the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its lamp.

(Revelation 21:24) 
The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory and honor into it.

(Revelation 21:25) 
Its gates will never be shut by day, because there will be no night there.

(Revelation 21:26) 
And they will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

(Revelation 21:27) 
Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life will enter.

(Revelation 22:2) 
In the middle of the city's main street, and on both sides of the river, stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

(Revelation 22:3) 
And there will be no more curse or damnation. Instead, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him directly.

(Revelation 22:4) 
They will see His face directly, and His name will be visibly marked on their foreheads, showing their complete belonging to Him.

(Revelation 22:5) 
And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God Himself will enlighten them, and they will reign with Him forever and ever.

(Revelation 22:6) 
And the angel said to me: "These words are most trustworthy and true. For the Lord God, who inspires the spirits of the prophets, has sent His Angel to show His servants what must soon take place."

(Revelation 22:7) 
"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who truly keeps the words of the prophecy contained in this book."

(Revelation 22:8) 
And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. After I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel who had shown me these things.

(Revelation 22:9) 
And he said to me: "Do not do that! For I am a fellow servant with you, and with your brethren the prophets, and with all those who keep the words of this book. Worship God alone, for He is the only one worthy."

(Revelation 22:10) 
And he said to me: "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time for these events is near."

(Revelation 22:11) 
"Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong still, and let him who is filthy remain filthy still. But let him who is just continue to be justified still, and let him who is holy continue to be sanctified still." This means that soon, each person's spiritual state will be fixed.

(Revelation 22:12) 
"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, so that I may render to each person according to their works."

(Revelation 22:13) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega, which means I am the First and the Last, the very Beginning and the End of all things."

(Revelation 22:14) 
Blessed are those who wash their robes in the Blood of the Lamb, so that they may have the right to eat from the tree of life and may enter into the Holy City through its gates.

(Revelation 22:15) 
Outside the Holy City are the dogs—meaning the impure and those who oppose God—along with sorcerers, the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

(Revelation 22:16) 
"I, Jesus, have sent My Angel to give you this testimony for all the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright, splendid Morning Star."

(Revelation 22:17) 
And the Holy Spirit and the Church, His Bride, say: "Come, Lord Jesus!" And let everyone who hears this also say: "Come!" Let anyone who is spiritually thirsty come, and let anyone who wills, take the water of life freely, as a gift.

(Revelation 22:18) 
For I solemnly testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone presumes to add to these revealed truths, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:19) 
And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion from the tree of life and from the Holy City, and from the blessings that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:20) 
He who gives testimony to these things, which is Jesus Himself, says: "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!

(Revelation 22:21) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
