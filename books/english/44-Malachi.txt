(Malachi 1:1) 
This is the message from God, spoken to Israel through Malachi.

(Malachi 1:2) 
“I have loved you,” says God. But you say: “How have you loved us?” “Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?” says God. “I loved Jacob,

(Malachi 1:3) 
but I rejected Esau. I made his mountains into desolate wastelands, and turned his inheritance over to desert jackals.”

(Malachi 1:4) 
If the people of Edom say: “We are ruined, but we will rebuild the ruins,” then God says: “They may rebuild, but I will tear it down again. And they will be called ‘the territory of wickedness,’ and ‘the people whom God hates forever.’”

(Malachi 1:5) 
Your eyes will see this, and you will say, “God's glory extends beyond the borders of Israel!”

(Malachi 1:6) 
A son honors his father, and a servant honors his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due to me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due to me?” says God. “You priests despise my name, but you ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’”

(Malachi 1:7) 
You bring polluted food to my altar and ask, “How have we polluted you?” By saying, “God's table is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:8) 
When you offer a blind animal as a sacrifice, is that not evil? When you offer a lame or diseased animal, is that not evil? Offer it to your governor! Would he accept you or show you favor?” says God.

(Malachi 1:9) 
Now, plead with God for mercy! Because of your actions, will he accept your offerings?

(Malachi 1:10) 
Who among you will close the doors so that you do not light a useless fire on my altar? I have no pleasure in you,” says God, “and I will accept no offering from your hand.

(Malachi 1:11) 
From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is honored among the nations. In every place, incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering is made to me, because my name is great among the nations,” says God.

(Malachi 1:12) 
But you profane it by saying, “God’s table is polluted, and its food is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:13) 
You also say, “How tedious!” And you turn up your noses at it,” says God. “You bring what you have stolen, what is lame or diseased, and offer it as a sacrifice. Should I accept it from your hands?” says God.

(Malachi 1:14) 
Cursed is the deceiver who has a male in his flock, but vows to sacrifice a defective animal to God. For I am a great king,” says God, “and my name is feared among the nations.”

(Malachi 2:1) 
And now, priests, this is your mission.

(Malachi 2:2) 
If you do not listen to this command, and if you do not give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, I will send a famine among you. And I will curse your blessings, and I have already cursed them, because you have not taken this to heart.

(Malachi 2:3) 
Behold, I will rebuke you, and I will scatter your waste on your faces, the waste of your feast days. And you will be taken away with it.

(Malachi 2:4) 
And you will know that I have sent this mission to you, to fulfill my covenant with Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:5) 
My covenant with him was for life and peace, and I gave him reverence, and he reverenced me, and he feared my name.

(Malachi 2:6) 
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and equity, and he turned many away from iniquity.

(Malachi 2:7) 
For the lips of the priest guard knowledge, and they seek the law from his mouth, because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:8) 
But you have turned away from the way, and you have caused many to stumble in the law. You have destroyed the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:9) 
Therefore I also have made you contemptible and abject before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have accepted faces in the law.

(Malachi 2:10) 
Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why, then, do you despise your brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?

(Malachi 2:11) 
Judah has acted treacherously, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and has fallen into it.

(Malachi 2:12) 
May the Lord cut off the man who does this: who watches and answers from the tents of Jacob, and who offers an offering to the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:13) 
And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, and weeping, and wailing, so that I no longer look at the sacrifice, nor do I accept it with favor from your hand.

(Malachi 2:14) 
And you said: Why? Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised. For she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.

(Malachi 2:15) 
Did He not make one flesh, and has the remnant of His Spirit? And why does He seek one flesh? And seeking the seed of God. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not despise the wife of your youth.

(Malachi 2:16) 
If you hate her, put her away, says the Lord God of Israel: for iniquity shall cover your iniquity, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not act treacherously.

(Malachi 2:17) 
You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you said: How have we wearied Him? In that you say: Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such things are pleasing to Him. Or, where is the God of justice?

(Malachi 3:1) 
I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And suddenly the Master you seek will come, and the angel of the covenant you desire. Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:2) 
Who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' herb.

(Malachi 3:3) 
He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will make offerings to the Lord in righteousness.

(Malachi 3:4) 
Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years.

(Malachi 3:5) 
I will come to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who oppress the wage earner, the widow, and the orphan, and those who turn aside the stranger, and do not fear Me, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:6) 
For I am the Lord, and I do not change. Therefore, you, the sons of Jacob, are not consumed.

(Malachi 3:7) 
From the days of your fathers you have turned away from My ordinances and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you said, ‘How shall we return?’

(Malachi 3:8) 
Will a man rob God? Yet you rob Me. But you say, ‘In what do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.

(Malachi 3:9) 
You are cursed, because you rob Me, the whole nation of you.

(Malachi 3:10) 
Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this, says the Lord of hosts. See if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing for you until there is no room enough to receive it.

(Malachi 3:11) 
I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your ground, and the vine in your field shall not be barren, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:12) 
Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:13) 
Your words have been harsh against Me, says the Lord. But you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’

(Malachi 3:14) 
You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts?’

(Malachi 3:15) 
So now we call the arrogant blessed. For those who do wickedness are built up; they have tempted God and are saved.

(Malachi 3:16) 
Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another. The Lord paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name.

(Malachi 3:17) 
They will be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day that I am making, and they will be My special possession. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.

(Malachi 3:18) 
Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not serve Him.

(Malachi 4:1) 
Behold, the day is coming, it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and everyone who practices wickedness will be like straw. The coming day will consume them, says the Lord of hosts, leaving them neither root nor branch.

(Malachi 4:2) 
But for you who fear My name, the Son of justice will rise, and salvation will be under His wings. You will leave the darkness and leap about with joy, like calves from the stall.

(Malachi 4:3) 
Then you will trample upon the wicked, they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I act, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 4:4) 
Remember the law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, the precepts and judgments.

(Malachi 4:5) 
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.

(Malachi 4:6) 
He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a curse.
