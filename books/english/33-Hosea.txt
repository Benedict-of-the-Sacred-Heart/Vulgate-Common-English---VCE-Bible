(Hosea 1:1) 
The Son's message was given to Hosea son of Beeri, during the reigns of kings of Judah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. It was also during the time of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.

(Hosea 1:2) 
This is the beginning of the Lord's message to Hosea. The Lord told Hosea: “Go, and take for yourself a wife who is a prostitute, and children born from her promiscuity. Because the land itself will become unfaithful, committing sins, abandoning its duties to the Lord.”

(Hosea 1:3) 
So Hosea went and married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim. She conceived and bore him a son.

(Hosea 1:4) 
And the Lord said, “Name him Jezreel, because soon I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed in Jezreel. I will end the kingdom of the house of Israel.”

(Hosea 1:5) 
And in that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

(Hosea 1:6) 
She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-ruchamah, which means 'not pitied', because I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel. I will utterly forget them.”

(Hosea 1:7) 
But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God. I will not save them by means of bows, swords, warfare, horses, or riders.

(Hosea 1:8) 
After she had weaned Lo-ruchamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.

(Hosea 1:9) 
And the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi, which means 'not my people', because you are not my people, and I am not your God.”

(Hosea 1:10) 
Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where they were told, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'

(Hosea 1:11) 
The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint one leader and then leave the land. For a great day will come to Jezreel.

(Hosea 2:1) 
Hear the Word of the Lord, children of Israel! The Lord has a case against those who inhabit the land because there is no truth, there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.

(Hosea 2:2) 
They swear falsely, they lie, murder, steal, and commit adultery. Violence and bloodshed are everywhere.

(Hosea 2:3) 
For these sins, the land will mourn, and everyone who lives there will grow weak. Even the beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the fish in the sea will be affected.

(Hosea 2:4) 
Nevertheless, let no one judge or accuse anyone, for my people are like those who are not judged.

(Hosea 2:5) 
My people will fall because they lack knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving me as a priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will forget your children.

(Hosea 2:6) 
The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame.

(Hosea 2:7) 
They eat the sin of my people and raise their souls to iniquity.

(Hosea 2:8) 
The priest will be like the people. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.

(Hosea 2:9) 
They will eat, but not be satisfied. They have committed whoredom, but they have not increased, because they have abandoned the Lord.

(Hosea 2:10) 
Whoredom, wine, and drunkenness take away the heart.

(Hosea 2:11) 
My people consult their wood, and their staff gives them oracles. For the spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have departed from their God to commit whoredom.

(Hosea 2:12) 
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth trees because their shade is good. Therefore, your daughters will commit whoredom, and your brides will commit adultery.

(Hosea 2:13) 
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your brides when they commit adultery, for the men themselves consort with prostitutes and sacrifice with cult prostitutes. A people without understanding will fall.

(Hosea 2:14) 
Though you, Israel, commit whoredom, let not Judah offend, nor enter Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, 'As the Lord lives.'

(Hosea 2:15) 
For Israel is like a stubborn heifer; now the Lord will pasture them like a lamb in an open place.

(Hosea 2:16) 
Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.

(Hosea 2:17) 
Their drink is gone; they have committed whoredom. Their rulers dearly love shame.

(Hosea 2:18) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 2:19) 
A wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 2:20) 
Say this to the house of Jacob, and to all the remnants of the house of Israel, who swear by the name of the Lord, and invoke the God of Israel, but not in truth or righteousness.

(Hosea 2:21) 
For they call themselves after the holy city, and glory in the God of Israel, but not in truth.

(Hosea 2:22) 
Therefore, I will be like a harlot to you, Israel. Don't go to Gilgal, don't go up to Beth-aven, and don't swear, 'As the Lord lives.'

(Hosea 2:23) 
For like a stubborn heifer, you have turned away from the Lord. Now he will pasture you like a lamb in an open place.

(Hosea 2:24) 
When their drinking is over, they commit whoredom, and their rulers dearly love shame. The shield of her protectors is shame.

(Hosea 2:25) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and she will be ashamed of her sacrifices.

(Hosea 3:1) 
And the Lord said to me: “Go again, and love a woman who is loved by a neighbor and is an adulteress. This is how the Lord loves the children of Israel, even though they are looking to other gods, and are fond of raisin cakes.”

(Hosea 3:2) 
So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver, a measure of barley, and a container of wine.

(Hosea 3:3) 
I said to her: “You will wait for me for many days. You will not be unfaithful, nor will you belong to any other man, and I will also wait for you.”

(Hosea 3:4) 
For the children of Israel will remain for many days without a king, and without a leader, and without sacrifices, and without an altar, and without the priestly vestments, and without household gods.

(Hosea 3:5) 
After this, the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king. They will fear the Lord, and His goodness at the end of days.

(Hosea 4:1) 
Hear the word of the Lord, children of Israel, because the Lord has a case against those who live on the earth, because there is no truth, no mercy, and no knowledge of God in the land.

(Hosea 4:2) 
Lying, and deceit, and murder, and theft, and adultery have come to light, and bloodshed follows more bloodshed.

(Hosea 4:3) 
That is why the land will mourn, and everyone who lives in it will be weakened, with the wild animals of the field and the birds of the sky, and even the fish of the sea will disappear.

(Hosea 4:4) 
But let no one bring a charge, or accuse anyone: for my people are like those who have no knowledge.

(Hosea 4:5) 
Israel does not understand this: they have their implements made of wood. In their divination there is an arrow, and in their part they have a shield.

(Hosea 4:6) 
That is why my people will fail, because they have no knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you, so that you will not function as a priest for me; and because you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.

(Hosea 4:7) 
The more they have multiplied, the more they have sinned against me: I will change their glory into disgrace.

(Hosea 4:8) 
They will eat the sins of my people, and they will lift up their souls towards their iniquity.

(Hosea 4:9) 
It will be: like people, so also the priest: and I will visit upon him his ways, and I will give to him according to his works.

(Hosea 4:10) 
They will eat, and not be satisfied: they have committed fornication, and have not increased, because they have abandoned the Lord for wantonness.

(Hosea 4:11) 
Fornication, wine, and drunkenness take away the heart.

(Hosea 4:12) 
My people seek counsel from their wood, and their staff declares to them: for a spirit of fornication has seduced them, and they have committed fornication against their God.

(Hosea 4:13) 
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and they offer incense on the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the elm, because its shade is good: that is why your daughters commit fornication, and your brides commit adultery.

(Hosea 4:14) 
I will not punish your daughters when they commit fornication, or your brides when they commit adultery: because they themselves are involved with prostitutes, and with effeminate men, the undisciplined people sacrifice.

(Hosea 4:15) 
If you, Israel, commit fornication, let not Judah trespass; and let them not enter into Gilgal, and let them not go up to Beth-aven, nor swear “As the Lord lives.”

(Hosea 4:16) 
Because Israel is wanton, like a heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in the open space.

(Hosea 4:17) 
Ephraim has been associated with idols: let her be.

(Hosea 4:18) 
Their drinking is polluted, they are exhausted: they have committed fornication, they have loved it, they have despised their shield.

(Hosea 4:19) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 5:1) 
Listen to this, priests. Pay attention, house of Israel! Give ear, you in the royal household! The judgment is against you. You are caught in a trap at Mizpah, and a net spread over Tabor.

(Hosea 5:2) 
The rebels of Israel have gone deep into sin. But I know them all.

(Hosea 5:3) 
I know Ephraim. Israel is not hidden from Me. Now, Ephraim, you have committed spiritual adultery. Israel is corrupted.

(Hosea 5:4) 
They will not turn from their ways, to turn back to their God, because the spirit of spiritual adultery is within them, and they do not know the Lord.

(Hosea 5:5) 
The pride of Israel condemns them. Israel and Ephraim will fall because of their sin. Judah will also fall.

(Hosea 5:6) 
They will go to seek the Lord with their flocks and herds, but they will not find Him, because He has departed from them.

(Hosea 5:7) 
They have acted against the Lord, because they have had children with other gods. Now, the new moon with their feasts will consume them.

(Hosea 5:8) 
Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Cry out in Beth-Aven! Fear the coming judgment, O Benjamin!

(Hosea 5:9) 
Ephraim will be made desolate in the day of rebuke. I have made known the truth among the tribes of Israel, like a root is their corruption.

(Hosea 5:10) 
The leaders of Judah have become like those who move boundary stones, so I will pour out My wrath on them like water.

(Hosea 5:11) 
Ephraim is oppressed and crushed by judgment, because they have begun to walk after idols.

(Hosea 5:12) 
I will be like a moth to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah.

(Hosea 5:13) 
Ephraim sees its sickness, and Judah sees its wounds. Then Ephraim goes to Assyria and sends to King Jareb, but he cannot heal you nor cure your wounds.

(Hosea 5:14) 
I will be like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, yes I, will tear them to pieces and then I will depart. There is no one to save them.

(Hosea 5:15) 
They will go back to their own place, and will not return until they acknowledge their sin and failure. In their suffering, they will seek My face.

(Hosea 6:1) 
Come, and let’s return to the Lord, because He wounds us, and He will heal us. He strikes, and He will cure us.

(Hosea 6:2) 
After two days, He will give us life. On the third day, He will raise us up, and we will live in His presence.

(Hosea 6:3) 
Let us strive to know the Lord. As surely as the dawn appears, so will He come forth. He will come to us like the rain—the early and the late rain to the earth.

(Hosea 6:4) 
What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love for Me is like the morning clouds, and like the morning dew that disappears.

(Hosea 6:5) 
Therefore, I hacked them to pieces by the prophets; I killed them with the words of My mouth, and the judgment of God is like the light that goes forth.

(Hosea 6:6) 
For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

(Hosea 6:7) 
But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant. There, they despised Me.

(Hosea 6:8) 
Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with blood.

(Hosea 6:9) 
They act like a band of robbers, lying in wait on the road. They strike.

(Hosea 6:10) 
In the house of Israel, I saw a horrible thing. There are adulteries with Ephraim; Israel is defiled.

(Hosea 6:11) 
Also, Judah, a harvest is appointed for you when I return the captivity of My people.

(Hosea 7:1) 
When I, the Lord, wanted to heal Israel, I found the sins of Ephraim—the northern kingdom—and the wickedness of Samaria—its capital city. For they have lied to me and turned away from me, and a thief breaks into a house to steal.

(Hosea 7:2) 
They don’t realize that I know all their evil actions. They think their wicked deeds have hidden them from me. These actions of theirs are right in front of my face.

(Hosea 7:3) 
They make their king happy with their wicked deeds, and their leaders happy with their schemes and lies.

(Hosea 7:4) 
All of them are unfaithful, like a baker’s oven that is heated. The baker stops stirring the dough after he mixes in the ingredients, and then he waits for the dough to rise.

(Hosea 7:5) 
In the day of our king, the leaders became drunk with wine and made a mess.

(Hosea 7:6) 
Their hearts are like a heated oven, and they plan all night long. In the morning, it is as if the oven is on fire.

(Hosea 7:7) 
All of them are hot like an oven, and they have consumed their judges and their kings. None of them call on me.

(Hosea 7:8) 
Ephraim has mingled himself among the nations. Ephraim is now like a cake that is not flipped on the griddle.

(Hosea 7:9) 
Foreigners have drained his strength. He does not know it. Gray hairs are sprinkled on him, but he does not know it.

(Hosea 7:10) 
Israel’s pride testifies against him. Yet they have not returned to the Lord their God. They have not sought him in all these things.

(Hosea 7:11) 
Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without a heart. They call to Egypt, and they go to Assyria.

(Hosea 7:12) 
When they go there, I will spread my net over them. I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will punish them as their community has heard.

(Hosea 7:13) 
Woe to them, for they have fled from me! Destruction to them, because they have transgressed against me. Although I have redeemed them, they have spoken lies against me.

(Hosea 7:14) 
They did not cry out to me with their hearts, but they wailed on their beds. They have separated themselves from me, but they will gather grain and wine.

(Hosea 7:15) 
Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, they plot evil against me.

(Hosea 7:16) 
They turned, but not to the Most High. They have become like a faulty bow. They will fall by the sword because of the rage of their tongues. They will become a joke in the land of Egypt.

(Hosea 8:1) 
Sound the trumpet! Like an eagle over the house of the Lord, because they have broken my covenant and defied my law.

(Hosea 8:2) 
They will cry out to me: 'My God, we know you, Israel.'

(Hosea 8:3) 
Israel has rejected what is good; now, an enemy will chase after him.

(Hosea 8:4) 
They set up their own rulers, not those I chose. They made idols from their silver and gold, which will destroy them.

(Hosea 8:5) 
Cast out your calf, Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be unable to be cleansed?

(Hosea 8:6) 
Because it is from Israel, this calf. A craftsman made it, but it is not God. It will be broken.

(Hosea 8:7) 
They sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk and it will not produce grain. If it did, strangers would devour it.

(Hosea 8:8) 
Israel is being destroyed. Now he is among the nations like a vessel with no purpose.

(Hosea 8:9) 
For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.

(Hosea 8:10) 
Indeed, they have hired lovers among the nations. Now, I will gather them, and they will rest a little from the burden of the king and the princes.

(Hosea 8:11) 
Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have become for him as a way to sin.

(Hosea 8:12) 
I wrote many things from my law for him, but they were considered as foreign.

(Hosea 8:13) 
They offer sacrifices, and eat the flesh, but it is not pleasing to the Lord. Now, He will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. They will return to Egypt.

(Hosea 8:14) 
And Israel will forget his maker, and will build palaces. And he will multiply altars for sinning.

(Hosea 8:15) 
I will send fire into his cities, and it will devour his palaces.

(Hosea 9:1) 
Do not be like the pagans, O Israel. Because you committed fornication from God. You loved the gifts that came from others more than God, who provides everything.

(Hosea 9:2) 
Neither the harvest fields nor the wine will give what you think. The wine will deceive you.

(Hosea 9:3) 
They will not live in the land of the Lord. Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat impure food.

(Hosea 9:4) 
They will not offer wine to the Lord, and it will not please Him. Like the bread of mourning, all those who eat it will be defiled, because their bread is for themselves.

(Hosea 9:5) 
What will you do on the feast day, and on the day of the festival of the Lord?

(Hosea 9:6) 
Look, because they have left, they will be ravaged. Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them. The most prized of their possessions, will become nettles. Thorns will be in their tabernacles.

(Hosea 9:7) 
The days of visitation have come, the days of retribution have come. Israel will know this. The prophet is a fool, and is crazy in his own spirit, because of the multitude of your iniquities, and the great turning away from God.

(Hosea 9:8) 
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: a prophet is a snare for a bird-catcher in all his ways, and there is a turning away from the house of God.

(Hosea 9:9) 
They have sinned even more deeply than in the days of Gibeah: He will remember their iniquity and visit their sins.

(Hosea 9:10) 
I found Israel as the grapes in the desert. I saw your fathers like the first fruits of the fig tree in their early season: They went in to Baal-phegor, and were separated in him, and became abominable as they loved.

(Hosea 9:11) 
Ephraim will fly away like a bird: from glory, from offspring, from the womb, and from conception.

(Hosea 9:12) 
And even if they raise their sons, I will take them away without a man. Woe to them when I depart from them.

(Hosea 9:13) 
Ephraim, like I see, is planted in Tyre in beauty: and Ephraim will bring forth his sons to be killed.

(Hosea 9:14) 
Give them, O Lord: what will you give? Give them a womb without conception.

(Hosea 9:15) 
All their wickedness is at Gilgal, because I hate them there: because of the evil of their works I will cast them from my house. I will not continue to love them, all their princes are rebellious.

(Hosea 9:16) 
Ephraim is struck, their root has withered, they will not bear fruit. And if they conceive, I will kill their most desired children.

(Hosea 9:17) 
My God will cast them away, because they did not hear Him: and they will wander among the gentiles.

(Hosea 10:1) 
Israel was like a special vineyard, producing valuable grain for itself. Because of its abundance of crops, it multiplied altars. Because of the fertility of its land, it made statues to pagan gods.

(Hosea 10:2) 
Their hearts are divided and weakened. They will soon be destroyed. God Himself will smash their idols to pieces; their idol-statues will be shattered.

(Hosea 10:3) 
For now they are saying: "We have no king, because we have no fear of the Lord." And what can a king do for us now?

(Hosea 10:4) 
They speak wickedness, making false promises, and entering into treaties with oaths. Therefore, judgment will spring up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.

(Hosea 10:5) 
The people of Israel will be terrified by the false idols of Beth-aven. The people and their priests will mourn and wail because the glory of Israel has been exiled.

(Hosea 10:6) 
Israel and its priests will also be carried away as tribute to the king of Assyria. Israel and Ephraim will be ashamed of their own plans.

(Hosea 10:7) 
Samaria will be destroyed because it has rebelled against its God. The people will fall by the sword; their little children will be crushed, and the pregnant women will be ripped open.

(Hosea 10:8) 
Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have fallen because of your sin.

(Hosea 10:9) 
Prepare your words, and return to the Lord. Say to Him, "Forgive all our wickedness, and receive us in Your goodness, and we will give You our own thanks."

(Hosea 10:10) 
Assyria will not save us. We will not ride on horses. We will no longer say to the works of our hands, "You are our gods," because in You, O Lord, the orphan finds mercy.

(Hosea 10:11) 
I will heal their wounds. I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from them.

(Hosea 10:12) 
I will be like the morning dew. Israel will sprout like a lily and send out its roots like the trees of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:13) 
Its branches will spread out, and its glory will be like the olive tree. It will have a pleasant aroma like the cedars of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:14) 
Those who dwell in its shadow will return; they will revive and flourish like the grain; they will grow like a vine. Their remembrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:15) 
Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and watch over him. I am like a flourishing cypress tree; your fruit comes from Me.

(Hosea 11:1) 
When Israel was a child, I loved him: and I called my son out of Egypt.

(Hosea 11:2) 
The more I called them, the more they went away from me: they sacrificed to the Baals, and offered incense to carved images.

(Hosea 11:3) 
Yet I myself was like a father to Ephraim: I carried them on my arm, and they did not realize that I would be there for them.

(Hosea 11:4) 
I drew them with ties of men, with bonds of love: and I was to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws: and I cared for them.

(Hosea 11:5) 
They shall not return to the land of Egypt: and Assur himself shall be their master, because they would not turn back to Me.

(Hosea 11:6) 
The sword will rage in his cities, and will consume his bars, and devour them because of their wickedness.

(Hosea 11:7) 
And my people shall hang in suspense as they return to Me: and if he calls upon Me, I will not exalt them at the same time.

(Hosea 11:8) 
How shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall I protect you, Israel? How shall I give you up as Adama? Shall I make you like Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, and my repentance is disturbed at once.

(Hosea 11:9) 
I will not execute the wrath of my anger: I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man: the Holy One in your midst, and I will not enter the city.

(Hosea 11:10) 
The Lord will walk after him: he shall roar like a lion, he shall roar: and the children of the sea shall tremble.

(Hosea 11:11) 
And they shall fly away like a bird out of Egypt: and like a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will place them in their houses, says the Lord.

(Hosea 11:12) 
Ephraim has surrounded Me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah is still walking with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.

(Hosea 12:1) 
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, and the house of Israel surrounds Me with deceit. But now, Judah still trusts God, and remains faithful to the Holy Ones.

(Hosea 12:2) 
Ephraim seeks emptiness, and follows the desert wind: all day long he multiplies lies and violence. He has also made a covenant with the Assyrians, and carries oil to Egypt.

(Hosea 12:3) 
Therefore, the Lord will contend with Israel in Judah, and will visit Jacob, and will repay him according to his ways and deeds.

(Hosea 12:4) 
In the womb, he supplanted his brother, and he had power with God.

(Hosea 12:5) 
He had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication to him. At Bethel, he found Him, and there He spoke with us.

(Hosea 12:6) 
The Lord God of hosts, the Lord is His memorial.

(Hosea 12:7) 
So you, return to your God: keep mercy and judgment, and hope in your God always.

(Hosea 12:8) 
Canaan has a fraudulent balance in his hand, and desires to defraud.

(Hosea 12:9) 
And Ephraim said: "Surely I have become rich, I have found for myself rest: all my works will not discover in me the iniquity which I have done."

(Hosea 12:10) 
But I am the Lord your God, from the land of Egypt: I will yet make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the feast.

(Hosea 12:11) 
And I have spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and I have been likened by the hands of the prophets.

(Hosea 12:12) 
If Gilead is iniquity, truly they were in vain: in Gilgal they sacrificed to bulls: their altars also are as heaps in the furrows of the field.

(Hosea 12:13) 
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and he was nourished for a wife.

(Hosea 12:14) 
And the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet he was kept.

(Hosea 12:15) 
Ephraim provoked in bitterness: his blood will be left behind, and his ignominy will be restored to him.

(Hosea 13:1) 
Ephraim was feared when he spoke, a leader in Israel, but he was already dead to God, and addicted to the sin of Baal.

(Hosea 13:2) 
And now they make their sins even worse, manufacturing idols of silver, works of craftsmen. They tell these idols: “Sacrifice people!”—men who kiss the idols.

(Hosea 13:3) 
Therefore, they will become like morning mist, like passing morning dew, like dust blown from the threshing floor, and like smoke from a chimney.

(Hosea 13:4) 
Yet I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no other gods besides Me, for there is no savior except Me.

(Hosea 13:5) 
I knew you in the desert, in the land of solitude.

(Hosea 13:6) 
When they had fed, their hearts grew proud, and they forgot Me.

(Hosea 13:7) 
So I became like a lion to them, like a leopard on the road of the Assyrians.

(Hosea 13:8) 
I will meet them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and I will tear open their hearts. There I will devour them like a lion; wild beasts will tear them apart.

(Hosea 13:9) 
Israel, you are destroyed because you are against Me, against your help.

(Hosea 13:10) 
Where is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? And where are your judges, of whom you said, “Give me a king and princes”?

(Hosea 13:11) 
I gave you a king in My anger, and I took him away in My wrath.

(Hosea 13:12) 
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound, his sin is stored up.

(Hosea 13:13) 
The pangs of childbirth will come to him, but he is a foolish son. For it is not yet time to open the womb.

(Hosea 13:14)
