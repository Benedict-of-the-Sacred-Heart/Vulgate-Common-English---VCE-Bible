(James 1:James 1:1) 
James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, sends greetings to the twelve tribes who are scattered abroad.

(James 1:James 1:2) 
My brothers, consider it a cause for total joy when you encounter many different kinds of trials.

(James 1:James 1:3) 
This is because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance within you.

(James 1:James 1:4) 
But perseverance must do its perfect work so that you may become perfect and complete, lacking nothing spiritually.

(James 1:James 1:5) 
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all and does not reproach anyone for asking, and it will be given to him.

(James 1:James 1:6) 
But let him ask in faith, without any doubting in his mind. For whoever doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind.

(James 1:James 1:7) 
Let that man not imagine that he will receive anything from the Lord.

(James 1:James 1:8) 
A man who is double-minded is unstable in all his ways and actions.

(James 1:James 1:9) 
But let the brother of humble means glory in his true exaltation, which is God's grace.

(James 1:James 1:10) 
And let the rich man glory in his humility, because he will pass away like the flower of the field.

(James 1:James 1:11) 
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. Its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance perishes completely. So also will the rich man fade away in all his worldly endeavors.

(James 1:James 1:12) 
Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because when he has been proven to be faithful, he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love Him.

(James 1:James 1:13) 
Let no one who is tempted say that he is being tempted by God. For God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself tempts no one to do evil.

(James 1:James 1:14) 
But each person is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own evil desires.

(James 1:James 1:15) 
Then, when evil desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And when sin is fully grown, it brings forth eternal death.

(James 1:James 1:16) 
Do not be deceived, my most beloved brothers.

(James 1:James 1:17) 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of change.

(James 1:James 1:18) 
By His own will, He brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creation.

(James 1:James 1:19) 
You know this, my most beloved brothers. But let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.

(James 1:James 1:20) 
For the anger of man does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

(James 1:James 1:21) 
Therefore, cast off all impurity and every overflowing remnant of malice. And humbly receive the implanted word of God, which has the power to save your souls.

(James 1:James 1:22) 
But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves with false piety.

(James 1:James 1:23) 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.

(James 1:James 1:24) 
For he observes himself, then walks away, and immediately forgets what he was like.

(James 1:James 1:25) 
But whoever looks intently into the perfect law of liberty and perseveres in it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer who acts upon it—that man will be blessed in what he does.

(James 1:James 1:26) 
If anyone thinks he is religious, yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is utterly worthless.

(James 1:James 1:27) 
Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world's sinful ways.

(James 2:2:1) 
My beloved brothers, do not act partially, nor show favoritism, as you hold to the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.

(James 2:2:2) 
For if a man wearing an expensive gold ring and splendid attire enters your gathering, and then also a poor man in filthy, worn-out clothing enters,

(James 2:2:3) 
and you focus your attention on the one wearing the splendid clothing, and you say to him, “You, sit here, in a place of honor.” But to the poor man you say, “You, stand over there,” or, “Sit down here on the floor, at my feet.”

(James 2:2:4) 
In doing so, are you not making distinctions among yourselves, and have you not become judges whose very thoughts are evil?

(James 2:2:5) 
Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in the gift of faith, and to be heirs of the Kingdom that God promised to those who love Him?

(James 2:2:6) 
But you, on the other hand, have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by their great power? And is it not they who drag you into court?

(James 2:2:7) 
Do not the rich blaspheme the holy name of God, by which you are known as Christians?

(James 2:2:8) 
If you truly fulfill the royal law, which is the supreme law found in the Scriptures: “You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself”—you are doing well.

(James 2:2:9) 
But if you show partiality to persons, you are committing a sin, and you stand condemned by the law as lawbreakers.

(James 2:2:10) 
For whoever keeps the entire law, yet stumbles in even one command, has become guilty of breaking all of it.

(James 2:2:11) 
For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not kill.” If you do not commit adultery, but you do kill, then you have become a transgressor of the entire law.

(James 2:2:12) 
Therefore, speak in this way and act in this way, understanding that you will be judged by the law that grants true freedom in Christ.

(James 2:2:13) 
For merciless judgment awaits the one who has shown no mercy. However, divine mercy triumphs over judgment itself.

(James 2:2:14) 
What good is it, my beloved brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no good works to show for it? Can that kind of empty faith save him?

(James 2:2:15) 
If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking daily food,

(James 2:2:16) 
and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and well-fed,” yet you do not give them what their bodies truly need—what good is such an empty blessing?

(James 2:2:17) 
In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have good works, is dead and worthless.

(James 2:2:18) 
But someone might say, “You have faith, and I have works.” My answer to him is: “Show me your faith, if it is without any good works to prove it; but I, for my part, will show you my faith through my good works.”

(James 2:2:19) 
You believe that there is only one God. You do well to believe this! Yet, even the demons believe that, and they tremble with fear at His power.

(James 2:2:20) 
But do you wish to know, O man of empty understanding, that faith without good works is truly dead and useless?

(James 2:2:21) 
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by his good works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?

(James 2:2:22) 
You see then that his faith was working together with his good works, and by his good works, his faith was made perfect and complete.

(James 2:2:23) 
And in this way, the Scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham believed God, and his belief was counted to him as righteousness.” And he was called “the Friend of God.”

(James 2:2:24) 
You see then that a man is justified by his good works, and not by faith alone.

(James 2:2:25) 
In the same way, was not Rahab, the harlot, also justified by her good works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different path?

(James 2:2:26) 
For just as the body without a soul is dead, so also faith without good works is dead.

(James 3:1) 
My brothers, do not be eager to become teachers among yourselves, because those who teach will be judged more strictly by God.

(James 3:2) 
For we all stumble and make mistakes in many ways. If someone never makes a mistake with their words, that person is truly a perfect man. Such a one is powerful enough to guide and control their entire body, just as a horse is led by a bridle.

(James 3:3) 
Consider how we put a bridle into a horse's mouth so that it will obey us. With that bridle, we can guide its entire body wherever we wish.

(James 3:4) 
Or consider ships, which are very large and are driven by strong winds. They are steered by a very small rudder, guided by the intention of the pilot.

(James 3:5) 
In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it makes great boasts. Just see how a tiny spark of fire can set an entire forest ablaze!

(James 3:6) 
And the tongue itself is a fire; it is a complete realm of evil. The tongue is set among our body parts, and it can corrupt the entire body. It sets on fire the entire course of our lives and our destiny, because it is ignited by Gehenna—that is, by the forces of hell.

(James 3:7) 
For every kind of wild animal, and of birds, and of serpents, and of all other creatures on land and in the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.

(James 3:8) 
But no one among humanity has the power to tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

(James 3:9) 
With the tongue, we bless God the Father. Yet with the very same tongue, we curse men who are made in the likeness of God Himself.

(James 3:10) 
From the very same mouth comes both blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right that these things should happen this way.

(James 3:11) 
Can a spring pour forth fresh water and bitter water from the same opening at the same time?

(James 3:12) 
My brothers, can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and neither can a spring produce both salty and fresh water from the same source.

(James 3:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is wise and truly understanding? Let that person show their good works by living a good life, demonstrating their actions with the gentleness that comes from true wisdom.

(James 3:14) 
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, then do not boast of your wisdom and do not lie against the truth revealed by God.

(James 3:15) 
For this kind of so-called 'wisdom' does not descend from Heaven, from God. Instead, it is earthly in its origin, unspiritual in its nature, and demonic in its source.

(James 3:16) 
For wherever you find envy and selfish ambition, there you will also find disorder and every kind of evil practice.

(James 3:17) 
But the wisdom that comes from Heaven, from God, is first of all pure. Then it is peaceable, gentle, and willing to yield to what is right. It is full of mercy and produces good fruits, showing no partiality and acting without hypocrisy.

(James 3:18) 
And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace, by those who are peacemakers.

(James 4:1) 
Where do wars and quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this: from your sinful desires, which wage war within your very bodies and souls?

(James 4:2) 
You crave things, and yet you do not have them. You would murder to get them, and you are consumed by envy, yet you still cannot obtain what you want. You quarrel and wage war, yet you do not have what you desire, because you do not ask God for it.

(James 4:3) 
You ask for things, and you do not receive them, because your intentions for asking are evil; you only ask to spend it on your disordered passions.

(James 4:4) 
You spiritually unfaithful people! Do you not know that friendship with this present age is enmity against God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of this world's ways makes himself an enemy of God.

(James 4:5) 
Or do you think that the Scripture speaks in vain when it says: The Holy Spirit who dwells within you yearns jealously for your faithfulness, seeking you solely for Himself?

(James 4:6) 
But God gives even greater grace. This is why it says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

(James 4:7) 
Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

(James 4:8) 
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you who are double-minded and divided in your loyalty.

(James 4:9) 
Be wretched, mourn, and weep over your sins. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.

(James 4:10) 
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.

(James 4:11) 
Brothers, do not speak evil of one another. Whoever speaks evil of his brother, or judges his brother, speaks evil of the Law of God and presumes to judge the Law itself.

(James 4:12) 
But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but its judge.

(James 4:13) 
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, God alone. He has the power to destroy and to save souls.

(James 4:14) 
But who are you, a mere human, to judge your neighbor?

(James 4:15) 
Now listen, you who say: “Today or tomorrow, we will go to such and such a city, and we will spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”:

(James 4:16) 
But you do not even know what tomorrow will bring, or if you will be alive.

(James 4:17) 
What is your life, after all? It is merely a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes into nothingness.

(James 4:18) 
Instead of saying, as you should: “If the Lord wills it, and if we live, we will do this or that.”

(James 4:19) 
But as it is, you boast in your arrogant plans, full of pride and presumption.

(James 4:20) 
All such boasting is evil and inspired by malice against God's Providence.

(James 4:21) 
Therefore, to anyone who knows what is good and right to do, but intentionally does not do it, for him it is a sin.

(James 5:1) 
Now listen, you rich people, and start to wail and cry out, because terrible suffering is coming upon you.

(James 5:2) 
Your accumulated wealth has rotted away, and your fine clothing has been devoured by moths.

(James 5:3) 
Your gold and silver have become corroded and worthless. That very corrosion will stand as evidence against you, and it will consume your bodies as if by fire. You have spent your time hoarding up worldly riches and storing up God's wrath for yourselves in these final days before Christ's return.

(James 5:4) 
Look! The wages of the workers who harvested your crops, wages you fraudulently withheld from them, are now crying out against you. The cries of those workers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts, the God of all armies in heaven and on earth.

(James 5:5) 
You have lived lives of opulent indulgence on earth, and you have fattened your hearts as if for a day of slaughter, oblivious to the coming judgment.

(James 5:6) 
You have condemned and even murdered the righteous, and they offered no resistance to your injustices.

(James 5:7) 
Therefore, be patient, my brothers and sisters, enduring until the Lord's return. Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the valuable produce of the earth. He endures patiently until the ground receives both the early autumn rains for planting and the late spring rains for harvest.

(James 5:8) 
You also must be patient and strengthen your resolve, because the Lord's return is drawing near.

(James 5:9) 
Do not grumble or complain against one another, my brothers and sisters, so that you yourselves will not be judged for it. Remember, the Judge is already standing at the door, ready to enter.

(James 5:10) 
My brothers and sisters, take the prophets, who spoke on behalf of the Lord, as an example of endurance through suffering and of unwavering patience.

(James 5:11) 
Indeed, we acknowledge as blessed those who have patiently endured. You have heard about the steadfast endurance of Job through his trials, and you have seen the Lord’s ultimate purpose in his story, for the Lord is full of mercy and compassion.

(James 5:12) 
But above all, my beloved brothers and sisters, do not swear oaths at all—not by the sky, nor by the earth, nor by any other created thing. Instead, let your simple affirmation be 'yes,' and your simple denial be 'no,' so that you do not fall under the judgment of God.

(James 5:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is suffering hardship or sorrow? Then that person should pray. Is there anyone who is joyful and content? Then that person should sing praises to God.

(James 5:14) 
Is anyone among you gravely ill? That person should call for the priests of the Church, and they should pray over him, anointing him with blessed oil in the Name of the Lord Our God, according to the holy Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

(James 5:15) 
And the prayer offered with sincere faith will bring healing to the sick person, and the Lord will raise him from his affliction. And if he has committed any sins, those sins will be forgiven him.

(James 5:16) 
Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed and saved. For the persistent and fervent prayer of a righteous person has tremendous power before God.

(James 5:17) 
Elijah was a human being just like us, sharing in all our human frailties. Yet he prayed with such fervent prayer that it would not rain on the earth, and indeed, it did not rain for three years and six months.

(James 5:18) 
Then he prayed once more, and the sky gave forth its rain, and the earth produced an abundant harvest of its fruit.

(James 5:19) 
My brothers and sisters, if any of you has strayed from the truth of the Catholic Faith, and someone else brings him back,

(James 5:20) 
that person should know that whoever leads a sinner to repent and turn back from his mistaken path will save that sinner's soul from eternal death and cover a multitude of sins for them both.
