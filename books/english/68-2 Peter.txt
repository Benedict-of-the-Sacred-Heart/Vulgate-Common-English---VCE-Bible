(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:1) 
Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to those who have received the same precious faith that we have, which is given by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ Himself.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:2) 
May grace and peace be multiplied to you through your knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:3) 
Since God's divine power has given us everything we need for a life of virtue and holiness,
this comes through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and power.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:4) 
Through these promises, He has granted us His most great and precious gifts.
These gifts enable you to become partakers of the divine nature,
having escaped the corruption of sinful desires that exists in the world.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:5) 
For this very reason, apply all diligence and effort.
To your faith, add virtue.
To virtue, add knowledge.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:6) 
To knowledge, add self-control.
To self-control, add patience.
To patience, add godliness.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:7) 
To godliness, add brotherly love.
And to brotherly love, add the highest form of love: charity.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:8) 
For if these virtues are present in you and are growing in abundance,
they will ensure you are not idle or unfruitful in your knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:9) 
But anyone who lacks these virtues is spiritually blind and shortsighted.
They have forgotten that they were cleansed from their past sins.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:10) 
Therefore, brothers, strive all the more diligently
to confirm your calling and election by performing good works.
For if you do these things, you will never stumble into sin.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:11) 
For in this way, a rich and abundant entrance will be granted to you
into the eternal heavenly kingdom of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:12) 
Because of this, I will always be ready to remind you of these spiritual truths,
even though you already know them and are firmly established in the present truth.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:13) 
Indeed, I consider it right and proper
that as long as I am in this earthly body—my temporary dwelling—
I should stir you up by constantly reminding you of these things.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:14) 
I know that my time for laying aside this earthly body is coming quickly,
just as Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself revealed to me.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:15) 
I will also take every care and do my utmost
so that even after my death, you may often be able to recall these spiritual truths.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:16) 
We did not make known to you the power and the coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ by following cleverly invented stories or myths.
Instead, we were eyewitnesses of His glorious majesty.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:17) 
For He received honor and glory from God the Father
when a voice came to Him from the magnificent glory of God, saying:
"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:18) 
And we ourselves heard this very voice coming forth from the sky,
when we were with Him on the holy mountain during His Transfiguration.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:19) 
And we possess the prophetic word, which is now even more firm and reliable.
You do well to pay attention to it, just as to a lamp shining in a dark and obscure place.
Pay attention to it until the full light of day breaks forth, and Christ, the Morning Star, arises in your hearts.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:20) 
Know this above all else:
no prophecy in Sacred Scripture comes from a prophet’s own private interpretation.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:21) 
For prophecy was never brought forth by human will or intention.
Instead, holy men of God spoke as they were inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:1) 
However, there were also false prophets among God's people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master, Jesus Christ, who bought them and redeemed them, thereby bringing swift and immediate destruction upon themselves.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:2) 
And many will follow their depraved ways and their licentiousness, through whom the way of truth will be slandered and blasphemed.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:3) 
And out of their greed, they will exploit you for profit with their fabricated stories. For them, judgment, decreed long ago, has not been idle; and their destined destruction does not sleep.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:4) 
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, delivering them into chains of gloom and the lowest part of the underworld to be kept for torment until the final judgment,

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:5) 
and if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, along with seven other people, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:6) 
and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by burning them to ashes, making them an example for those who would live ungodly lives in the future;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:7) 
and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the indecent conduct and corrupt lifestyle of lawless men —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:8) 
for that righteous man, as he lived among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:9) 
then the Lord knows how to rescue the devout from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, to be tormented.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:10) 
This is especially true for those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. They are bold and arrogant, and they do not tremble when they slander glorious beings and heavenly majesties.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:11) 
Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:12) 
But these people, like unreasoning animals, are creatures of mere instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed. They slander what they do not understand, and in their own corruption, they will also perish.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:13) 
They will suffer the penalty for their wrongdoing. They consider luxurious living in broad daylight a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:14) 
Their eyes are full of adultery and never stop sinning. They entice unstable souls, and they have hearts trained in greed. They are children of curse and deserving of divine punishment.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:15) 
They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, son of Bosor, who loved the wages of wickedness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:16) 
But he was rebuked for his transgression: a dumb beast of burden, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:17) 
These men are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm. For them, the deepest gloom of darkness is reserved for all eternity.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:18) 
For, by uttering proud words of emptiness and vainglory, they entice, through sensual desires of the flesh and licentiousness, those who are barely escaping from those who live in error and unbelief.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:19) 
They promise them freedom, though they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by whatever a person is overcome, by that he is enslaved.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:20) 
For if, after escaping the pollutions of the world through the saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, their latter state has become worse for them than the former.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:21) 
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:22) 
What happened to them is described by the true proverb: 'A dog returns to its own vomit,' and, 'A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mud and filth.' 

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:1) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, I am writing this second letter to you. In both of these letters, I am stirring up your sincere minds by reminding you of important truths,

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:2) 
so that you may remember the words that the holy prophets foretold and the commandment given by our Lord and Savior through your Apostles.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:3) 
You should know this first and foremost: that in the last days, deceivers will come to mock you. They will live according to their own sinful desires and lead others into deception.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:4) 
They will say, 'Where is the promise of His coming?' They will claim that since our ancestors died, everything has continued exactly as it was from the very beginning of creation, implying that Christ will not return.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:5) 
They willfully ignore the truth that the universe existed before the Flood, and the earth was formed out of water and structured by water through the creative Word of God.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:6) 
And it was by these very waters that the world of that time was utterly destroyed by the great flood.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:7) 
But the present universe and the earth, by the same divine Word, are being preserved. They are reserved for fire on the Day of Judgment, when all ungodly people will be destroyed.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:8) 
However, beloved brothers and sisters, do not let this one thing escape your notice: that with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. This means that God is not limited by our human perception of time.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:9) 
The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some people consider it slowness. Instead, He is patiently waiting because of you. He does not want anyone to perish, but for all to return to repentance and be saved.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:10) 
But the Day of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. On that Day, the heavens—meaning the created universe—will pass away with a tremendous roar, and the basic elements of matter will be dissolved by intense heat. The earth and all its works and structures will be burned up.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:11) 
Since all these things are to be dissolved in such a way, what kind of people ought you to be in holy conduct and acts of piety, preparing yourselves for that Day?

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:12) 
You should be eagerly awaiting and hastening the coming of the Day of the Lord, the Day by which the burning universe will be dissolved, and the basic elements of all matter will melt away in the fervent heat of the fire.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:13) 
But we eagerly await a new universe and a new earth according to His promise—a creation in which perfect righteousness will permanently dwell.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:14) 
Therefore, beloved brothers and sisters, since you are awaiting these glorious things, strive diligently to be found by Him without any moral stain and blameless, living in peace.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:15) 
And consider the long-suffering patience of our Lord to be for your salvation—a truth that our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you, according to the divine wisdom given to him.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:16) 
He speaks of these matters in all his letters. Some things in his letters are difficult to understand, and these difficult passages are twisted and distorted by ignorant and unstable people, just as they distort the other Holy Scriptures, leading to their own eternal destruction.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:17) 
Therefore, beloved brothers, since you have been forewarned of these things, be on your guard so that you may not be led astray by the error of these foolish people and fall from your own steadfastness in the faith.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:18) 
Instead, grow in the grace and in the full, saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be all glory, both now and for the Day of eternity. Amen.
