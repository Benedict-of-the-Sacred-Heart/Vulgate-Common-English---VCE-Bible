(Leviticus 1:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses inside the Tabernacle of Testimony, saying:

(Leviticus 1:2) 
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When any person among you offers a sacrifice to the Lord, you must offer it from your livestock—either from your cattle or from your sheep.

(Leviticus 1:3) 
If his offering is a burnt offering from his herd of cattle, he must present a perfect male animal at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony. This is so his offering will be acceptable to the Lord, making atonement for him.

(Leviticus 1:4) 
He will lay his hand on the head of the animal offered for sacrifice, and this act will make it acceptable, thereby providing atonement for him.

(Leviticus 1:5) 
Then he must slaughter the young bull before the Lord. Aaron's sons, the priests, will offer its blood by sprinkling it all around the altar, which stands at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Leviticus 1:6) 
After skinning the animal offered for sacrifice, they will cut it into its individual pieces.

(Leviticus 1:7) 
They will then place fire upon the altar, after arranging wood on it beforehand.

(Leviticus 1:8) 
And on top of the wood and fire, they will arrange the cut pieces, including the head and all the internal fat that adheres to the liver.

(Leviticus 1:9) 
However, the internal organs and the legs must be washed with water. Then the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:10) 
If the burnt offering is from the flock—either from the sheep or the goats—he must offer a perfect male animal without blemish.

(Leviticus 1:11) 
He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar, before the Lord. Aaron’s sons will then sprinkle its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 1:12) 
After cutting it into pieces, they will arrange the head and all the internal fat adhering to the liver on top of the wood, which has been placed on the fire.

(Leviticus 1:13) 
However, the internal organs and the legs must be washed with water. Then the priest will offer all of it and burn it on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:14) 
If his burnt offering to the Lord is from birds—either turtledoves or young pigeons—

(Leviticus 1:15) 
The priest will bring it to the altar. He will wring its neck to break it and then burn it on the altar, pressing its head against the side of the altar.

(Leviticus 1:16) 
He will open the bird and remove its crop and its contents, not burning them, and throw them beside the altar on the east side, in the place where the ashes are usually placed.

(Leviticus 1:17) 
He will tear its wings, but not separate them entirely from the body, and then burn the bird on the altar, upon the wood and the fire. This is a burnt offering, an offering of a most pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:18) 
When a person presents a grain offering as a sacrifice, his offering to the Lord must be fine flour.

(Leviticus 1:19) 
He will pour olive oil on it and put frankincense on it, then bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests.

(Leviticus 1:20) 
When the priest receives it, he will take a handful as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar; it is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:21) 
Whatever remains of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is a most holy portion from the Lord’s offerings.

(Leviticus 1:22) 
When you offer a grain offering baked in an oven, it must consist of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.

(Leviticus 1:23) 
If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened fine flour mixed with oil.

(Leviticus 1:24) 
You will break it into pieces and pour oil over it.

(Leviticus 1:25) 
If your grain offering is prepared in a pan, it must be fine flour mixed with oil.

(Leviticus 1:26) 
The priests will take a portion of it as a memorial and burn it on the altar; it is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:27) 
Whatever remains will belong to Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion from the Lord’s offerings.

(Leviticus 1:28) 
If a person sins unintentionally by doing something forbidden by the Lord's Law, and thus becomes guilty, even if they were unaware of the transgression at the time:

(Leviticus 1:29) 
He must offer a perfect young bull from the herd to the Lord as a sin offering, and he will bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, to the priest.

(Leviticus 1:30) 
He will lay his hand on the head of the young bull and slaughter it before the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:31) 
The priest will then sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 1:32) 
He will remove all the fat that covers the internal organs, and all the fat that is attached to the liver.

(Leviticus 1:33) 
Just as the fat is removed from peace offerings, he will remove it and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:34) 
The priest will pray for him, making intercession for his sin, and it will be forgiven him.

(Leviticus 1:35) 
If his sin offering is a goat from the flock, he must offer a perfect female goat.

(Leviticus 1:36) 
He will lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed, before the Lord.

(Leviticus 1:37) 
The priest will sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 1:38) 
He will remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. The priest will pray for him, and it will be forgiven him.

(Leviticus 1:39) 
If he offers a lamb as his sin offering, he must offer a perfect male lamb.

(Leviticus 1:40) 
He will lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed. The priest will sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 2:1) 
When a person offers a sacrificial offering to the Lord, that offering must be of fine flour — a grain offering.

(Leviticus 2:2) 
And the person must pour oil over the fine flour, and then put frankincense on it, and bring it to the sons of Aaron, who are the priests.

(Leviticus 2:3) 
One of the priests will take a handful of the fine flour and oil, along with all the frankincense, and burn it on the altar as a memorial portion. This offering is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 2:4) 
But whatever remains from the offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is considered most holy, taken from the Lord’s offerings.

(Leviticus 2:5) 
When you offer a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers brushed with oil.

(Leviticus 2:6) 
If your offering is prepared on a griddle, it must be of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened.

(Leviticus 2:7) 
After it is cut into pieces, you must pour oil over it.

(Leviticus 2:8) 
If the offering is prepared on a baking pan, it must be of fine flour mixed with oil.

(Leviticus 2:9) 
You will bring these offerings to the Lord through the hands of a priest. When the first priest presents it, he will hand it over to another priest.

(Leviticus 2:10) 
This priest will then take a memorial portion from it and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 2:11) 
Whatever remains from this offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is considered most holy, taken from the Lord’s offerings.

(Leviticus 2:12) 
Every grain offering presented to the Lord must be made without leaven. You must not burn any honey in an offering made to the Lord.

(Leviticus 2:13) 
Whatever you offer as firstfruits to the Lord, you must bring as a new offering. But it will not be burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma.

(Leviticus 2:14) 
You must season every one of your offerings with salt. Do not omit the salt of the covenant of your God from your offering. You must offer salt with every single offering you make.

(Leviticus 2:15) 
If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits of grain to the Lord, you must offer roasted heads of grain and crushed new grain as the beginning of your offering.

(Leviticus 2:16) 
Over this, you must pour oil and put frankincense, because it is an offering to the Lord.

(Leviticus 3:1) 
If someone brings a peace offering—an offering made to establish communion with God or give thanks—and chooses to offer an animal from his cattle, whether it is a male or a female, he must present it to the Lord without any physical defect.

(Leviticus 3:2) 
And he shall place his hand upon the head of his sacrificial animal. This animal will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron, who are priests, shall drain its blood and sprinkle it all around the altar.

(Leviticus 3:3) 
From this peace offering, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord the fat that covers the animal's internal organs, including all the fatty tissue surrounding these organs.

(Leviticus 3:4) 
He shall also offer the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.

(Leviticus 3:5) 
The sons of Aaron shall then burn these parts on the altar, placing them on top of the burnt offering that is already laid upon the wood and the fire. This is an offering by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 3:6) 
If his offering is from the flock—that is, if he offers a peace offering from the sheep, whether it is a male or a female—he must present it without blemish.

(Leviticus 3:7) 
If he offers a lamb, he must follow the same procedures described above for cattle.

(Leviticus 3:8) 
He shall lay his hand upon the head of his sacrificial animal, which will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 3:9) 
From the peace offering, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord its fat, including the entire fat tail, cut off close to the backbone. He shall also offer the fat that covers the internal organs.

(Leviticus 3:10) 
And the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.

(Leviticus 3:11) 
The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar. This is the food of the offering by fire to the Lord.

(Leviticus 3:12) 
If his offering is a goat, he must present it without blemish.

(Leviticus 3:13) 
He shall lay his hand upon its head, and it will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around the altar.

(Leviticus 3:14) 
From it, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord its fat, including the fat that covers the internal organs, and all the fatty tissue surrounding these organs.

(Leviticus 3:15) 
And the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.

(Leviticus 3:16) 
The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar as food for the offering by fire, for a pleasing aroma. For all the fat belongs to the Lord.

(Leviticus 3:17) 
This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations and in all your dwelling places: you shall eat no fat and no blood.

(Leviticus 4:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 4:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel: If a person sins unintentionally, doing something that the Lord has forbidden in His commandments, and does not realize it at the time, then this is what they must do:

(Leviticus 4:3) 
If the High Priest—the one who has been anointed—sins in a way that brings guilt upon the people, he must offer a young, unblemished bull to the Lord as a sacrifice for his own sin.

(Leviticus 4:4) 
He must bring the young bull to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, before the Lord. He shall place his hand upon its head and slaughter it there before the Lord.

(Leviticus 4:5) 
Then he must take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tabernacle of the Testimony.

(Leviticus 4:6) 
He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times towards the veil of the sanctuary.

(Leviticus 4:7) 
And he must put some of that same blood on the horns of the altar of pleasing incense before the Lord, which is inside the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which stands at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Leviticus 4:8) 
Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull offered for sin: the fat that covers the intestines, and all the fat on the intestines,

(Leviticus 4:9) 
and both kidneys with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.

(Leviticus 4:10) 
He shall remove these, just as it is removed from a young bull offered as a sacrifice of peace, and burn them on the altar for burnt offerings.

(Leviticus 4:11) 
But the bull's hide, all its meat along with its head and legs, its intestines, and its dung,

(Leviticus 4:12) 
the entire bull, he must carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are usually poured out. He shall burn it with fire on a pile of wood in that clean place, outside the camp.

(Leviticus 4:13) 
Now, if the entire congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and through lack of attention does something against the Lord's commandment,

(Leviticus 4:14) 
and later realizes its sin, the community must offer a young bull as a sacrifice for sin, and bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.

(Leviticus 4:15) 
Then the elders of the community shall place their hands on its head before the Lord and slaughter it there.

(Leviticus 4:16) 
The High Priest, who is anointed, must carry some of the bull's blood into the Tabernacle of the Testimony.

(Leviticus 4:17) 
He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times towards the veil.

(Leviticus 4:18) 
And he shall put some of that same blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord inside the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Leviticus 4:19) 
Then he must remove all its fat and burn it on the altar.

(Leviticus 4:20) 
He shall do to this young bull just as he did to the previous one. And when the priest intercedes for them, the Lord will forgive them.

(Leviticus 4:21) 
The young bull itself he shall carry outside the camp and burn, just as I commanded before.

(Leviticus 4:22) 
If a ruler sins unintentionally, doing something against any of the commandments of the Lord his God, and afterwards realizes his guilt,

(Leviticus 4:23) 
he must offer a male goat, unblemished, as a sacrifice.

(Leviticus 4:24) 
He shall place his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed before the Lord, because it is a sacrifice for sin.

(Leviticus 4:25) 
Then the priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the sacrifice and put some of it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, pouring the rest at its base.

(Leviticus 4:26) 
But he shall burn all its fat on the altar, just as with a burnt offering. And when the priest intercedes for him, the Lord will forgive him for his sin.

(Leviticus 4:27) 
If an ordinary person from the common people sins unintentionally, doing something forbidden by the Lord’s law, and thus incurs guilt,

(Leviticus 4:28) 
and afterwards realizes their sin, they must offer an unblemished female goat as a sacrifice.

(Leviticus 4:29) 
They shall place their hand on the head of the sacrifice for sin and slaughter it in the place of the burnt offering.

(Leviticus 4:30) 
Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and pour the rest at its base.

(Leviticus 4:31) 
And he shall remove all its fat, just as fat is removed from peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. And when the priest intercedes for the person, the Lord will forgive them.

(Leviticus 4:32) 
If someone offers a male lamb without blemish as a sacrifice for sin,

(Leviticus 4:33) 
they shall place their hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually slaughtered.

(Leviticus 4:34) 
Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and pour the rest at its base.

(Leviticus 4:35) 
And he shall remove all its fat, just as it is removed from the ram sacrificed for peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as an incense to the Lord. And when the priest intercedes for the person, the Lord will forgive them for the sin they committed.

(Leviticus 5:1) 
If a person commits a sin by not speaking up,
after they have heard a public oath or adjuration
calling for witnesses to testify,
and they themselves were a witness
to something they saw or knew,
but they failed to report what they knew,
then that person will be held accountable for their sin.

(Leviticus 5:2) 
Or if a person touches anything ritually unclean—
whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal,
or the carcass of an unclean domestic animal,
or the carcass of an unclean crawling creature—
and they were initially unaware of the ritual impurity,
but then later remember and realize it,
that person becomes ritually unclean and is guilty of sin.

(Leviticus 5:3) 
Or if a person touches human uncleanness,
any kind of ritual impurity by which a person normally becomes defiled,
and they were initially unaware of it,
but then later remember and realize it,
that person will be guilty.

(Leviticus 5:4) 
Or if a person acts sinfully by making a rash vow—
swearing with their lips to do something, whether good or bad,
or making any other kind of sworn promise—
and then they forget about it,
but afterwards realize their failure to keep it,
that person has committed a transgression.

(Leviticus 5:5) 
Therefore, whoever commits a sin in any of these ways
must confess their sin.

(Leviticus 5:6) 
And they shall offer for their sin to the Lord
a female animal from the flock, either a lamb or a goat.
And the priest will then make atonement for that person, for their sin.

(Leviticus 5:7) 
But if the person cannot afford to offer an animal from the flock,
then they shall offer to the Lord two turtledoves or two young pigeons:
one as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering to God.

(Leviticus 5:8) 
The priest shall offer the first bird as the sin offering,
wringing its head at the neck, but without fully detaching it.

(Leviticus 5:9) 
And he shall sprinkle some of its blood on the side of the altar,
but the remaining blood shall be drained at the base of the altar,
because this is a sin offering.

(Leviticus 5:10) 
But the other bird he shall prepare as a burnt offering,
according to the usual ritual.
Then the priest will make atonement for that person, for their sin,
and they will be forgiven.

(Leviticus 5:11) 
But if the person cannot afford to offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
then for their sin, they shall offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour.
It must be offered without olive oil and without frankincense,
because it is a sin offering.

(Leviticus 5:12) 
And the person shall bring it to the priest,
who, taking a handful of it, will set it aside as a memorial portion,
and then burn it on the altar as a portion for the Lord.

(Leviticus 5:13) 
Thus the priest will make atonement for that person,
for the sin they committed, and they will be forgiven.
The remainder of the offering, however, will belong to the priest as his portion.

(Leviticus 5:14) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 5:15) 
If a person commits a transgression and, by mistake,
unknowingly acts against what is consecrated to the Lord—
for this trespass, they shall offer an unblemished ram from the flock
as a guilt offering,
valued at two just shekels according to the sanctuary standard.

(Leviticus 5:16) 
And if the person has caused any loss concerning consecrated things,
they must make full restitution for that loss,
and add a fifth part (twenty percent) to it,
giving it to the priest.
Then the priest will make atonement for them by offering the ram.

(Leviticus 5:17) 
If a person commits a sin by mistake,
unknowingly doing something that is forbidden by the Lord's Law,
and later becomes aware of their transgression,
that person will still bear the guilt of their sin.

(Leviticus 5:18) 
And they shall bring an unblemished ram from the flock to the priest,
valued appropriately for the trespass.
Then the priest will make atonement for that person for their unintentional sin,
because they acted unknowingly, and they will be forgiven.

(Leviticus 5:19) 
This is for an unintentional transgression against the Lord.

(Leviticus 5:20) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 5:21) 
If a person commits a sin, and thereby shows contempt for the Lord,
by denying to their neighbor a deposit that had been entrusted to their care,
or by violently taking what belongs to another,
or by committing fraud,

(Leviticus 5:22) 
or by denying that they found something lost,
and then swearing a false oath about it—
whatever the specific thing for which they have sinned,

(Leviticus 5:23) 
when they are guilty of such a trespass,
they must restore everything they took away by any kind of fraud,
and add a fifth part (twenty percent) to it,
giving it back to the owner whom they defrauded.

(Leviticus 5:24) 
And for their sin, they shall offer an unblemished ram from the flock to the Lord,
giving it to the priest,
valued appropriately for the measure and estimation of the sin.

(Leviticus 5:25) 
Then the priest will make atonement for them before the Lord,
and they will be forgiven for whatever sin they have committed in any of these cases.

(Leviticus 5:26) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 6:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 6:2) 
If a person sins by acting contemptuously toward the Lord, for example, by denying a deposit left with them by their neighbor, or by extorting something by force, or by committing fraud,

(Leviticus 6:3) 
or if they have denied finding something, and then sworn a false oath concerning it; or if they have done anything else from all the ways that a person typically commits sin:

(Leviticus 6:4) 
once they are found guilty of this wickedness, they must return everything they gained through deceit. They must also add an additional fifth part to it, giving this total amount to the priest, as compensation for what they unjustly took.

(Leviticus 6:5) 
And for their specific sin, they shall offer a perfect ram, without blemish, from the flock. They will give this ram to the priest for atonement, according to its assessed value and the prescribed manner of expiation.

(Leviticus 6:6) 
The priest will then pray for them before the Lord. After this, whatever sin they have committed will be forgiven them.

(Leviticus 6:7) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 6:8) 
Command Aaron and his sons this: This is the law for the burnt offering, also known as the holocaust. The burnt offering is the sacrifice that is completely consumed by fire on the altar, burning from evening throughout the night until morning. The fire for this offering must always be kept burning on the altar.

(Leviticus 6:9) 
The officiating priest shall put on his sacred linen tunic and linen breeches. Then he shall gather the ashes from the burnt offering—the ashes that the sacrificial fire has consumed—and pour them next to the altar.

(Leviticus 6:10) 
After this, he must change into different garments, and then carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.

(Leviticus 6:11) 
The fire on the altar must always be kept burning; it shall never be allowed to go out. Every morning, the priest shall add wood to it and arrange the burnt offering on top. Then he will burn the fat of the peace offerings upon it.

(Leviticus 6:12) 
This fire is to be perpetual; it shall never be allowed to fail or go out on the altar.

(Leviticus 6:13) 
This is the law for the sin offering. The animal for this offering must be slaughtered in the very place where the burnt offering is sacrificed, before the Lord. This sacrifice is considered most holy.

(Leviticus 6:14) 
The priest who eats of this offering must observe the ritual laws. If any of its flesh should accidentally touch his garment, that garment must be washed in a holy place to purify it.

(Leviticus 6:15) 
Any clay vessel in which the offering has been cooked must be broken afterward. But if it is a bronze vessel, it shall be thoroughly scoured and washed with water.

(Leviticus 6:16) 
Every male descendant of the priestly family may eat of this offering, because it is considered most holy.

(Leviticus 6:17) 
However, any sin offering whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting—the tabernacle of testimony—to make atonement within the sanctuary, shall not be eaten. Instead, it must be completely consumed by fire.

(Leviticus 6:18) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 6:19) 
This is the special grain offering that Aaron and his sons must offer to the Lord on the day of their anointing: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a perpetual grain offering to be made regularly.

(Leviticus 6:20) 
Half of this offering shall be presented in the morning, and the other half in the evening.

(Leviticus 6:21) 
It shall be prepared in a pan, mixed with oil, and fried. After you have divided it into suitable portions and pieces, you shall offer it as a burnt offering, a truly pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 6:22) 
The priest who succeeds his father and is anointed with the same sacred ritual shall perform this offering in the same way. This is an eternal, prescribed law for the Lord alone. The entirety of this offering must be consumed by fire.

(Leviticus 6:23) 
Every grain offering made by a priest shall be completely consumed by fire; it shall never be eaten.

(Leviticus 6:24) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 6:25) 
Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law for the sin offering. The animal for this offering shall be slaughtered in the very same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, before the Lord. This sacrifice is considered most holy.

(Leviticus 6:26) 
The priest who presents this offering for sin shall eat it in a holy place—specifically, in the court of the Tent of Meeting, which is the tabernacle of testimony.

(Leviticus 6:27) 
Whatever touches the flesh of the offering shall become holy. If any of its blood is sprinkled on a garment, that part of the garment must be washed in a holy place.

(Leviticus 6:28) 
Any clay vessel in which the offering has been cooked must be broken. But if it is a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured and then rinsed thoroughly with water.

(Leviticus 6:29) 
Every male from the priestly family may eat of it, because it is considered most holy.

(Leviticus 6:30) 
However, any sin offering—any victim whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting, which is the tabernacle of testimony, to make atonement in the sanctuary—shall not be eaten. Instead, it must be completely consumed by fire.

(Leviticus 7:1) 
These are the laws for the sin offering, which is most holy.

(Leviticus 7:2) 
Just as with the burnt offering, the sin offering is to be sacrificed in the place where the burnt offering is killed. Its blood is to be poured out all around the altar.

(Leviticus 7:3) 
They must offer all its fat: the fat tail (especially prominent in certain sheep breeds), the fat covering the entrails, both kidneys with the fat that covers them, and the fatty lobe of the liver, which is typically removed along with the kidneys.

(Leviticus 7:4) 
The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, an offering for sin.

(Leviticus 7:5) 
Every male in the priestly family is permitted to eat its flesh in a holy place, because this offering is most holy.

(Leviticus 7:6) 
The same rules apply to the trespass (or guilt) offering: it is most holy, and it belongs to the priests.

(Leviticus 7:7) 
The priest who presents it as an offering is the one who shall eat it.

(Leviticus 7:8) 
Whenever a burnt offering is made, the hide of the animal, which is not burned, shall belong to the priest whose hand poured out its blood.

(Leviticus 7:9) 
Every grain offering that is baked in the oven, or prepared on the griddle, or in a pan, shall belong to the priest who offers it.

(Leviticus 7:10) 
Any grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall be given to all the sons of Aaron in equal shares.

(Leviticus 7:11) 
This is the law for the peace offering that is presented to the Lord.

(Leviticus 7:12) 
If someone offers it as a thank offering, they must present unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour fried with oil, along with thin cakes mixed with oil.

(Leviticus 7:13) 
They must also offer leavened loaves along with the thank offering, which is sacrificed as part of the peace offerings.

(Leviticus 7:14) 
From each kind of bread, they shall present one loaf to the Lord as a heave offering for the firstfruits. These loaves will then belong to the priest who pours out the animal’s blood.

(Leviticus 7:15) 
The flesh of the peace offering, which is sacrificed as a thank offering, must be eaten on the very same day it is offered. Nothing from it may be left until the next morning.

(Leviticus 7:16) 
If the offering is made because of a vow, or as a freewill offering, and not as a thank offering, then it may be eaten on the day it is offered, but any remaining portion may be eaten on the second day.

(Leviticus 7:17) 
But any part of the offering that is left over by the third day must be completely burned with fire.

(Leviticus 7:18) 
If anyone eats the flesh of the peace offering on the third day, the offering will not be accepted, and it will bring no benefit to the one who presented it. Furthermore, any person who partakes of such defiled meat shall be held guilty of a serious transgression against God’s law.

(Leviticus 7:19) 
Any meat that touches something unclean must not be eaten; instead, it must be completely burned with fire. Whoever eats of such defiled meat will become unclean themselves.

(Leviticus 7:20) 
However, if the meat itself is clean, but a person who is ritually unclean eats from it, that person will be cut off from their people and their spiritual lineage.

(Leviticus 7:21) 
And if a person touches human uncleanness, or the uncleanness of any animal, or anything else that can defile, and then eats from the flesh of these peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from their people.

(Leviticus 7:22) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 7:23) 
Say to the children of Israel: 'You must not eat the fat from any ox, sheep, or goat.'

(Leviticus 7:24) 
The fat from an animal that dies naturally or is torn by wild beasts may be used for other practical purposes (such as making soap or fuel for lamps), but it is absolutely forbidden for food.

(Leviticus 7:25) 
If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which a fire offering is made to the Lord, that person shall be cut off from their people.

(Leviticus 7:26) 
Moreover, in all your settlements, you must not eat any blood from any creature that has flesh.

(Leviticus 7:27) 
Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from their people.

(Leviticus 7:28) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 7:29) 
Say to the children of Israel: 'Whoever brings a peace offering to the Lord must present his offering to the Lord from what he has brought, as a gift from his own hands (this refers to the ritual of the wave offering).

(Leviticus 7:30) 
With his own hands, he must bring the fat (which is burned as a pleasing aroma) and the breast, which have been separated from the rest of the meat, to be presented to the Lord as a fire offering.

(Leviticus 7:31) 
The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast portion of the animal is to belong to Aaron and his sons.

(Leviticus 7:32) 
Furthermore, the right thigh (often referred to as the shoulder or upper arm in other contexts) from the peace offerings shall be given to the priest as his priestly portion.

(Leviticus 7:33) 
The priest who offers the blood and the fat of the peace offering shall receive the right thigh as his own share.

(Leviticus 7:34) 
For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering from the children of Israel, from their peace offerings. I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their perpetual due, by an everlasting statute.

(Leviticus 7:35) 
This is the priestly due and portion for Aaron and his sons from the offerings made to the Lord, given to them on the day they were brought forward to serve as priests.

(Leviticus 7:36) 
The Lord commanded these portions to be given to them by the children of Israel as a religious observance, to be upheld forever.

(Leviticus 7:37) 
These are the laws concerning the burnt offering, the sin offering, the trespass (or guilt) offering, the consecration offering for priests, and the peace offerings.

(Leviticus 7:38) 
These are the laws that the Lord established for Moses on Mount Sinai, when He commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai.

(Leviticus 8:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 8:2) 
“Gather Aaron and his sons, along with the sacred garments, the anointing oil, a calf for the sin offering, a ram for the burnt offering, and a basket filled with unleavened bread.

(Leviticus 8:3) 
Then you shall assemble the entire congregation at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Meeting.”

(Leviticus 8:4) 
So Moses did everything the Lord had commanded. And all the congregation gathered at the entrance.

(Leviticus 8:5) 
Moses said to the assembly: “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.”

(Leviticus 8:6) 
Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward. He washed them with water,

(Leviticus 8:7) 
and he clothed Aaron, the High Priest, with the tunic. He wrapped the sash around him, put the robe on him, and then placed the ephod on him.

(Leviticus 8:8) 
He fastened the woven band of the ephod to Aaron’s shoulder and secured the breastplate with its own artistic sash.

(Leviticus 8:9) 
He put the breastplate on Aaron, which contained the Urim and Thummim (the “Lights and Perfections” for divine revelation). He placed the turban on Aaron’s head, and on the front of the turban, he affixed the golden plate—the holy diadem, just as the Lord had commanded him.

(Leviticus 8:10) 
Then Moses took the anointing oil and consecrated the Tabernacle and all its furnishings by anointing them.

(Leviticus 8:11) 
After consecrating them, he sprinkled the altar seven times, anointing it and all its utensils to consecrate them fully.

(Leviticus 8:12) 
He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, setting him apart for his sacred office.

(Leviticus 8:13) 
Moses then brought Aaron’s sons forward and clothed them with tunics, sashed them with sashes, and placed headbands on them, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Leviticus 8:14) 
Next, he brought the calf for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the calf,

(Leviticus 8:15) 
and Moses slaughtered it. Taking some of the blood, he put his finger into it and touched the horns of the altar all around, purifying it. He then poured the remaining blood at the base of the altar, thereby consecrating it to make atonement for it.

(Leviticus 8:16) 
He took all the fat covering the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat, and burned them up in smoke on the altar.

(Leviticus 8:17) 
But the hide, the meat, and the dung of the calf he burned outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Leviticus 8:18) 
Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.

(Leviticus 8:19) 
When Moses had slaughtered it, he sprinkled the blood around all sides of the altar.

(Leviticus 8:20) 
He cut the ram into pieces, and then burned the head, the pieces, and the fat in smoke upon the altar.

(Leviticus 8:21) 
After washing the entrails and the legs, Moses burned the entire ram on the altar. This was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.

(Leviticus 8:22) 
Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination for the priests. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.

(Leviticus 8:23) 
When Moses had slaughtered it, he took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

(Leviticus 8:24) 
He then brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the remaining blood on the lobe of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. The rest of the blood he sprinkled around the altar.

(Leviticus 8:25) 
He then took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that covered the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, both kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.

(Leviticus 8:26) 
From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened loaf, one cake of bread mixed with oil, and one wafer. He placed all these on top of the fat portions and the right thigh.

(Leviticus 8:27) 
He put all these items together into the hands of Aaron and his sons. They presented them as a wave offering before the Lord.

(Leviticus 8:28) 
Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them up in smoke on the altar, on top of the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 8:29) 
Moses also took the breast from the ram of ordination as his own portion, just as the Lord had commanded him.

(Leviticus 8:30) 
Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and their garments all around. In this way, he consecrated them and their garments.

(Leviticus 8:31) 
Moses then said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Meeting, and eat it there, along with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat them.’

(Leviticus 8:32) 
Whatever remains of the meat and the bread you shall burn with fire.”

(Leviticus 8:33) 
You shall not go outside the entrance of the Tabernacle for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed. For seven days you will be ordained by God himself.

(Leviticus 8:34) 
What has been done today is to complete the ritual; it will be done again tomorrow.

(Leviticus 8:35) 
You shall remain at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days, keeping the Lord’s charge, so that you do not die. For this is what I have been commanded.”

(Leviticus 8:36) 
So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses.

(Leviticus 9:1) 
It happened on the eighth day—the day after their seven-day consecration period—Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel, and spoke to them.

(Leviticus 9:2) 
And Moses said to Aaron: 'Take a young bull from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. Both must be without any blemish, and you must offer them before the Lord.'

(Leviticus 9:3) 
Then you, Aaron, must speak to the sons of Israel, saying: 'Take a male goat from the flock for a sin offering, and a yearling calf and a yearling lamb, both without blemish, for a burnt offering.'

(Leviticus 9:4) 
Also, take an ox and a ram for peace offerings, both without blemish, so that they may be sacrificed before the Lord. And include fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering. For all these things will be offered before the Lord today.

(Leviticus 9:5) 
So they brought all the things that Moses had commanded to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, and the whole assembly stood there.

(Leviticus 9:6) 
And Moses said: 'This is the very thing the Lord has commanded you to do. Perform these rituals, and the glorious presence of the Lord will become visible to you.'

(Leviticus 9:7) 
Then Moses said to Aaron: 'Approach the altar, and offer your own sin offering and your burnt offering. Make intercession for yourself and for the people. After that, offer the people's offering, just as the Lord has commanded.'

(Leviticus 9:8) 
Immediately, Aaron approached the altar and sacrificed the young bull for his own sin offering.

(Leviticus 9:9) 
And his sons brought the blood to him. He dipped his finger into the blood, touched the horns of the altar, and then poured the remaining blood at the base of the altar.

(Leviticus 9:10) 
Then, from the sin offering, he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver upon the altar.

(Leviticus 9:11) 
However, the animal's flesh, its hide, its head, its legs, and its entrails—he burned these outside the camp, utterly consuming them.

(Leviticus 9:12) 
He also sacrificed the burnt offering according to the prescribed ritual. His sons brought him the blood, which he then poured all around the perimeter of the altar.

(Leviticus 9:13) 
But the offering itself—that is, the pieces of the animal, its head, and each individual limb—he completely consumed with fire upon the altar.

(Leviticus 9:14) 
He also washed the entrails and the legs with water, and then burned them together upon the altar.

(Leviticus 9:15) 
Then Aaron presented the people's offering. He took the male goat that was designated for their sins and sacrificed it, thereby purifying the altar through this ritual.

(Leviticus 9:16) 
He also brought the burnt offering and placed it upon the altar, performing the ritual precisely as it is prescribed in the ceremonies.

(Leviticus 9:17) 
He also presented the grain offering, which consisted of fine flour mixed with olive oil. He took a handful of it and burned it upon the altar, separate from the burnt offering.

(Leviticus 9:18) 
Then he sacrificed the ox and the ram as peace offerings for the people. His sons brought him the blood, which he poured all around the altar.

(Leviticus 9:19) 
But the fat portions of the oxen and the rams, along with their fatty tails, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver—all these parts came from the peace offerings.

(Leviticus 9:20) 
They placed these fatty parts on top of the priests' portion of the breasts. Then, when they burned all the fat portions on the altar,

(Leviticus 9:21) 
Aaron set aside the breasts along with the right thigh as a priestly portion—a wave offering presented before the Lord, just as Moses had been commanded.

(Leviticus 9:22) 
Then Aaron raised his hands towards the people and blessed them. After descending from the altar, he completed the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.

(Leviticus 9:23) 
After this, Moses and Aaron entered the Tabernacle of Testimony. When they came out, they blessed the people, and immediately, the glorious presence of the Lord became visible to the entire assembly.

(Leviticus 9:24) 
And behold, fire miraculously came forth from the Lord's presence and instantly consumed both the burnt offering and the fat portions that were on the altar. When everyone witnessed this, they all shouted together in praise to the Lord, falling prostrate on their faces in reverence.

(Leviticus 10:1) 
Then Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s sons, took their censers. They put fire into the censers and placed incense upon that fire. This act was an unauthorized offering before the Lord, a type of fire that God had not commanded them to use in worship.

(Leviticus 10:2) 
Immediately, a fire came directly from the Lord and consumed them. They died in the presence of the Lord.

(Leviticus 10:3) 
Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is the meaning of what the Lord declared: 'I will be recognized as holy by those who draw near to me in worship, and before all the people, I will be glorified.'" When Aaron heard this, he remained silent, understanding God's judgment.

(Leviticus 10:4) 
Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, who were the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel. He told them, "Go and carry your kinsmen away from the front of the holy place, and take them outside the camp for burial."

(Leviticus 10:5) 
They immediately took them, still in their priestly tunics, and carried them outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded.

(Leviticus 10:6) 
Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons: "Do not uncover your heads, and do not tear your garments in mourning. Do not do this, lest you yourselves die and the Lord’s anger come upon all the congregation. Instead, let your relatives and all the house of Israel mourn the burning which the Lord has sent."

(Leviticus 10:7) 
"And you yourselves must not leave the entrance of the tabernacle. Do not leave, lest you die, because the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you." So they did everything according to Moses’ command.

(Leviticus 10:8) 
The Lord also spoke to Aaron, saying:

(Leviticus 10:9) 
"You, and your sons with you, must not drink wine or any intoxicating drink when you enter the tent of meeting. If you do, you will die. This is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations."

(Leviticus 10:10) 
"This command is given so that you may distinguish between what is holy and what is not holy, and between what is defiled and what is clean."

(Leviticus 10:11) 
"And it is so that you may teach the children of Israel all My statutes which the Lord has spoken to them through Moses."

(Leviticus 10:12) 
Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons: "Take the grain offering that remains from the Lord's offerings and eat it without leaven beside the altar. Do this because it is most holy."

(Leviticus 10:13) 
"You shall eat it in a holy place, for it has been given to you and your sons as your portion from the sacrifices of the Lord."

(Leviticus 10:14) 
"Also, the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented as a heave offering, you, your sons, and your daughters with you, shall eat in any clean place. For these are assigned to you and to your sons and daughters as your due portion from the peace offerings of the children of Israel."

(Leviticus 10:15) 
"The thigh and the breast are your due because they are the offerings of elevation and separation, which are presented before the Lord. These belong to you and your sons by a perpetual statute, just as the Lord has commanded."

(Leviticus 10:16) 
Moses carefully inquired about the goat that had been offered for the sin offering, and he found that it had been burned completely. Being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, he said:

(Leviticus 10:17) 
"Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place? It is most holy, and it was given to you to remove the iniquity of the congregation and to make atonement for them before the Lord."

(Leviticus 10:18) 
"Its blood was not brought inside the holy place and into the sanctuary, so you should have eaten it in the holy place, as it was commanded."

(Leviticus 10:19) 
Aaron answered Moses: "Indeed, today a sin offering and a burnt offering have been presented before the Lord. But you know what misfortunes have happened to me this day – the death of my sons. If I had eaten its flesh today, would it have pleased the Lord?"

(Leviticus 10:20) 
When Moses heard this, he immediately approved.

(Leviticus 11:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them:

(Leviticus 11:2) 
Speak to the children of Israel. These are the living creatures you are permitted to eat from all the animals on the earth.

(Leviticus 11:3) 
Any animal that has a hoof which is divided—that is, split into two separate parts—and that also chews the cud, you are permitted to eat.

(Leviticus 11:4) 
But any creature that chews the cud yet does not have a divided hoof, such as the camel and similar animals, will be considered ritually unclean for you.

(Leviticus 11:5) 
The rock badger—a creature that chews the cud but does not have a divided hoof—is ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 11:6) 
Likewise, the rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof, and so it is ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 11:7) 
The pig, too, has a divided hoof but does not chew the cud, and so it is ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 11:8) 
You are not permitted to eat the meat of these animals, nor are you permitted to touch their dead bodies, for they are ritually unclean for you.

(Leviticus 11:9) 
These are the kinds of creatures you are permitted to eat from all the living things that dwell in the waters: Anything that has fins and scales, whether in the sea, in rivers, or in ponds, you are permitted to eat.

(Leviticus 11:10) 
But anything that does not have fins and scales, among the creatures that move in the waters, and among those that live in rivers and ponds, will be ritually unclean for you.

(Leviticus 11:11) 
You must consider their flesh detestable, and you must avoid their dead bodies.

(Leviticus 11:12) 
All creatures in the waters that do not have fins and scales will be ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 11:13) 
These are the birds you are not permitted to eat, and they must be avoided by you: the eagle, the lammergeier (a type of vulture), and the sea eagle,

(Leviticus 11:14) 
the kite, and every kind of falcon or hawk,

(Leviticus 11:15) 
and every kind of raven.

(Leviticus 11:16) 
the ostrich, the little owl, the seagull, and every kind of hawk,

(Leviticus 11:17) 
the screech owl, the cormorant, and the ibis,

(Leviticus 11:18) 
the swan, the pelican, and the purple heron,

(Leviticus 11:19) 
the stork, and every kind of plover, also the hoopoe, and the bat.

(Leviticus 11:20) 
Every winged creature that walks on four legs is to be considered detestable by you.

(Leviticus 11:21) 
However, you are permitted to eat those among the winged creatures that walk on four legs, but which also have longer legs at the back, enabling them to leap upon the ground.

(Leviticus 11:22) 
You are permitted to eat these: every kind of locust, the bald locust, the cricket, and the grasshopper, each according to its own kind.

(Leviticus 11:23) 
But every winged creature that has only four legs (and no other means of propulsion) is to be considered detestable by you.

(Leviticus 11:24) 
Anyone who touches the dead bodies of these creatures will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 11:25) 
And anyone who carries away any part of their dead bodies must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 11:26) 
Every animal that has a hoof but neither divides it nor chews the cud will be ritually unclean. Anyone who touches such an animal will be ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 11:27) 
Among all the animals that walk on four legs, those that touch the ground with their paws as if they were hands are ritually unclean for you. Anyone who touches their dead bodies will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 11:28) 
And anyone who carries their dead bodies must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening. All these creatures are ritually unclean for you.

(Leviticus 11:29) 
These also are among the swarming creatures that move on the earth and are ritually unclean for you: the weasel, the mouse, and every kind of large lizard (like the monitor lizard),

(Leviticus 11:30) 
the shrew, the chameleon, the gecko, the wall lizard, and the mole.

(Leviticus 11:31) 
All these are ritually unclean. Anyone who touches their dead bodies will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 11:32) 
And if any dead body of these creatures falls upon an object, that object will become defiled. This applies to a wooden vessel, clothing, hides, or sacks. Any such object, if suitable for any use, must be immersed in water, and it will remain ritually unclean until evening. After that, it will be purified.

(Leviticus 11:33) 
But if any dead body of these creatures is found inside an earthenware vessel, that vessel must be broken, because it becomes so defiled that it cannot be cleansed.

(Leviticus 11:34) 
Any food that is touched by water from such a defiled vessel will become ritually unclean. And any liquid that is in such a vessel will also become defiled.

(Leviticus 11:35) 
And if any of these dead bodies falls on an oven or a stove, these items will become ritually unclean. They must be broken down and destroyed because they are defiled.

(Leviticus 11:36) 
However, springs, cisterns, and any collection of water will remain ritually clean. But anyone who touches the dead bodies of these creatures, even in such water, will become defiled.

(Leviticus 11:37) 
If any dead body falls on seeds that are meant for planting, the seeds will remain ritually clean.

(Leviticus 11:38) 
But if water has been poured over the seeds, and then a dead body falls into it, the seeds will become ritually unclean for you.

(Leviticus 11:39) 
If an animal that you are permitted to eat dies naturally, anyone who touches its dead body will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 11:40) 
And anyone who eats any part of its dead body, or carries it, must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 12:1) 
The Lord God spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:

(Leviticus 12:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When a woman becomes pregnant after receiving seed, and then gives birth to a male child, she will be ritually unclean for seven days. This time of uncleanness is exactly like the days of her monthly separation.”

(Leviticus 12:3) 
“On the eighth day, the boy child must be circumcised.”

(Leviticus 12:4) 
“She will then remain in a state of purification from her bleeding for thirty-three more days. During this period, she must not touch anything that is holy, nor may she enter the sanctuary of God, until the full days of her purification are complete.”

(Leviticus 12:5) 
“But if she gives birth to a female child, she will be ritually unclean for two weeks, following the same ritual for monthly separation. Then, she will remain in a state of purification from her bleeding for sixty-six more days.”

(Leviticus 12:6) 
“When the full time of her purification is complete, whether it was for a son or a daughter, she must bring a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, bringing them to the priest.”

(Leviticus 12:7) 
“The priest will then present these offerings before the Lord God and pray for her. In doing this, she will be declared ritually clean from the flow of her blood. This is the ritual law for a woman who gives birth, whether to a male or a female child.”

(Leviticus 12:8) 
“If her financial means are not sufficient, and she cannot afford to offer a lamb, then she may take two turtledoves or two young pigeons. One will be for a burnt offering, and the other will be for a sin offering. The priest will then pray for her, and she will be declared ritually clean.”

(Leviticus 13:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Leviticus 13:2) 
If a man develops a discolored eruption on the skin of his flesh—whether it's a scab, or a spot—and it looks like the plague of leprosy, which is a term for a severe, ritualistically 'unclean' skin condition, then he must be brought to Aaron the priest, or to any of his sons who are priests.

(Leviticus 13:3) 
And when the priest examines him, if the hairs in the affected area are white, and the area itself appears deeper than the rest of the skin, then it is indeed the uncleanness of leprosy, meaning it is a severe, ritually contaminating condition. The priest will then, by his judgment, declare him unclean and set him apart from the community.

(Leviticus 13:4) 
But if the spot is whitish, and it is not deeper than the rest of the skin, nor does it have white hairs, then by the priest's command, the man with the eruption must be confined for seven days.

(Leviticus 13:5) 
And if, on the seventh day when he is examined, his eruption has remained the same and has not spread on the skin, the priest must confine him again for another seven days.

(Leviticus 13:6) 
And if again, on the seventh day, the eruption appears faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest will declare him clean. The man must then wash his clothes, and he will be clean.

(Leviticus 13:7) 
But if after being declared clean and having shown himself to the priest, the leprosy has spread on the skin, he must return to the priest.

(Leviticus 13:8) 
And the priest, seeing that it has spread, will declare him unclean.

(Leviticus 13:9) 
If there is a plague of leprosy on a man, he must be brought to the priest.

(Leviticus 13:10) 
And when the priest has examined him, and sees white hairs on the skin, and living flesh that has grown in the affected area,

(Leviticus 13:11) 
it is a very old leprosy, and it has become chronic on the skin of his entire body. The priest will not declare him clean, because he is certainly unclean.

(Leviticus 13:12) 
But if the leprosy has broken out over the skin and covered all the flesh from head to foot, wherever the priest's eye can see,

(Leviticus 13:13) 
the priest will examine him and declare him completely clean. This is because it has entirely turned to a white color, and therefore he is clean.

(Leviticus 13:14) 
However, whenever living flesh appears in that area, he will be unclean:

(Leviticus 13:15) 
and then the priest, when he sees the living flesh, will judge him to be unclean.

(Leviticus 13:16) 
But if it turns back to whiteness again, and covers all the flesh,

(Leviticus 13:17) 
the priest will judge him to be clean.

(Leviticus 13:18) 
If on a person's flesh and skin, a boil has formed and healed,

(Leviticus 13:19) 
and after healing, a whitish or reddish scar appears, and the priest comes to examine this condition,

(Leviticus 13:20) 
and sees that it is deeper than the surrounding flesh and has white hairs, he will declare him unclean, for it is the plague of leprosy.

(Leviticus 13:21) 
But if the hair in the area is of its original color, and the skin is level and not deeper, he must confine the person for seven days.

(Leviticus 13:22) 
And if it spreads, you will judge him to be unclean with leprosy.

(Leviticus 13:23) 
But if it remains in its place, the priest will declare him clean.

(Leviticus 13:24) 
If human skin has been burned by fire, and in the wound itself, a reddish or whitish color appears,

(Leviticus 13:25) 
and when the priest examines it, he sees white hair in the affected area, and the area itself is deeper than the surrounding skin, he will judge him to be unclean, because the plague of leprosy has arisen in the burn.

(Leviticus 13:26) 
But if the hair is of its original color, and the skin is level and not deeper, he must confine the person for seven days.

(Leviticus 13:27) 
And on the seventh day, when he examines it, if it has spread, he will declare him unclean: for it is the plague of leprosy.

(Leviticus 13:28) 
But if the wound has remained in its place and is of its original color, and is not deeper than the surrounding flesh, the priest will declare him clean: because it is a burn wound, and it is healing.

(Leviticus 13:29) 
If a man or a woman has a plague-like affliction on the head or beard,

(Leviticus 13:30) 
and the priest sees that it is deeper than the surrounding flesh, and the hairs in it are yellowish and very fine, he will judge them to be unclean: because it is leprosy of the head and beard.

(Leviticus 13:31) 
But if the place of the affliction is level with the skin, and the hair is of its original color, he must confine the person for seven days.

(Leviticus 13:32) 
And on the seventh day, if the place of the affliction has not spread, and the hair is of its original color, and the skin is level,

(Leviticus 13:33) 
then with all the hair shaved off—he himself must shave it—and after washing his clothes, he will be clean.

(Leviticus 13:34) 
If after being declared clean, the affliction on the head or beard spreads again,

(Leviticus 13:35) 
and it is not deeper than the surrounding flesh, but the color of the affliction itself remains as it was before,

(Leviticus 13:36) 
the priest will be certain and will declare him unclean without any doubt: because the affliction has spread.

(Leviticus 13:37) 
But if it has remained in place, and the hair is of its original color, he will declare him clean, and he must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.

(Leviticus 13:38) 
If a man or a woman develops white spots on their skin,

(Leviticus 13:39) 
the priest will examine them: and if the color is somewhat dark, or not perfectly white, it is a mild skin condition called vitiligo, and the person is clean.

(Leviticus 13:40) 
A man whose hair has fallen out from his head is bald, and he is clean.

(Leviticus 14:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 14:2) 
“This is the law for one with leprosy: when he is declared clean, he shall be brought to the priest.

(Leviticus 14:3) 
The priest will go outside of the camp, and when he sees that the person is truly clean,

(Leviticus 14:4) 
he will order the one who is to be cleansed to bring two live, ritually clean sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet thread, and hyssop.

(Leviticus 14:5) 
Then, the priest will command that one of the sparrows be sacrificed in an earthenware vessel over living—that is, running—water.

(Leviticus 14:6) 
But the other live sparrow, along with the cedar wood, the scarlet thread, and the hyssop, he will dip into the blood of the sacrificed sparrow, and into the living water.

(Leviticus 14:7) 
And he will sprinkle it seven times upon the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy. After this ritual is completed, he will say: 'You are clean.'

(Leviticus 14:8) 
Then the cleansed person must wash his clothes, shave off all the hair from his head, eyebrows, and beard. He must remove all the hair from his body. He will then wash himself with water, and he will be clean.

(Leviticus 14:9) 
On the eighth day, he must take two male lambs without blemish, and one yearling ewe lamb without blemish. He also needs three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil by itself.

(Leviticus 14:10) 
The priest who performs the purification will bring the person and all these offerings before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

(Leviticus 14:11) 
The priest will stand and present him before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:12) 
He will take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil. He will present both of them—the lamb and the oil—as a wave offering before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:13) 
He will sacrifice the lamb in the holy place where the sin offering and burnt offering are usually sacrificed. For just as the sin offering and the burnt offering belong to the priest, so does the guilt offering; it is most holy.

(Leviticus 14:14) 
The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

(Leviticus 14:15) 
Then, from the log of oil, the priest will pour some into his own left palm.

(Leviticus 14:16) 
He will dip his right forefinger into the oil and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:17) 
The rest of the oil that remains in his hand he will pour on the head of the one being cleansed. In this way, the priest will make atonement for him before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:18) 
The priest will then offer the sin offering. And using its blood, as mentioned before, he will cleanse the one who has been purified.

(Leviticus 14:19) 
After that, he will sacrifice the burnt offering.

(Leviticus 14:20) 
He will place both the burnt offering and its grain offerings on the altar. In this way, the person will be clean.

(Leviticus 14:21) 
“Now, if the person is poor and cannot afford all these things, he must take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, making atonement for him. He also needs three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil.

(Leviticus 14:22) 
He must also bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one to be offered as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.

(Leviticus 14:23) 
On the eighth day of his purification, he will bring them to the priest, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:24) 
The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the log of oil, and wave them together as a wave offering before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:25) 
He will then sacrifice the lamb for the guilt offering. And he will put some of its blood on the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.

(Leviticus 14:26) 
The priest will also pour some of the oil into his left palm,

(Leviticus 14:27) 
and dipping his right forefinger into it, he will sprinkle some seven times before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:28) 
Then he will touch the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot—specifically, on the places where he had previously put the blood of the guilt offering.

(Leviticus 14:29) 
The rest of the oil that remains in the priest's hand he will pour on the head of the purified person, in order to make atonement for him before the Lord.

(Leviticus 14:30) 
He will also offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons—

(Leviticus 14:31) 
whichever he can afford to provide. One will be for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, according to their prescribed ritual.

(Leviticus 14:32) 
This is the sacrifice for the person with leprosy, who, because of his lack of resources, cannot afford to provide the full offering for his purification according to the Lord's law.”

(Leviticus 14:33) 
The Lord spoke again to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Leviticus 14:34) 
“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you as a possession, and if a disease of leprosy—that is, a severe mold or mildew—appears in a house or dwelling:

(Leviticus 14:35) 
the owner of that house must go and tell the priest, saying: 'It seems to me that something like leprosy has appeared in my house.'

(Leviticus 14:36) 
The priest will order that everything be taken out of the house before he enters to inspect whether it is truly the disease, so that everything inside the house will not become unclean. After this, he will finally go in to examine the house.

(Leviticus 14:37) 
When he inspects it, if there are spots on its walls that appear greenish or reddish, and they are sunken below the surrounding surface:

(Leviticus 14:38) 
he will go out the door of the house, and immediately close it up for seven days.

(Leviticus 14:39) 
He will return on the seventh day. If he finds that the affliction has spread,

(Leviticus 14:40) 
he will command that the stones in which the affliction is present be removed and thrown outside the city into an unclean place.

(Leviticus 15:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Leviticus 15:2) 
Any person, male or female, who suffers from an abnormal discharge of bodily fluid—such as an unusual flow of semen, or other bodily fluids—will be ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:3) 
This condition of ritual uncleanness will be established and declared as such when a discharge flows from his body, or even if the discharge is somehow stopped.

(Leviticus 15:4) 
Any bed on which such a person sleeps will become ritually unclean, and whatever they sit upon will also become ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:5) 
If anyone touches the bed of such a person, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:6) 
If anyone sits where the unclean person has sat, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:7) 
Whoever touches the flesh of the unclean person must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:8) 
If the unclean person spits upon someone who is ritually clean, that person must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:9) 
Every saddle or seat upon which the unclean person has ridden will become ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:10) 
And whoever touches any of these things will be ritually unclean until evening. If someone carries such a thing, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:11) 
Anyone whom the unclean person touches while sitting, if the unclean person has not first washed their hands, must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:12) 
Any clay vessel that the unclean person touches must be broken. But if it is a wooden vessel, it will be washed with water.

(Leviticus 15:13) 
Therefore, after the person with the discharge has been healed, they must count seven days for their purification. After washing their clothes and their entire body in living—that is, running—water, they will then be ritually clean.

(Leviticus 15:14) 
On the eighth day, such a person must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them before the Lord, at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, and give them to the priest.

(Leviticus 15:15) 
The priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. The priest will then pray for that person before the Lord, so that they may be cleansed from their discharge.

(Leviticus 15:16) 
When a man has a normal emission of semen, he must wash his entire body with water, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:17) 
Any garment or leather that he is wearing when this occurs will also become ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:18) 
If a man and woman have intercourse, both of them must wash themselves with water, and they will both be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:19) 
A woman who is menstruating will be set apart for seven days.

(Leviticus 15:20) 
Anyone who touches her during this time will be ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:21) 
Any bed on which she sleeps during her days of separation will become ritually unclean, and whatever she sits upon will also become ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:22) 
If anyone touches her bed, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:23) 
If anyone touches any vessel upon which she has sat, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:24) 
If a man sleeps with her during the time of her menstrual blood, he will become ritually unclean for seven days, and every bed on which he sleeps will become ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:25) 
A woman who suffers a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her normal menstruation, or one whose blood continues to flow immediately after her menstruation, will remain ritually unclean for as long as she suffers the discharge, just as she would during menstruation.

(Leviticus 15:26) 
Every bed on which she sleeps throughout the entire time of her discharge will be as ritually unclean as the bed of a menstruating woman, and whatever she sits upon will also be ritually unclean.

(Leviticus 15:27) 
Whoever touches any of these things will be ritually unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 15:28) 
If, however, the blood discharge ceases, she must count seven days for her purification.

(Leviticus 15:29) 
And on the eighth day, she will bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, for a sin offering and for a burnt offering.

(Leviticus 15:30) 
The priest, offering one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, will pray for her before the Lord concerning her discharge of uncleanness.

(Leviticus 15:31) 
In this way, you are to teach the children of Israel to be careful regarding ritual uncleanness, so that they do not die in their defilements when they would otherwise pollute My sanctuary, which is in their midst.

(Leviticus 15:32) 
This is the law for the man who has a discharge of semen, and for the man who becomes defiled through intercourse.

(Leviticus 15:33) 
It is also the law for a menstruating woman, and for a woman who suffers a discharge of blood, and for both a man and a woman who have intercourse with each other.

(Leviticus 16:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses after Aaron’s two sons had died, when they were killed for offering unauthorized fire, which was not according to God's command.

(Leviticus 16:2) 
And He said to him: "Speak to your brother Aaron and instruct him that he is not to enter the Most Holy Place, which is inside the veil and before the mercy seat that covers the Ark of the Covenant, whenever he wishes. If he does, he will die, because I will appear in a cloud over the mercy seat and execute judgment."

(Leviticus 16:3) 
Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place with these offerings: a young bull from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

(Leviticus 16:4) 
He is to put on a linen tunic, linen trousers for modesty, a linen sash, and a linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe his entire body before putting them on.

(Leviticus 16:5) 
From the entire assembly of the children of Israel, he is to take two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

(Leviticus 16:6) 
When Aaron offers the young bull as his own sin offering, he will make atonement for himself and for his household.

(Leviticus 16:7) 
He will then take the two male goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

(Leviticus 16:8) 
Aaron will cast lots for the two goats: one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for Azazel, the scapegoat.

(Leviticus 16:9) 
The goat on which the lot for the Lord falls, Aaron will offer as a sin offering.

(Leviticus 16:10) 
But the goat on which the lot for Azazel falls, he will present alive before the Lord. It will then be sent out into the wilderness to make atonement for the people by bearing their sins.

(Leviticus 16:11) 
After Aaron offers his young bull as a sin offering and his ram as a burnt offering, he will make atonement for himself and for his household.

(Leviticus 16:12) 
He will then take a censer full of burning coals from the altar, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the veil.

(Leviticus 16:13) 
So that when he puts the incense on the burning coals, the cloud of incense smoke will cover the mercy seat that is on the Ark of the Covenant, so he will not die.

(Leviticus 16:14) 
He will also take some of the blood from the young bull and sprinkle it with his finger seven times on the eastern side of the mercy seat.

(Leviticus 16:15) 
Then he will slaughter the goat for the people's sin offering and bring its blood inside the veil. He will do with its blood just as he did with the blood of the young bull, sprinkling it against the mercy seat.

(Leviticus 16:16) 
In this way, he will cleanse the Most Holy Place from the defilement of the children of Israel, from their transgressions, and from all their sins. He will do the same ritual for the tent of meeting, which is pitched among them in the midst of their impure dwelling.

(Leviticus 16:17) 
No one is to be in the tent of meeting when the high priest enters the Most Holy Place to make atonement for himself, for his household, and for the entire assembly of Israel, until he comes out.

(Leviticus 16:18) 
When he comes out to the altar that is before the Lord, he will make atonement for himself and for the people, and he will consecrate it.

(Leviticus 16:19) 
He will sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times with his finger, purifying and consecrating it from the defilement of the children of Israel.

(Leviticus 16:20) 
After he has finished cleansing the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he will bring forward the live goat.

(Leviticus 16:21) 
He will lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, all their transgressions, and all their sins. He will put these sins onto the head of the goat, and then send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for this task.

(Leviticus 16:22) 
As the goat carries all their iniquities into an uninhabited land and is released into the wilderness, it signifies the removal of their sins.

(Leviticus 16:23) 
Aaron will then go back into the tent of meeting, take off the linen garments he wore when he entered the Most Holy Place, and leave them there.

(Leviticus 16:24) 
He will bathe his entire body with water in a holy place, and then put on his regular priestly garments. After he comes out, he will offer his own burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.

(Leviticus 16:25) 
He will burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.

(Leviticus 16:26) 
The man who led the scapegoat away will wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and after that, he may return to the camp.

(Leviticus 16:27) 
The young bull and the goat that were offered for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, will be carried outside the camp. Their hides, flesh, and dung will be burned with fire.

(Leviticus 16:28) 
Anyone who burns them will wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and after that, he may return to the camp.

(Leviticus 16:29) 
This is to be a perpetual statute for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you are to afflict your souls—a solemn fast and time of repentance. You must not do any work, whether you are a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you.

(Leviticus 16:30) 
For on this Day of Atonement, you will be purified and cleansed from all your sins. Before the Lord, you will be made clean.

(Leviticus 16:31) 
This is a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you are to afflict your souls, as a perpetual ordinance.

(Leviticus 16:32) 
The atonement will be made by the priest who has been anointed and consecrated to serve as high priest in his father's place. He is to put on the sacred linen garments.

(Leviticus 16:33) 
He will make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting, and for the altar. He will also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.

(Leviticus 16:34) 
This is to be a perpetual statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel and for all their sins once a year. So Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Leviticus 17:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:

(Leviticus 17:2) 
“Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, saying: This is the command that the Lord has issued:

(Leviticus 17:3) 
Any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who slaughters an animal for sacrifice—whether an ox, a sheep, or a goat—inside the camp or outside the camp,

(Leviticus 17:4) 
and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness to offer it to the Lord, that man will be considered guilty of bloodshed, just as if he had shed human blood. Therefore, that person will be cut off from among his people.

(Leviticus 17:5) 
For this reason, the priests, the sons of Israel, must bring their offerings to the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness, and there they shall slaughter their peace offerings to the Lord.

(Leviticus 17:6) 
They shall pour the blood upon the Lord’s altar at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness, and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 17:7) 
They shall never again offer their sacrifices to pagan deities, with whom they have prostituted themselves through idolatry. This will be a perpetual statute for them and for their descendants.

(Leviticus 17:8) 
Also say to them: Any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who offers a burnt offering or any other sacrifice,

(Leviticus 17:9) 
and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness to offer it to the Lord, that person will be cut off from his people.

(Leviticus 17:10) 
Furthermore, any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among them, who eats blood—I will set My face against that person, and I will cut him off from among his people.

(Leviticus 17:11) 
This is because the very life-force of the flesh is in the blood. I have given this blood to you to pour on the altar, so that you may make atonement for your souls, because it is the blood that must make atonement for a soul.

(Leviticus 17:12) 
Therefore, I have said to the sons of Israel: No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any of the foreigners who reside among you eat blood.

(Leviticus 17:13) 
Also, any man from the sons of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who hunts and catches a wild animal or a bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.

(Leviticus 17:14) 
For the life-force of all flesh is in its blood. This is why I have said to the sons of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, because the life-force of the flesh is in its blood. And whoever eats it will be cut off.

(Leviticus 17:15) 
Any person who eats an animal that died naturally or was torn by a wild beast—whether an Israelite native or a foreigner—must wash his clothes and himself with water. He will be ritually unclean until evening; only then will he become clean through this ritual.

(Leviticus 17:16) 
But if he does not wash his clothes and his body, he will bear the consequence of his sin and uncleanliness.

(Leviticus 18:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:

(Leviticus 18:2) 
“Tell the children of Israel this: I am the Lord, your God.

(Leviticus 18:3) 
Do not imitate the customs of Egypt, where you once lived. And do not adopt the practices of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You must not follow their traditions and laws.

(Leviticus 18:4) 
Instead, you must obey my judgments. You must keep my commandments and live according to them. I am the Lord, your God.

(Leviticus 18:5) 
You must keep my statutes and my judgments. A person who obeys them will truly live and flourish because of them. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 18:6) 
No man shall approach any close relative to engage in sexual acts that expose her nakedness. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 18:7) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or your mother. She is your mother; you must not expose her nakedness.

(Leviticus 18:8) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife. This would be uncovering your father’s nakedness.

(Leviticus 18:9) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, whether she is your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, and whether she was born in your home or outside it. You must not do this.

(Leviticus 18:10) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter. These are your own nakedness, because they are your direct descendants.

(Leviticus 18:11) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter—she who was born to your father, who is therefore your sister. You must not do this.

(Leviticus 18:12) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister. She is your father’s flesh and blood.

(Leviticus 18:13) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother-in-law. She is your wife’s mother, who is like your own mother.

(Leviticus 18:14) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother. And you shall not approach his wife to have relations with her, for she is your close relative.

(Leviticus 18:15) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife, and for that reason, you must not uncover her nakedness.

(Leviticus 18:16) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife. This would be uncovering your brother’s nakedness.

(Leviticus 18:17) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her daughter, nor her granddaughter born from that daughter, to uncover their ignominy. They are too closely related to her, and such unions are forbidden.

(Leviticus 18:18) 
You shall not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife while your wife is still living, nor uncover her nakedness.

(Leviticus 18:19) 
You shall not approach a woman who is in her menstrual period, nor uncover her nakedness while she is in this state.

(Leviticus 18:20) 
You shall not lie with your neighbor’s wife, nor defile yourself with an emission of seed through such mixing.

(Leviticus 18:21) 
You shall not give any of your offspring to be consecrated to Moloch, nor shall you profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 18:22) 
You shall not lie with a male as you would with a woman. This is an abomination.

(Leviticus 18:23) 
You shall not lie with any beast to defile yourself. Nor shall a woman offer herself to a beast to lie with it. This is an abomination.

(Leviticus 18:24) 
Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices. For it is with all these defilements that the nations—whom I am driving out before you—have polluted themselves.

(Leviticus 18:25) 
The land itself became defiled. Therefore, I will punish its iniquity, and the land will literally vomit out its inhabitants.

(Leviticus 18:26) 
You, therefore, must keep my statutes and my judgments. For whoever commits any of these abominations will be cut off from among their people.

(Leviticus 18:27) 
For all these abominations were committed by the inhabitants of the land who were before you, and they thereby polluted the land.

(Leviticus 18:28) 
Beware, then, that the land does not also vomit you out, if you commit any such thing, just as it has vomited out the nation that was before you.

(Leviticus 18:29) 
Every person who commits any of these abominations will be cut off from among their people.

(Leviticus 18:30) 
Therefore, keep my commands. Do not follow the ordinances of those who were before you in these matters, and do not defile yourselves by them. I am the Lord, your God.

(Leviticus 19:1) 
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 19:2) 
“Speak to all the assembled people of Israel, and say to them: 'You shall be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy.'

(Leviticus 19:3) 
'Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father. You shall keep My Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:4) 
'Do not turn to idols, nor make for yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:5) 
'When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord, to be acceptable, you shall offer it willingly.

(Leviticus 19:6) 
'It shall be eaten on the same day that it is offered, and on the next day. Whatever remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.

(Leviticus 19:7) 
'If anyone eats anything from it on the third day, the sacrifice will be defiled, and it will not please the one who offered it:

(Leviticus 19:8) 
'The person who eats it will bear his guilt, because he has profaned what is holy to the Lord. That soul shall be cut off from his people.

(Leviticus 19:9) 
'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely clear the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.

(Leviticus 19:10) 
'Nor shall you gather the fallen grapes from your vineyard or the stray berries. You shall leave them to be gathered by the poor and the stranger. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:11) 
'You shall not steal. You shall not lie, nor shall any one of you deceive his neighbor.

(Leviticus 19:12) 
'You shall not swear falsely by My Name, nor shall you profane the Name of your God. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:13) 
'You shall not defraud your neighbor, nor oppress him by violence. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you until morning.

(Leviticus 19:14) 
'You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind. Instead, you shall fear the Lord your God, because I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:15) 
'You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor show deference to the powerful. You shall judge your neighbor justly.

(Leviticus 19:16) 
'You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people. You shall not stand by idly while your neighbor's life is at risk. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:17) 
'You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall openly rebuke your neighbor, so that you do not bear sin because of him.

(Leviticus 19:18) 
'You shall not seek revenge, nor harbor anger against your fellow citizens. You shall love your friend as yourself. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:19) 
'You shall keep My statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind of animal. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed. You shall not wear a garment woven from two different kinds of material.

(Leviticus 19:20) 
'If a man sleeps with a woman in an act of sexual intercourse, and she is a female slave betrothed to a husband, but has not yet been redeemed or given her freedom, they both shall be punished with scourging; they shall not be put to death, because she was not yet free.

(Leviticus 19:21) 
'But for his guilt, he shall bring a ram to the Lord at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony as an offering.

(Leviticus 19:22) 
'And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord for the sin he has committed, and the sin he committed shall be forgiven him.

(Leviticus 19:23) 
'When you enter the land and plant any fruit-bearing trees, you shall count their fruit as uncircumcised, meaning it is forbidden. For three years, it shall be considered unclean to you; it shall not be eaten.

(Leviticus 19:24) 
'In the fourth year, all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:25) 
'But in the fifth year you may eat of its fruit, gathering its produce. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:26) 
'You shall not eat anything with blood. You shall not practice divination or observe omens.

(Leviticus 19:27) 
'You shall not cut the hair on your head in a circular fashion, nor shall you shave off the edges of your beard.

(Leviticus 19:28) 
'You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead, nor put any tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:29) 
'Do not prostitute your daughter, lest the land become defiled and filled with wickedness.

(Leviticus 19:30) 
'You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:31) 
'Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:32) 
'You shall rise up before the gray head and honor the person of the elderly; and you shall fear the Lord your God. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 19:33) 
'If a stranger lives with you in your land, you shall not oppress him.

(Leviticus 19:34) 
'But the stranger who lives among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you too were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 19:35) 
'You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measures of length, in weight, or in liquid measure.

(Leviticus 19:36) 
'You shall have honest scales, honest weights, an honest dry measure (ephah), and an honest liquid measure (hin). I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

(Leviticus 19:37) 
'Therefore, you shall observe all My statutes and all My judgments, and you shall do them. I am the Lord.'

(Leviticus 20:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 20:2) 
Speak to the children of Israel: If anyone, whether an Israelite or a foreigner dwelling among you, gives their child to be sacrificed to the idol Moloch, that person must certainly be put to death. The people will stone them with stones.

(Leviticus 20:3) 
And I will set My face against that person, and I will cut them off from among their people. I will also cut off their children who were given to Moloch, because they have defiled My Sanctuary and profaned My holy name.

(Leviticus 20:4) 
If the people of the land neglect their duty and pretend not to see the one who gives their child to Moloch, and do not put that person to death,

(Leviticus 20:5) 
then I will set My face against that person and against their family. And I will cut them off, along with all those who consented to them in their idolatry and spiritual fornication with Moloch, from among their people.

(Leviticus 20:6) 
The soul who turns to mediums or diviners, and engages in spiritual fornication with them, I will set My face against that soul and cut them off from among their people.

(Leviticus 20:7) 
Sanctify yourselves and be holy, because I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 20:8) 
Keep My commandments and do them. I am the Lord who sanctifies you—the One who sets you apart for holiness.

(Leviticus 20:9) 
Anyone who curses their father or mother must certainly be put to death. Their blood will be upon them, because they cursed their father and mother.

(Leviticus 20:10) 
If a man commits adultery with the wife of another man, and he engages in illicit sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must certainly be put to death.

(Leviticus 20:11) 
If a man lies with his stepmother and reveals his father’s nakedness (meaning, dishonors his father), he must certainly be put to death. His blood will be upon him.

(Leviticus 20:12) 
If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them must certainly be put to death. They have committed a depraved act. Their blood will be upon them.

(Leviticus 20:13) 
If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. Both must certainly be put to death. Their blood will be upon them.

(Leviticus 20:14) 
If a man marries a woman and her mother, he has committed a depraved act. He shall be burned with fire along with them, and he will not remain among his people.

(Leviticus 20:15) 
If a man lies with an animal, he must certainly be put to death. And you must also kill the animal.

(Leviticus 20:16) 
If a woman approaches an animal to lie with it and mixes herself with it, both she and the animal must be put to death. Their blood will be upon them.

(Leviticus 20:17) 
If a man takes his sister, whether his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and sees her nakedness (meaning, has sexual relations with her), and she in turn sees his disgrace, it is a depraved act. They shall be put to death naked in the sight of their people, and they will bear the consequence of their iniquity.

(Leviticus 20:18) 
If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and uncovers her nakedness (meaning, has sexual relations with her) and exposes her menstrual flow, both of them shall perish from among their people.

(Leviticus 20:19) 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or your father’s sister (meaning, have sexual relations with your aunt), for whoever does this reveals the disgrace of his own flesh. They will bear the consequence of their iniquity.

(Leviticus 20:20) 
If a man lies with his uncle’s wife (meaning, his aunt by marriage) and reveals the disgrace of his relative, he has committed a depraved act. They will bear the consequence of their iniquity. They will die childless.

(Leviticus 20:21) 
If a man takes his brother’s wife, he has committed a disgraceful act. He has revealed his brother’s nakedness (meaning, dishonored his brother). He will die childless.

(Leviticus 20:22) 
Keep My statutes and My judgments, and do them, so that the land into which you are entering to dwell may not vomit you out.

(Leviticus 20:23) 
Do not walk in the customs of the nations whom I am driving out before you. For they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

(Leviticus 20:24) 
But I have said to you: Possess their land, and I will give it to you as an inheritance—a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from other peoples.

(Leviticus 20:25) 
Therefore, you must also separate the clean animal from the unclean, and the clean bird from the unclean. Do not defile yourselves with animals, or with birds, or with anything that creeps on the earth, which I have shown you to be unclean.

(Leviticus 20:26) 
Be holy to Me, for I am holy, the Lord your God. And I have separated you from the peoples, so that you may be Mine.

(Leviticus 20:27) 
A man or a woman who has a pythonic spirit (meaning, a spirit of divination or necromancy) or a spirit of sorcery must certainly be put to death. They will be stoned with stones. Their blood will be upon them.

(Leviticus 21:1) 
The Lord God also spoke to Moses, saying: 'Speak to Aaron's sons, who are the priests, and tell them this: They must not make themselves unclean because of a dead body among their own people.'

(Leviticus 21:2) 
They may, however, make themselves unclean for a close relative who is their flesh and blood: meaning their mother, father, son, daughter, or brother,

(Leviticus 21:3) 
or for their virgin sister who has not yet married.

(Leviticus 21:4) 
A priest must not defile himself on account of a chief man among his people, nor become ritually unclean on that account.

(Leviticus 21:5) 
They must not shave their heads bald, nor shave the edges of their beards in an unholy way, nor make any cuts on their bodies.

(Leviticus 21:6) 
They must be holy to the Lord their God, and they must not profane His holy name, because they offer the Lord's sacrifices by fire and the food of their God, and therefore they must be holy.

(Leviticus 21:7) 
They must not marry a prostitute, nor a woman who has been defiled by prostitution, nor a woman divorced from her husband: for they are consecrated to their God.

(Leviticus 21:8) 
You must treat him as holy, because he offers the food of your God, and he must be pure to you: for I am the Lord, who sanctifies you.

(Leviticus 21:9) 
If a priest's daughter is caught in prostitution, and thereby profanes the holiness of her father's name, she must be burned with fire.

(Leviticus 21:10) 
The high priest, who is the greatest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and whose hands have been consecrated for the priesthood, and who is clothed in holy garments, must not uncover his head, nor tear his garments in mourning.

(Leviticus 21:11) 
He must not go near any dead body at all: he must not make himself unclean, even for his own father or mother.

(Leviticus 21:12) 
He must not leave the holy place of the tabernacle so that he does not profane the Lord's sanctuary: for the oil of the holy anointing of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 21:13) 
He must marry a virgin.

(Leviticus 21:14) 
He must not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled by prostitution, or a prostitute: instead, he must marry a virgin from his own people.

(Leviticus 21:15) 
so that he does not defile his offspring among his people, because I am the Lord who has sanctified him.

(Leviticus 21:16) 
The Lord God also spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 21:17) 
Speak to Aaron: No man among your descendants, throughout their generations, who has a blemish or defect in his body, may offer the food of his God,

(Leviticus 21:18) 
nor may he approach to minister to Him.

(Leviticus 21:19) 
If there is any man who is blind, or lame, or who has a small, or a large, or a twisted nose,

(Leviticus 21:20) 
or who is a hunchback, or has an eye disease, or who has a white spot over the pupil of his eyes, or who has a chronic skin disease, or ringworm on his body, or a broken limb.

(Leviticus 21:21) 
Anyone among the descendants of Aaron who has such a blemish or defect, must not approach to minister to the Lord, nor to offer gifts to Him.

(Leviticus 21:22) 
However, he may eat from the showbread and from the other holy offerings.

(Leviticus 21:23) 
provided that he does not go inside the veil, nor approach the altar, because he has a blemish or defect, and he must not profane My sanctuary. I am the Lord who sanctifies them.

(Leviticus 21:24) 
So Moses spoke these words to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.

(Leviticus 22:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 22:2) 
Speak to Aaron and his sons, warning them to be careful with the holy offerings that the sons of Israel have consecrated. They must not defile My holy name, which I have sanctified for Myself, for I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 22:3) 
Say to them: Any man from your priestly lineage who approaches the holy offerings consecrated and presented to the Lord by the sons of Israel, while he is in a state of ritual uncleanness, will be cut off from My presence and face divine punishment. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 22:4) 
No man from the lineage of Aaron, if he has leprosy or a discharge, is to eat from the things that have been sanctified for Me, until he becomes ritually clean. Likewise, anyone who touches a person unclean due to a dead body or who has a seminal emission,

(Leviticus 22:5) 
or who touches any creeping thing by which he becomes defiled, or a man by whose touch he himself becomes unclean—that person will be unclean until evening.

(Leviticus 22:6) 
He must not eat from the holy offerings until he has purified himself. Instead, he must wash his body with water.

(Leviticus 22:7) 
When the sun has set, he will be clean. After that, he may eat from the holy offerings, because these are his priestly food.

(Leviticus 22:8) 
They—meaning the priests—must not eat any animal that has died a natural death or that has been torn by wild beasts, so that they do not become defiled by eating such things. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 22:9) 
They must keep My commands, so that they do not sin and die in the sanctuary, by defiling it. I am the Lord, who sanctifies them, setting them apart for My service.

(Leviticus 22:10) 
No unauthorized person, meaning anyone not from the priestly lineage, is to eat from the holy offerings. A guest living with the priest, or a hired servant, must not eat of them.

(Leviticus 22:11) 
However, if a priest purchases a servant as property, that servant is part of his household and may eat from the holy offerings. And those who are born into his household, his own domestic servants, may also eat of his priestly food.

(Leviticus 22:12) 
If a priest's daughter marries an unauthorized layman, she must not eat from the holy offerings or the firstfruits—these are reserved for the priestly family.

(Leviticus 22:13) 
But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, and has no children, and she returns to her father's household just as she was before her marriage, she may again eat of her father's priestly food. However, no unauthorized person is permitted to eat from these offerings.

(Leviticus 22:14) 
If someone, through inadvertent error, eats from the holy offerings, he must add a fifth of its value to what he ate and give it to the priest as restitution.

(Leviticus 22:15) 
And the sons of Israel must not defile the holy offerings consecrated and presented to the Lord,

(Leviticus 22:16) 
lest they bear the guilt of their sin when they eat those holy things while in a state of impurity. I am the Lord, who sanctifies them.

(Leviticus 22:17) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 22:18) 
Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, saying to them: If any man from the house of Israel, or from the resident foreigners among Israel, offers his gift—whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering—whatever it may be that is to be offered to the Lord as a burnt offering,

(Leviticus 22:19) 
for it to be accepted and pleasing to God, it must be an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats.

(Leviticus 22:20) 
You must not offer anything that has a blemish or defect, because such an offering will not be accepted as an atonement for you.

(Leviticus 22:21) 
If a man offers a peace offering to the Lord, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, from either cattle or sheep, he must offer it unblemished so that it may be acceptable to God. There must be no defect in it whatsoever.

(Leviticus 22:22) 
You must not offer to the Lord any animal that is blind, or has a broken limb, or a wound, or is afflicted with warts, or is scabby, or has mange. You must not present any of these with a fire offering upon the Lord's altar.

(Leviticus 22:23) 
You may offer a bull or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short as a freewill offering. However, it cannot be accepted to fulfill a vow, as it is not perfect.

(Leviticus 22:24) 
You must not offer to the Lord any animal whose testicles are crushed, bruised, torn, or cut off. You must not do any of these things within your land, meaning you should not mutilate animals in this way for offerings.

(Leviticus 22:25) 
You must not accept such offerings, meaning blemished animals, from the hand of a foreigner to present as food offerings to your God, or for any other purpose you intend to give to Him. This is because all such animals are corrupt and blemished, and therefore they will not be accepted by God.

(Leviticus 22:26) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 22:27) 
When a bull, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day onward, it may be offered to the Lord as an acceptable sacrifice.

(Leviticus 22:28) 
Whether it is a cow or a ewe, you must not slaughter it and its offspring on the same day.

(Leviticus 22:29) 
If you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord, so that you may be pleasing to Him, you must offer it voluntarily and sincerely.

(Leviticus 22:30) 
You must eat it on the same day it is offered. Nothing of it is to remain until the morning of the next day. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 22:31) 
Keep My commandments and perform them exactly as I have instructed. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 22:32) 
You must not profane My holy name, so that I may be sanctified and honored among the sons of Israel. I am the Lord, who sanctifies you and sets you apart.

(Leviticus 22:33) 
who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God and your protector. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 23:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: These are the Lord's solemn feasts, which you shall celebrate in their appointed times.

(Leviticus 23:3) 
Six days you shall do work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath, a holy rest; you shall do no work on it. It is the Lord's Sabbath throughout all your dwellings.

(Leviticus 23:4) 
These then are the Lord's most holy celebrations, which you shall observe in their seasons.

(Leviticus 23:5) 
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, is the Lord's Passover.

(Leviticus 23:6) 
And on the fifteenth day of this same month, is the Lord's solemn feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days, you shall eat unleavened bread.

(Leviticus 23:7) 
The first day shall be a most solemn assembly for you, and you shall do no servile work on it.

(Leviticus 23:8) 
But you shall offer burnt offerings by fire to the Lord for seven days. And the seventh day shall be held in veneration, and you shall do no servile work on it.”

(Leviticus 23:9) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 23:10) 
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: When you have entered the land which I will give you, and you have reaped its harvest, you shall bring sheaves of grain, the firstfruits of your harvest, to the priest.

(Leviticus 23:11) 
He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, that it may be accepted for you, on the day after the Sabbath, and he shall consecrate it.

(Leviticus 23:12) 
And on the day when the sheaf is waved, you shall offer a spotless year-old lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:13) 
And its accompanying sacrifices shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as a burnt offering by fire to the Lord, for a most sweet aroma. Its libations also shall be wine, a fourth part of a hin.

(Leviticus 23:14) 
You shall not eat bread, nor parched grain, nor any old produce from your harvest, until you have offered something of these to your God. This is an everlasting commandment throughout all your generations and in all your dwellings.”

(Leviticus 23:15) 
“Therefore, you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, on which you brought the sheaf of the firstfruits, seven full weeks.

(Leviticus 23:16) 
You shall count until the day after the completion of the seventh week—that is, fifty days. And then you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:17) 
From all your dwellings, you shall bring two loaves of bread as firstfruits to the Lord, two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with leaven, which you shall bake yourselves.

(Leviticus 23:18) 
And with the bread, you shall offer seven spotless year-old lambs, and one bull from the herd, and two rams. These shall be a burnt offering, with their accompanying sacrifices and libations, for a most sweet aroma to the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:19) 
You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two year-old lambs as sacrifices of peace offerings.

(Leviticus 23:20) 
When the priest has waved the bread with the lambs before the Lord, they shall be consecrated to the priest.

(Leviticus 23:21) 
And they shall belong to him. He shall also proclaim and announce on this very day a most solemn and holy convocation. You shall do no servile work on it. This shall be an everlasting statute throughout all your dwellings and in your generations.”

(Leviticus 23:22) 
“When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edge of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. Instead, you shall leave them for the poor and for the strangers. I am the Lord your God.”

(Leviticus 23:23) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 23:24) 
“Speak to the children of Israel: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a Sabbath—a solemn feast of remembrance, announced by the blowing of trumpets—and a holy convocation.

(Leviticus 23:25) 
You shall do no servile work on it, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord.”

(Leviticus 23:26) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 23:27) 
“On the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be the most solemn Day of Atonement, and it shall be called holy. You shall afflict your souls on it, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:28) 
You shall do no work on this day, for it is the Day of Propitiation, so that the Lord your God may make propitiation for you.

(Leviticus 23:29) 
Every soul who has not afflicted himself on this day shall perish from among his people.

(Leviticus 23:30) 
And whoever does any work, I will destroy that soul from among his people.

(Leviticus 23:31) 
You shall do no work. This shall be an everlasting statute for you throughout all your generations and dwellings.

(Leviticus 23:32) 
It is a Sabbath of rest from evening until evening. You shall celebrate your Sabbaths.”

(Leviticus 23:33) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 23:34) 
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: From the fifteenth day of this seventh month, for seven days, there shall be the solemn Feast of Tabernacles to the Lord.

(Leviticus 23:35) 
The first day shall be a most solemn and holy assembly. You shall do no servile work on it.

(Leviticus 23:36) 
For seven days you shall offer burnt offerings to the Lord. And on the eighth day, there shall be a most solemn and holy convocation, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord. For it is a day of conclusion and assembly, and you shall do no servile work on it.

(Leviticus 23:37) 
These are the Lord's festivals, which you shall celebrate with most holy convocations, and in them you shall offer oblations to the Lord: burnt offerings and sacrifices, libations and victims, each on its proper day.

(Leviticus 23:38) 
These are in addition to the Lord's Sabbaths, and your gifts, and all that you offer to the Lord by vow or by freewill.

(Leviticus 23:39) 
Therefore, from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered all the produce of your land, you shall celebrate the Lord's solemn feast for seven days. On the first day and on the eighth day, there shall be a Sabbath—that is, a day of rest.

(Leviticus 23:40) 
And on the first day, you shall take for yourselves the fruit of a beautiful tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick-leaved trees, and willows from the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.”

(Leviticus 24:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 24:2) 
"Command the children of Israel to bring you the purest and clearest olive oil, so that the lamps can be kept lit continually.

(Leviticus 24:3) 
This is to be done outside the veil of testimony, within the tabernacle of the covenant. The lamps must burn from evening until morning before the Lord without fail, an everlasting law for all your descendants.

(Leviticus 24:4) 
The lamps upon the lampstand, which is made of pure gold, must always be kept trimmed and burning before the Lord's presence.

(Leviticus 24:5) 
You shall also take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it, each loaf made with two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour.

(Leviticus 24:6) 
You shall place them, in two stacks of six loaves each, upon the table of pure gold before the Lord.

(Leviticus 24:7) 
You shall place pure frankincense upon each stack, so that the bread may serve as a memorial portion, an offering to the Lord.

(Leviticus 24:8) 
These loaves shall be changed out every Sabbath before the Lord, received from the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant.

(Leviticus 24:9) 
And these loaves shall be for Aaron and his sons to eat in a most holy place, because they are a most holy portion from the Lord's offerings, belonging to them by an everlasting right.

(Leviticus 24:10) 
Now, the son of an Israelite woman—who had an Egyptian father—came out among the children of Israel. This man got into a quarrel in the camp with another Israelite.

(Leviticus 24:11) 
And this man blasphemed the Lord's Name and cursed Him. Because of this, he was brought to Moses.

(Leviticus 24:12) 
His mother's name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, from the tribe of Dan.

(Leviticus 24:13) 
They put him in custody until they could learn what the Lord's command would be concerning him.

(Leviticus 24:14) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Leviticus 24:15) 
"Take the one who blasphemed outside the camp. Let all who heard his blasphemy lay their hands upon his head as witnesses. Then, let the entire congregation of the children of Israel stone him to death."

(Leviticus 24:16) 
And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: 'Whoever curses his God shall bear the full consequence for his sin.'

(Leviticus 24:17) 
And whoever strikes and kills any person must be put to death.

(Leviticus 24:18) 
Whoever strikes and kills an animal must make restitution, paying back life for life.

(Leviticus 24:19) 
If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:

(Leviticus 24:20) 
fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Whatever injury or blemish he inflicted, such shall he be compelled to suffer.

(Leviticus 24:21) 
Whoever strikes and kills a human being shall be put to death. But whoever wounds or kills an animal shall make restitution for it.

(Leviticus 24:22) 
You shall have the same law for both the foreigner and the native-born person who has sinned, because I am the Lord your God.

(Leviticus 24:23) 
So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. They led the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death. The children of Israel did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Leviticus 25:1) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Moses while he was on Mount Sinai, saying:

(Leviticus 25:2) 
Say this to the people of Israel:
“When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land itself must also keep a Sabbath rest for the Lord.

(Leviticus 25:3) 
For six years, you may sow your fields and prune your vineyards, and gather their produce.

(Leviticus 25:4) 
But during the seventh year, the land itself must have a full rest, a Sabbath for the Lord.
You must not sow your field or prune your vineyard during that year.

(Leviticus 25:5) 
Do not harvest whatever grows naturally from your previous crop, and do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines, even those that bear fruit on their own.
It is a year of holy rest for the land.

(Leviticus 25:6) 
But whatever the land yields during its Sabbath rest will be food for you—for yourself and your servants, your male and female slaves, your hired workers, and any foreign residents who live with you.

(Leviticus 25:7) 
All the produce of the land during that year will also be food for your livestock and for all the wild animals that are in your land.”

(Leviticus 25:8) 
Then you must count seven Sabbath years—seven times seven years.
This totals forty-nine years.

(Leviticus 25:9) 
On the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, you must sound the ram’s horn loudly throughout all your land.
This will mark the fiftieth year as a holy year for you.
You must proclaim liberation throughout the land for all its inhabitants.
This year will be the Jubilee for you.

(Leviticus 25:10) 
The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you.
You must not sow, nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather grapes from the unpruned vines.

(Leviticus 25:11) 
Because it is the Jubilee, it will be holy to you; you will eat what the fields produce naturally.

(Leviticus 25:12) 
In this year of Jubilee, every person must return to their family property and to their ancestral clan.

(Leviticus 25:13) 
When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy anything from him, you must not cheat one another.
The price of the land will depend on the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee.

(Leviticus 25:14) 
You will buy from your neighbor according to the number of harvests remaining before the Jubilee.

(Leviticus 25:15) 
If there are many years left until the Jubilee, you will increase the price; if there are only a few years left, you will reduce the price.
It is the number of harvests, not the land itself, that he is selling to you.

(Leviticus 25:16) 
You must not oppress one another.
Instead, you must fear your God, because I am the Lord God, your God.

(Leviticus 25:17) 
You must follow My statutes and keep My ordinances and obey them.
Then you will live securely in the land, without any fear.

(Leviticus 25:18) 
The land will yield its produce, and you will eat your fill, and you will dwell in it without dread.

(Leviticus 25:19) 
If you ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?”

(Leviticus 25:20) 
I will send My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it will produce enough grain for three years.

(Leviticus 25:21) 
So you will sow in the eighth year, but you will still be eating from the old produce until the ninth year, until the new harvest comes in.

(Leviticus 25:22) 
The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine, and you are merely My temporary residents and tenants.

(Leviticus 25:23) 
Therefore, for all the land of your possession, you must provide for the right of redemption when it is sold.

(Leviticus 25:24) 
If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and sells some of his family property, then his nearest relative who can redeem it must come and buy back what his kinsman sold.

(Leviticus 25:25) 
If a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he himself later acquires sufficient means to redeem it,

(Leviticus 25:26) 
then he must calculate the years since the sale, deduct the value of the produce taken by the buyer, and repay the remainder to the man who bought it.
Then the property will return to him.

(Leviticus 25:27) 
But if he cannot afford to buy it back, then what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee.
In the Jubilee, it will be released, and the property will revert to the original owner.

(Leviticus 25:28) 
If someone sells a dwelling house inside a walled city, he retains the right to redeem it for a full year after the sale.

(Leviticus 25:29) 
If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house within the walled city will belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants.
It will not revert to the original owner in the Jubilee.

(Leviticus 25:30) 
But houses in unwalled villages must be treated as open country.
They may be redeemed at any time, and they will revert to the original owner in the Jubilee.

(Leviticus 25:31) 
However, the houses in the Levitical cities, which are designated cities for the Levites, may always be redeemed by the Levites.

(Leviticus 25:32) 
If a Levite sells a house in a Levitical city, it will revert to him in the Jubilee, because the houses in the Levitical cities are their perpetual possession among the people of Israel.

(Leviticus 25:33) 
The pasturelands around their cities, however, cannot be sold, because they are their permanent possession for all time.

(Leviticus 25:34) 
If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and unable to support himself, you must help him, just as you would help a foreign resident or a temporary settler, so that he can live among you.

(Leviticus 25:35) 
Do not charge him interest on the money you lend him, or take any profit from him.
Instead, you must fear your God, so that your kinsman can continue to live alongside you.

(Leviticus 25:36) 
You must not lend him money at interest, nor sell him food for profit.

(Leviticus 25:37) 
I am the Lord God, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

(Leviticus 25:38) 
If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and sells himself to you, you must not make him serve as a common slave.

(Leviticus 25:39) 
He must be treated like a hired worker or a temporary resident among you; he will serve you only until the Year of Jubilee.

(Leviticus 25:40) 
Then he and his children with him will be released from you, and he will return to his family and to the family property of his ancestors.

(Leviticus 26:1) 
You shall not make idols for yourselves, nor set up any carved images or sacred pillars, nor place any notable stone in your land for the purpose of worshiping it. For I am the Lord, your God.

(Leviticus 26:2) 
Keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am the Lord.

(Leviticus 26:3) 
If you live according to my commands, and carefully obey my commandments, putting them into practice,

(Leviticus 26:4) 
then I will give you rain at the proper times, and the land will produce its crops, and the trees will be filled with fruit.

(Leviticus 26:5) 
Your threshing season will last until the harvest time, and your grape harvest will extend until planting time. You will eat your fill of bread, and you will live securely in your land, without fear.

(Leviticus 26:6) 
I will bring peace to your land; you will sleep soundly, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove dangerous animals, and no army will invade your land.

(Leviticus 26:7) 
You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you.

(Leviticus 26:8) 
Five of you will put one hundred of your enemies to flight, and one hundred of you will put ten thousand to flight. And your enemies will fall before you by the sword.

(Leviticus 26:9) 
I will look favorably upon you and I will make you fruitful; you will multiply greatly, and I will confirm my covenant with you.

(Leviticus 26:10) 
You will still be eating from last year's plentiful harvest when you must clear space for the new harvest.

(Leviticus 26:11) 
I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul will not reject you.

(Leviticus 26:12) 
I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and you will be my people.

(Leviticus 26:13) 
I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be slaves to them. I who broke the yoke of your slavery from your necks and made you walk with your heads held high.

(Leviticus 26:14) 
But if you will not listen to me, nor do all my commandments,

(Leviticus 26:15) 
if you despise my laws and scorn my judgments by refusing to do what I have commanded, and thereby break my covenant:

(Leviticus 26:16) 
I, in turn, will do this to you: I will swiftly punish you with misery and with a burning fever that will dim your eyes and waste away your lives. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will devour it.

(Leviticus 26:17) 
I will turn my face against you, and you will fall before your enemies. You will be ruled by those who hate you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.

(Leviticus 26:18) 
If even after these things you will not listen to me, I will add seven times more plagues upon you for your sins.

(Leviticus 26:19) 
I will break your pride, and I will make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze, yielding nothing.

(Leviticus 26:20) 
Your labor will be futile from now on, for the land will not yield its crops, nor will the trees produce their fruit.

(Leviticus 26:21) 
If you continue to walk in hostility toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will increase your plagues sevenfold according to your sins.

(Leviticus 26:22) 
I will send wild animals among you, which will devour your children and your livestock and reduce your numbers until your land is desolate, and your roads become deserted.

(Leviticus 26:23) 
If even after this you are unwilling to be corrected, but continue to walk in hostility toward me:

(Leviticus 26:24) 
then I will also walk in hostility toward you, and I will strike you seven times more for your sins.

(Leviticus 26:25) 
I will bring an avenging sword upon you to punish you for breaking my covenant. And when you gather yourselves in your cities for protection, I will send pestilence among you, and you will be delivered to your enemies.

(Leviticus 26:26) 
When I break your supply of bread, so that ten men will bake their bread in one oven and will ration it out by weight, you will eat, but you will not be satisfied.

(Leviticus 26:27) 
But if, even after all this, you still will not listen to me, but continue to resist me:

(Leviticus 26:28) 
then I, in turn, will oppose you in wrath, and I will strike you seven times more for your sins.

(Leviticus 26:29) 
so that you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.

(Leviticus 26:30) 
I will destroy your high places and break your idol images. I will cast your corpses upon the corpses of your idols, and my soul will detest you.

(Leviticus 26:31) 
I will reduce your cities to ruins and your sanctuaries will be laid waste, and I will no longer accept the sweet aroma of your sacrifices.

(Leviticus 26:32) 
I will lay waste your land, and your enemies who settle there will be astonished at its desolation.

(Leviticus 26:33) 
And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will pursue you with a drawn sword. Your land will be desolate, and your cities ruined.

(Leviticus 26:34) 
Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths throughout all the days of your desolation, when you are in an enemy land. It will rest and make up for all the Sabbaths you failed to give it.

(Leviticus 26:35) 
because it did not rest on your Sabbaths when you dwelt in it.

(Leviticus 26:36) 
As for those of you who survive, I will put a dread into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a rustling leaf will chase them. They will flee as though from a sword, and they will fall even when no one is pursuing them.

(Leviticus 26:37) 
And they will stumble over one another, as if fleeing from battle, even when no one is pursuing them. You will not be able to stand against your enemies.

(Leviticus 26:38) 
You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.

(Leviticus 26:39) 
And those of you who are left will waste away because of their sins in the lands of their enemies; they will pine away both for their own sins and for the sins of their fathers.

(Leviticus 26:40) 
This will continue until they confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their ancestors, by which they transgressed against me and continued in hostility toward me.

(Leviticus 27:1) 
And the Lord God spoke to Moses, saying to him:

(Leviticus 27:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them this: If a person makes a vow, dedicating their own life to the Lord God, they must live according to the assigned value of their vow.

(Leviticus 27:3) 
If the person is a male, from twenty years old up to sixty years old, his assigned value will be fifty shekels of silver, weighed by the standard of the sanctuary.

(Leviticus 27:4) 
If the person is a female, her assigned value will be thirty shekels.

(Leviticus 27:5) 
If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, a male’s assigned value will be twenty shekels, and a female’s assigned value will be ten shekels.

(Leviticus 27:6) 
If the person is from one month old up to five years old, for a male, five shekels of silver will be his assigned value; for a female, three shekels will be her assigned value.

(Leviticus 27:7) 
If the person is sixty years old or older, a male’s assigned value will be fifteen shekels, and a female’s assigned value will be ten shekels.

(Leviticus 27:8) 
But if the person is poor and cannot afford the assigned value, he must stand before the priest. The priest will then assess how much the person can afford to pay, and that is what he will give.

(Leviticus 27:9) 
If the vow concerns an animal that can be offered to the Lord God, whatever animal of that kind enters the sanctuary will be consecrated.

(Leviticus 27:10) 
The consecrated animal cannot be exchanged or altered, neither a good one for a bad one, nor a bad one for a good one. If anyone tries to exchange an animal, both the exchanged animal and the original animal will become consecrated.

(Leviticus 27:11) 
If the vow concerns an unclean animal, one that cannot be offered to the Lord God, it must be presented before the priest.

(Leviticus 27:12) 
The priest will judge whether the animal is good or bad and will set its value. Whatever value the priest sets, that will be its final price.

(Leviticus 27:13) 
But if the person who made the vow wishes to buy back the animal, they must add one-fifth to its assigned value.

(Leviticus 27:14) 
If a person makes a vow concerning their house, consecrating it to the Lord God, the priest will inspect it to determine if it is good or bad. Its value will stand according to the price the priest sets.

(Leviticus 27:15) 
But if the person who made the vow wishes to buy back their house, they must add one-fifth of the estimated money, and then they will possess it again.

(Leviticus 27:16) 
If a person makes a vow concerning their inherited field and consecrates it to the Lord God, its value will be assessed according to the amount of seed required to plant it. A field requiring thirty measures of barley will be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

(Leviticus 27:17) 
If the person dedicates the field immediately after the Year of Jubilee, it will stand at its full assessed value.

(Leviticus 27:18) 
But if the field is dedicated a few years after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the money according to the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee, and the full price will be reduced by that amount.

(Leviticus 27:19) 
If the person who made the vow wishes to buy back their field, they must add one-fifth of the estimated money, and then they will possess it.

(Leviticus 27:20) 
But if the person does not wish to buy it back and instead sells the field to someone else, it can no longer be redeemed by the original owner.

(Leviticus 27:21) 
For when the field is set free in the Jubilee year, without any redemption, it will belong to the priests, as consecrated property belonging to the Lord God.

(Leviticus 27:22) 
If a person consecrates to the Lord God a field that they have bought, which is not part of their ancestral inheritance,

(Leviticus 27:23) 
the priest will calculate the value of its price according to the number of years remaining until the Jubilee. The person making the vow must then immediately give the Lord God the value of the offering.

(Leviticus 27:24) 
In the Jubilee year, however, the field will return to its former owner, who had sold it and owned it as part of his inheritance.

(Leviticus 27:25) 
All valuations must be weighed by the standard of the sanctuary shekel. One shekel has twenty gerahs—which is the weight of the obol.

(Leviticus 27:26) 
Also, no one can consecrate the firstborn animals, for they already belong to the Lord God. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, they are already the Lord God’s.

(Leviticus 27:27) 
But if the firstborn animal is unclean, it must be bought back according to its assigned value, and one-fifth of the price will be added. If it is not bought back, it will be sold to another person according to its assigned value.

(Leviticus 27:28) 
Anything that a person dedicates to the Lord God as a thing irrevocably devoted—whether it is a person, an animal, or a field that is their inherited property—it cannot be sold or bought back. Whatever is once irrevocably devoted will be most holy to the Lord God.

(Leviticus 27:29) 
Every human soul and person who is irrevocably devoted will not be bought back, but must be put to death.

(Leviticus 27:30) 
All tithes of the land, whether from the produce of the soil or from the fruit of the trees, belong to the Lord God and are consecrated to Him.

(Leviticus 27:31) 
If anyone wishes to buy back any part of their tithes, they must add one-fifth to its assigned value.

(Leviticus 27:32) 
Regarding all tithes of cattle, sheep, and goats, whatever passes under the shepherd’s staff as the tenth animal will be consecrated to the Lord God.

(Leviticus 27:33) 
The tenth animal will not be examined to see if it is good or bad, nor can it be exchanged for another. If anyone exchanges it, both the exchanged animal and the original animal will become consecrated, and neither will return to the original owner.”

(Leviticus 27:34) 
These are the commandments that the Lord God gave to Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
