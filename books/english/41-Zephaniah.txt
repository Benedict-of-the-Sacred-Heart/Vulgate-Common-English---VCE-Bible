(Zephaniah 1:1) 
The Word of the Lord, which was delivered to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah:

(Zephaniah 1:2) 
The Lord says, “I will completely sweep away the land.”

(Zephaniah 1:3) 
“I will take away men and the animals; I will take away the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea. And the wicked will collapse along with their sins. I will destroy all mankind from the face of the land,” says the Lord.

(Zephaniah 1:4) 
“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all those who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy from this place the remnants of Baal, and the names of the false priests, along with the true priests.

(Zephaniah 1:5) 
“Also, I will destroy those who worship the armies of the sky on the rooftops, and who worship, and swear by the Lord, and swear by Milcom.

(Zephaniah 1:6) 
“I will also destroy those who have turned away from the Lord, those who have not sought after the Lord, nor inquired after Him.”

(Zephaniah 1:7) 
Be silent before the face of the Lord God, because the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared his sacrifice, he has sanctified those whom he has called.

(Zephaniah 1:8) 
“And on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, I will visit the princes and the sons of the king, and all those who are clothed in foreign garments.

(Zephaniah 1:9) 
“On that day I will visit everyone who leaps over the threshold, who fills the house with violence and deceit.

(Zephaniah 1:10) 
“On that day,” says the Lord, “there will be a cry of wailing from the Fish Gate, and a lamentation from the second quarter, and a great destruction from the hills.

(Zephaniah 1:11) 
Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar, because all the people of Canaan have become silent; all those who were merchants have been destroyed.

(Zephaniah 1:12) 
“At that time I will thoroughly search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will visit the men of renown who say in their hearts, ‘The Lord does not act for good, nor does he act for evil.’

(Zephaniah 1:13) 
“And their wealth will be for plunder, and their houses for desolation; they will build houses, but not inhabit them, and they will plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.”

(Zephaniah 1:14) 
The great day of the Lord is near; it is near, and hastens quickly; the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter; there the strong man will cry out.

(Zephaniah 1:15) 
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

(Zephaniah 1:16) 
a day of the trumpet and the battle cry against the fortified cities and against the high corners.

(Zephaniah 1:17) 
“I will bring distress upon men, and they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the Lord; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their bodies like dung.

(Zephaniah 1:18) 
“Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land will be consumed in the fire of his jealousy, for he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the land.”

(Zephaniah 2:1) 
Gather yourselves together, you nations that don't care about God,

(Zephaniah 2:2) 
Before the time to act comes like the wind blows the dust away, before the anger of the Lord's fury comes on you, before the Lord's day of wrath descends on you.

(Zephaniah 2:3) 
Seek the Lord, all you humble ones of the earth, you who work to do His will. Seek righteousness, seek meekness, so that perhaps you may be protected on the day of the Lord's fury.

(Zephaniah 2:4) 
For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ascalon will become a wasteland. They will cast out the people of Ashdod at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.

(Zephaniah 2:5) 
Woe to you who live on the coast, you nation of the lost! The Lord's word is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. I will destroy you so that no one will live there.

(Zephaniah 2:6) 
The coast will become pastures and folds for flocks, for those who rest in the middle of their herds.

(Zephaniah 2:7) 
And those who remain of the house of Judah will be saved, and they will graze in the houses of Ascalon, when they sit at evening.

(Zephaniah 2:8) 
I have heard the taunts of Moab and the insults of the children of Ammon, who have reproached My people and have magnified themselves against their borders.

(Zephaniah 2:9) 
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah: a possession of thorns, and salt pits, and a desolation forever: the remnants of My people will plunder them, and the remnants of My nation will possess them.

(Zephaniah 2:10) 
This will happen to them for their pride, because they have reproached and have magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts.

(Zephaniah 2:11) 
The Lord will be terrible against them: He will destroy all the gods of the earth; and all the islands of the nations, each in its own place, will worship Him.

(Zephaniah 2:12) 
You Ethiopians, you also will be slain by My sword.

(Zephaniah 2:13) 
And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the desert.

(Zephaniah 2:14) 
Herds will lie down in its midst, all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the hedgehog will lodge in its thresholds; the owl will hoot in the windows; the raven will be in the roof beams; for their strength has been crushed.

(Zephaniah 2:15) 
This is the joyful city that dwelt securely, that said in her heart: 'I am, and there is no more.' How has she become a desolation, a den for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss and shake their hand.

(Zephaniah 3:1) 
What misery awaits the rebellious, polluted, oppressing city!

(Zephaniah 3:2) 
It has not obeyed God. It has rejected all guidance. It did not trust in the Lord. It would not approach its God.

(Zephaniah 3:3) 
Its leaders are roaring lions in the city. Its judges are wolves at dusk, devouring until dawn.

(Zephaniah 3:4) 
Its prophets are brash and untrustworthy men. Its priests defile holy things, and they disrespect the law.

(Zephaniah 3:5) 
The Lord, who is just, is within it. He will do no injustice. Every morning, He brings His judgment to light, and it never fails.

(Zephaniah 3:6) 
He has destroyed nations. Their towers are desolate. He has made their roads deserted so no one can pass. Their cities are desolate, without inhabitants.

(Zephaniah 3:7) 
I said: Surely you will fear Me and accept guidance. You will not be destroyed before My eyes, nor lose all of My decrees. But instead, rising up every morning, they corrupt all their thoughts.

(Zephaniah 3:8) 
Therefore, be patient and wait for Me, says the Lord, until the day I arise to judge. Because My judgment will come upon the nations so I can gather kings and gather kingdoms, pouring out upon them all My indignation, all the heat of My anger. For in the fire of My zeal, all the earth will be consumed.

(Zephaniah 3:9) 
Then I will give to the peoples a pure tongue so that all will call on the name of the Lord, and they will serve Him with one accord.

(Zephaniah 3:10) 
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My supplicants, the remnant of My scattered, will bring offerings to Me.

(Zephaniah 3:11) 
In that day, you will not be ashamed because of all your deeds, by which you have transgressed against Me. Then I will remove from your midst those who boast of their pride. You will never again be exalted on My holy mountain.

(Zephaniah 3:12) 
I will leave within you a poor and humble people, and they will trust in the name of the Lord.

(Zephaniah 3:13) 
The remnant of Israel will do no wrong, nor will they speak lies, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth. For they will feed and rest, and no one will frighten them.

(Zephaniah 3:14) 
Sing, daughter of Zion; shout with joy, Israel; rejoice and exult, daughter of Jerusalem, with all your heart.

(Zephaniah 3:15) 
The Lord has removed your judgment; He has turned away your enemies. The Lord, the King of Israel, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil.

(Zephaniah 3:16) 
In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, Zion; let not your hands be slack.”

(Zephaniah 3:17) 
The Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior, He will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will be silent in His love for you; He will rejoice over you with singing.

(Zephaniah 3:18) 
I will gather those who mourn for the feasts, who are of you, and I will take away your disgrace.

(Zephaniah 3:19) 
Behold, I will deal with all those who afflict you at that time; and I will save the lame and gather the outcast; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the earth.

(Zephaniah 3:20) 
At that time, I will bring you in, and at the time I gather you together; for I will give you renown and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the Lord.
