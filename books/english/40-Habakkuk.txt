(Habakkuk 1:1) 
This is the burden of prophecy that Habakkuk saw.

(Habakkuk 1:2) 
How much longer, Lord, will I cry out to you, and will you not hear? How much longer will I complain of violence to you, and will you not save?

(Habakkuk 1:3) 
Why do you show me wickedness and toil, that I may see injustice and the destruction of those who do wrong to me? Because of this, judgment will come, and strife will come upon all.

(Habakkuk 1:4) 
Because of this, the law is weakened, and the judgment never succeeds: because the wicked are stronger than the righteous. Therefore, perverse judgment comes forth.

(Habakkuk 1:5) 
Look among the nations and see, and be astonished, and be astounded: because you will do a work in your days that you will not believe when it is told.

(Habakkuk 1:6) 
Because behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation that marches across the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that are not their own.

(Habakkuk 1:7) 
They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and their power will come forth from themselves.

(Habakkuk 1:8) 
Their horses are swifter than leopards, and they are more fierce than wolves at evening; their horsemen are proud.

(Habakkuk 1:9) 
They will all come to plunder; their faces will be as a burning wind, and they will gather captives like sand.

(Habakkuk 1:10) 
They themselves will mock kings, and they will scoff at princes; they will laugh at every fortress and they will build a ramp to capture it.

(Habakkuk 1:11) 
Then his spirit will change, and he will pass through; and he will consider this power to be his own wickedness.

(Habakkuk 1:12) 
Are you not from the beginning, Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Lord, you have appointed him for judgment, and you have set him as a rebuke.

(Habakkuk 1:13) 
You whose eyes are pure and cannot look upon evil, who cannot look upon wickedness, why do you look on those who act unjustly, and are silent when the wicked devour one more just than themselves?

(Habakkuk 1:14) 
You make humans like the fish of the sea, and like the creeping things that have no ruler.

(Habakkuk 1:15) 
He takes them all up with a hook and drags them into his net and gathers them into his dragnet; over this, he rejoices and exults.

(Habakkuk 1:16) 
For this reason, he will sacrifice to his net, and he will offer sacrifices to his dragnet: because for this reason, his portion is fattened, and his food is rich.

(Habakkuk 1:17) 
Therefore, will he empty his sword, and will he not have mercy on the nations?

(Habakkuk 2:1) 
I will stand guard over my watch. I will go on. I will stand on my watchtower to see what He might say to me in response to my prayers.

(Habakkuk 2:2) 
The Lord will answer me. He will say, “Write down the vision. Make it clear on tablets, so that everyone who reads it can run with it.”

(Habakkuk 2:3) 
For the vision is not of immediate fulfillment. It looks ahead to the end, and it will not lie. If it seems to tarry, wait for it. It will surely come; it will not delay.

(Habakkuk 2:4) 
Behold, the arrogant one is not upright within himself. But the just man will live by his faith.

(Habakkuk 2:5) 
Truly, because of wine, the proud man is arrogant and restless; he does not remain at peace. His soul is as vast as Sheol, like death, and he gathers all nations to himself, like death.

(Habakkuk 2:6) 
Will not all of these take up a parable against him? Will they not utter a riddle concerning him and say, “Woe to him who amasses what is not his own! How long will he keep gathering debts against himself?”

(Habakkuk 2:7) 
Will they not suddenly arise who will bite you, those who will agitate you so fiercely? And you will become their plunder.

(Habakkuk 2:8) 
Because you have plundered many nations, the remnant of the peoples will plunder you for the blood of man and the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all who live in it.

(Habakkuk 2:9) 
Woe to him who gathers evil gain for his house, setting his nest on high to be delivered from the reach of evil!

(Habakkuk 2:10) 
You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples, and you have sinned against your own soul.

(Habakkuk 2:11) 
For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the woodwork will answer.

(Habakkuk 2:12) 
Woe to him who builds a city with blood, and prepares a town with iniquity!

(Habakkuk 2:13) 
Is this not from the Lord of hosts? The peoples labor only for fire, and the nations weary themselves only for nothing.

(Habakkuk 2:14) 
For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

(Habakkuk 2:15) 
Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor, pouring out his venom to make him drunk, so that he may look on his nakedness!

(Habakkuk 2:16) 
You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory. Drink yourself and be uncircumcised! The cup in the Lord’s right hand will come around to you, and utter shame will come upon your glory.

(Habakkuk 2:17) 
For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the beasts will terrify you because of the blood of man and the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all who live in it.

(Habakkuk 2:18) 
Of what use is an idol, since its maker has crafted it? It is an image, a teacher of lies! For the maker trusts in his own work, though he has produced mute idols.

(Habakkuk 2:19) 
Woe to him who says to wood, “Awake!” and to a mute stone, “Arise!” Can it teach? Behold, it is covered with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it.

(Habakkuk 2:20) 
But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him.

(Habakkuk 3:1) 
This is the prayer of the prophet Habakkuk, who had difficulty understanding God.

(Habakkuk 3:2) 
Lord, I heard Your fame, and I was afraid.

(Habakkuk 3:3) 
I considered Your works, and I was filled with awe.

(Habakkuk 3:4) 
Lord, revive Your work as the years pass.

(Habakkuk 3:5) 
As the years pass, make Your power known.

(Habakkuk 3:6) 
Even when my soul is troubled, remember Your mercy.

(Habakkuk 3:7) 
God will come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount Pharan.

(Habakkuk 3:8) 
His glory covered the skies, and the earth is filled with praise of Him.

(Habakkuk 3:9) 
His splendor will be like light: He has all power in His hands.

(Habakkuk 3:10) 
In Him is all strength hidden.

(Habakkuk 3:11) 
Before Him will go pestilence, and the devil will walk before His feet.

(Habakkuk 3:12) 
He stood, and measured the land.

(Habakkuk 3:13) 
He looked, and the nations were terrified.

(Habakkuk 3:14) 
The ancient mountains were crushed, the hills of the world were bowed down, from His eternal paths.

(Habakkuk 3:15) 
Because of iniquity, I saw the tents of Ethiopia; the coverings of the land of Midian were troubled.

(Habakkuk 3:16) 
Were You angry with the rivers, Lord?

(Habakkuk 3:17) 
Was Your fury against the sea?

(Habakkuk 3:18) 
You rode on Your horses, and Your chariots brought salvation.

(Habakkuk 3:19) 
You roused Your bow, and prepared it for battle.

(Habakkuk 3:20) 
You spoke oaths to the tribes.

(Habakkuk 3:21) 
You divided the rivers of the land.

(Habakkuk 3:22) 
The mountains saw You, and were in pain: the torrents of waters passed by.

(Habakkuk 3:23) 
The deep gave forth a sound; the depths sent out their voice.

(Habakkuk 3:24) 
He lifted up His hands to the heights.

(Habakkuk 3:25) 
The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling, at the light of Your arrows they shall go, in the splendor of Your flashing spear.

(Habakkuk 3:26) 
In anger, You trampled the earth; in fury, You destroyed the nations.

(Habakkuk 3:27) 
You went out to save Your people, to save Your people with Your anointed ones.

(Habakkuk 3:28) 
You struck the head from the house of the wicked; You laid bare the foundation even to the neck.

(Habakkuk 3:29) 
You cursed their scepters, the heads of their warriors.

(Habakkuk 3:30) 
You invaded the sea with Your horses, in the tumult of many waters.

(Habakkuk 3:31) 
I heard, and my belly was troubled.

(Habakkuk 3:32) 
At the voice of my lips, trembling entered into my bones, and I trembled.

(Habakkuk 3:33) 
I waited for the day of tribulation, that I may ascend to the people who are girded for battle.

(Habakkuk 3:34) 
For the fig tree will not blossom, and there will be no fruit on the vines.

(Habakkuk 3:35) 
The labor of the olive trees will be in vain, and the vineyards will not give fruit.

(Habakkuk 3:36) 
All the food in the field will fail, and there will be no cattle in the stalls.

(Habakkuk 3:37) 
Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and I will be joyful in God, my Savior.

(Habakkuk 3:38) 
The Lord God is my strength, and He will make my feet like those of the hinds.

(Habakkuk 3:39) 
He will bring me to the heights, where I can sing a song of victory.
