(2 Chronicles 1:1) 
So Solomon, David's son, was firmly established in his kingdom. The Lord his God was with him, and He elevated him to a position of supreme greatness.

(2 Chronicles 1:2) 
Then Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the tribunes, centurions, leaders, and all the judges of Israel, and to the chiefs of the family clans.

(2 Chronicles 1:3) 
And he went with the entire assembly to the high place of Gibeon, where the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God was located, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the wilderness.

(2 Chronicles 1:4) 
But David had already brought the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, and where they had pitched a tent for it—that is, in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 1:5) 
Also, the bronze altar which Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the Tabernacle of the Lord. And Solomon and the entire assembly sought guidance from the Lord there.

(2 Chronicles 1:6) 
And Solomon went up to the bronze altar, which was before the Tabernacle of the Covenant of the Lord, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.

(2 Chronicles 1:7) 
Then, during that very night, God appeared to him, saying: "Ask for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."

(2 Chronicles 1:8) 
And Solomon said: "You have shown great mercy to David my father, and You have made me king in his place."

(2 Chronicles 1:9) 
Now therefore, O Lord God, let Your promise which You spoke to David my father be fulfilled. For You have made me king over Your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth.

(2 Chronicles 1:10) 
Grant me wisdom and understanding, so that I may properly lead and govern Your people. For You are the Judge of this vast multitude of Your people.

(2 Chronicles 1:11) 
So God said to Solomon: "Because this desire was in your heart, and you did not ask for riches, possessions, or glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even for many years of life; but instead you asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge My people, over whom I have made you king:

(2 Chronicles 1:12) 
wisdom and knowledge are now given to you. Moreover, I will also give you riches, possessions, and glory, such that no king before you or after you will ever be your equal."

(2 Chronicles 1:13) 
So Solomon returned from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, and appeared before the Tabernacle of Testimony, and he reigned over Israel.

(2 Chronicles 1:14) 
He then gathered chariots and horsemen for himself, so that he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 1:15) 
The king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in the plains.

(2 Chronicles 1:16) 
Horses were also brought for him from Egypt and from Coa. The king's traders bought them from Coa at a set price.

(2 Chronicles 1:17) 
They would import a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. Likewise, through their hands, they were supplied to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.

(2 Chronicles 2:1) 
King Solomon resolved to build a Temple for the Lord God, and also a palace for himself.

(2 Chronicles 2:2) 
So Solomon counted out 70,000 men to be burden-bearers, and 80,000 men to quarry stones in the mountains, along with 3,600 foremen to supervise them.

(2 Chronicles 2:3) 
He also sent a message to Hiram, king of Tyre, saying: "Just as you helped my father David and sent him cedar timbers to build a palace for himself, a dwelling where he lived,

(2 Chronicles 2:4) 
do the same for me, so that I can build a Temple for the name of the Lord my God. I will consecrate it to Him, and before Him I will burn fragrant incense, and always set out the Bread of the Presence. I will offer burnt offerings morning and evening, and on Sabbaths, new moons, and the solemn feasts of the Lord our God for all time. For these are the required rituals of Israel."

(2 Chronicles 2:5) 
"The Temple that I wish to build is magnificent, because our God is truly greater than all other gods."

(2 Chronicles 2:6) 
"Who then could truly succeed in building a worthy Temple for Him? If the universe and the highest heavens cannot contain Him, how could I possibly build a house for Him? It is only to be a place for burning incense before Him."

(2 Chronicles 2:7) 
"Now, therefore, send me a skilled artisan who knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, scarlet, and blue dyes. He must also be skilled in all kinds of engraving, to work alongside the artisans I already have here in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David prepared."

(2 Chronicles 2:8) 
"Also, send me timbers of cedar, cypress, and pine from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in felling timber there. My servants will work alongside your servants,

(2 Chronicles 2:9) 
so that they can prepare a great quantity of timber for me. For the Temple that I plan to build will be exceedingly great and glorious."

(2 Chronicles 2:10) 
"Furthermore, I will provide your timber-cutting servants with provisions: 20,000 measures of wheat, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 measures of wine, and 20,000 measures of oil."

(2 Chronicles 2:11) 
Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent a letter in reply to Solomon, which said: "Because the Lord loves His people, He has made you king over them."

(2 Chronicles 2:12) 
He added: "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who created the universe and the earth! He has given King David a wise and skilled son, full of discernment and understanding, to build a Temple for the Lord and a palace for himself."

(2 Chronicles 2:13) 
"Therefore I have sent you a highly skilled and knowledgeable artisan, Hiram—my master craftsman."

(2 Chronicles 2:14) 
"He is the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan, and his father was a Tyrian. He is skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, fine linen, and scarlet fabrics. He also knows how to execute every kind of engraving and to skillfully devise whatever is needed for any work, alongside your artisans and the artisans of my lord David, your father."

(2 Chronicles 2:15) 
"Now then, my lord, send to your servants the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that you promised."

(2 Chronicles 2:16) 
"For our part, we will cut timber from Lebanon as much as is needed, and we will bring it in rafts by sea to Joppa. It will then be your responsibility to transport it from there to Jerusalem."

(2 Chronicles 2:17) 
So Solomon then took a census of all the foreign residents who were in the land of Israel, following the count that his father David had previously made, and he found there were 153,600 such men.

(2 Chronicles 2:18) 
And from these men, he appointed 70,000 to be burden-bearers, 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, and 3,600 to serve as overseers for the work of the people.

(2 Chronicles 3:1) 
So King Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah. This was the very site that had been revealed to his father David, in the exact place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

(2 Chronicles 3:2) 
He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.

(2 Chronicles 3:3) 
These are the foundational measurements that King Solomon laid out for building the Temple of God: the length was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.

(2 Chronicles 3:4) 
The vestibule that was at the front of the Temple was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the main building, and its height was one hundred twenty cubits. He covered its interior with pure gold.

(2 Chronicles 3:5) 
He covered the main Temple hall with fir wood planks, and he decorated it with plates of the purest gold. On these surfaces, he carved palm trees and ornamental chains in relief.

(2 Chronicles 3:6) 
He also laid the floor of the Temple with the most precious gold, and he covered the walls with planks.

(2 Chronicles 3:7) 
He covered the Temple building itself, along with its coffered ceilings, doorposts, and doors, with gold. And on these surfaces, he carved cherubim.

(2 Chronicles 3:8) 
He also made the Most Holy Place. Its length was twenty cubits, matching the width of the main hall, and its width was likewise twenty cubits. He covered it with plates of the finest gold, using approximately six hundred talents of gold for this.

(2 Chronicles 3:9) 
He also made golden nails, each weighing fifty shekels. He covered the inner sections of the Temple with gold.

(2 Chronicles 3:10) 
He also made two sculpted cherubim in the Most Holy Place and covered them with gold.

(2 Chronicles 3:11) 
The wings of the cherubim each measured twenty cubits in total span. One wing, ten cubits long, stretched to touch the wall of the Temple, while the other wing, also ten cubits long, reached to touch the wing of the other cherub.

(2 Chronicles 3:12) 
Similarly, one wing of the other cherub, ten cubits long, extended to the wall, and its other wing, also ten cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.

(2 Chronicles 3:13) 
Thus, the wings of both cherubim, when fully spread, spanned the entire twenty-cubit width of the Most Holy Place. The cherubim themselves stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned towards the main hall of the Temple.

(2 Chronicles 3:14) 
He also made a veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, and skillfully wove cherubim into its design.

(2 Chronicles 3:15) 
In front of the Temple entrance, he also made two columns, each thirty-five cubits high, with their capitals each five cubits high.

(2 Chronicles 3:16) 
He also made chains for the embellishment of the Temple entrance and placed them on the tops of the columns. He also made one hundred pomegranates and interspersed them among the chains.

(2 Chronicles 3:17) 
He then set these columns in the Temple vestibule, one on the right side and the other on the left side. He named the column on the right 'Jachin', and the column on the left 'Boaz'.

(2 Chronicles 4:1) 
Solomon also made a bronze altar. It was twenty cubits (approximately 18 inches each) in length, twenty cubits in width, and ten cubits in height.

(2 Chronicles 4:2) 
Then he made the great Molten Sea (a large basin) for ritual washing. It was circular, ten cubits from rim to rim, and five cubits high. A measuring cord of thirty cubits could encompass its entire circumference.

(2 Chronicles 4:3) 
Beneath its rim were decorative figures resembling oxen. These new sculptures were cast as part of a continuous band encircling the Molten Sea, with ten figures per cubit of its circumference, forming a relief decoration.

(2 Chronicles 4:4) 
Twelve oxen supported the Molten Sea. Three of these oxen faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The Molten Sea rested upon their backs, with their hindquarters hidden beneath it.

(2 Chronicles 4:5) 
The walls of the Molten Sea were four fingers thick. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, flaring out like a lily blossom. It was designed to hold three thousand liquid measures.

(2 Chronicles 4:6) 
He also made ten lavers (smaller basins). He placed five of these lavers on the right side of the temple and five on the left. These were for washing the animals designated for burnt offerings, so that all parts pertaining to the sacrifice would be purified there. The large Molten Sea, however, was reserved for the ritual ablutions of the priests and Levites.

(2 Chronicles 4:7) 
Solomon also had ten golden candlesticks made, crafted according to the precise form God had commanded. He placed them within the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.

(2 Chronicles 4:8) 
He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple: five on the right and five on the left. In addition, he made one hundred golden bowls (or basins).

(2 Chronicles 4:9) 
He also constructed the inner court for the priests, and the great outer court. The doors for these courts were covered with bronze.

(2 Chronicles 4:10) 
Furthermore, he placed the Molten Sea on the right side of the temple, in the eastern part, facing south.

(2 Chronicles 4:11) 
So Hiram, the master craftsman, made all the necessary pots, shovels, and basins. He completed all the work the king had entrusted him with for the House of God.

(2 Chronicles 4:12) 
Hiram crafted the two large bronze pillars, along with their decorative crowns and chapiters, which were placed above the pillar tops. He also made four latticework networks, designed to cover both the two crowns and the chapiters that adorned the tops of the pillars.

(2 Chronicles 4:13) 
Additionally, he made four hundred pomegranates for the two networks. These were arranged in two rows of pomegranates that encircled each of the crowns and the chapiters of the pillars.

(2 Chronicles 4:14) 
Moreover, Hiram made the movable stands for the lavers, and the lavers themselves, which were placed upon these stands.

(2 Chronicles 4:15) 
He made the one large Molten Sea, along with the twelve oxen positioned beneath it.

(2 Chronicles 4:16) 
He also crafted the pots, shovels, and fleshhooks. All these vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon for the House of the Lord, were fashioned from the purest bronze.

(2 Chronicles 4:17) 
The king cast these bronze items in the clay ground throughout the region of the Jordan, specifically between Succoth and Zeredah.

(2 Chronicles 4:18) 
Solomon had all these vessels made in exceedingly great quantity. Indeed, the total weight of the bronze could not be calculated.

(2 Chronicles 4:19) 
So Solomon commissioned and had made all the furnishings for the House of God: the golden altar of incense, and the tables upon which the showbread (or bread of the Presence) was placed.

(2 Chronicles 4:20) 
He also had the candlesticks made with their lamps, so that they might shine before the entrance of the inner sanctuary, according to the prescribed custom. These were made from the purest gold.

(2 Chronicles 4:21) 
And he had all the decorative golden flowers (blossoms), and the lamps themselves, and the golden tongs made from the purest gold.

(2 Chronicles 4:22) 
He also made the golden bowls, censers, and sprinkling basins. Additionally, he made the golden doors for the inner temple leading to the Holy of Holies, and the golden doors for the main entrance of the outer temple. All these things Hiram contributed to the making of for the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 5:1) 
Thus, all the work that Solomon did for the house of the Lord was completed. And Solomon brought in all the things that his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the various vessels—and placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.

(2 Chronicles 5:2) 
After this, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the chiefs of the tribes, and the heads of the families of the sons of Israel, in Jerusalem. He gathered them to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.

(2 Chronicles 5:3) 
So all the men of Israel came together to the king on the solemn feast day of the seventh month.

(2 Chronicles 5:4) 
When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites carried the ark.

(2 Chronicles 5:5) 
And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the sacred vessels that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites carried these items.

(2 Chronicles 5:6) 
But King Solomon, and the entire assembly of Israel who had gathered before him, in front of the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen beyond all counting. For the multitude of the sacrificial offerings was so great.

(2 Chronicles 5:7) 
Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its designated place—that is, into the inner sanctuary of the Temple, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.

(2 Chronicles 5:8) 
For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, thereby protecting both the ark itself and its carrying poles.

(2 Chronicles 5:9) 
Now, as for the poles by which the ark was carried, because they were somewhat long, their ends were visible from outside the inner sanctuary, from the place before the Holy Place, but they did not protrude further into view. The ends of the other poles were not visible at all. Therefore, the ark remained there until the present day.

(2 Chronicles 5:10) 
There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses had placed there at Horeb. This was when the Lord gave the Law to the children of Israel as they were coming out of Egypt.

(2 Chronicles 5:11) 
Now the priests departed from the sanctuary. All the priests who were present had sanctified themselves for service, for at that time, the division of families and their assigned ministries was not yet strictly observed.

(2 Chronicles 5:12) 
The Levites, who also served as singers—namely, those under Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, along with their sons and their relatives—were dressed in fine linen. They stood with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, making music, positioned on the east side of the altar. With them were one hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets.

(2 Chronicles 5:13) 
So, when all of them were sounding in unison—with trumpets, and voices, and cymbals, and other instruments, and all sorts of musicians playing together—they raised their voices high according to the melodies of the songs. They were giving thanks to the Lord, saying 'For He is good, for His mercy endures forever.' Then the house of the Lord was filled with a cloud of the Lord's majesty—a visible manifestation of God’s glory.

(2 Chronicles 5:14) 
And the priests were not able to stand and minister there because of the dense cloud and darkness. For the glory of the Lord had completely filled the house of God.

(2 Chronicles 6:1) 
Then Solomon spoke, saying: “The Lord has indeed declared that He would dwell within thick, mysterious darkness.”

(2 Chronicles 6:2) 
But I have built a sacred house to honor Your Name, so that Your presence may dwell there always and eternally.

(2 Chronicles 6:3) 
And the king turned his attention and faced the entire assembly of Israel, and he blessed them. All of the people of Israel were standing at this time.

(2 Chronicles 6:4) 
And Solomon said: 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to my father David, and has now fulfilled His promise through His actions, saying:'

(2 Chronicles 6:5) 
'From the day I led My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose any city from all the tribes of Israel for a house to be built in it for My Name. Nor did I choose any man to be a leader over My people, Israel.'

(2 Chronicles 6:6) 
'But I chose Jerusalem for My Name to be there always, and I chose David to rule over My people, Israel.'

(2 Chronicles 6:7) 
And my father David desired to build a house to honor the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 6:8) 
However, the Lord said to him: 'Because you desired to build a house for My Name, you did well in having this intention in your heart.'

(2 Chronicles 6:9) 
'Nevertheless, you yourself shall not build the house. Instead, your son, who will come forth from your body, he shall build the house for My Name.'

(2 Chronicles 6:10) 
So the Lord has fulfilled His word which He had spoken. And I have risen up in place of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord had promised. And I have built this house for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 6:11) 
And within this house, I have placed the Ark of the Covenant, in which is the covenant of the Lord that He made with the children of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 6:12) 
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, facing the entire assembly of Israel, and he stretched out his hands.

(2 Chronicles 6:13) 
For Solomon had previously built a bronze platform and placed it in the middle of the outer courtyard. This platform was five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. Solomon then stood upon it, and before the entire assembly of Israel, he knelt down upon his knees and lifted his hands towards the sky.

(2 Chronicles 6:14) 
And he said: 'O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, neither in the sky nor on the earth! You faithfully keep Your covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.

(2 Chronicles 6:15) 
You have fulfilled for Your servant David, my father, what You spoke to him, and You have brought it to pass through Your actions, just as it is proven this very day.

(2 Chronicles 6:16) 
Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David, my father, what You spoke to him, saying: “There shall never fail to be a man from you before My sight, who sits upon the throne of Israel, provided that your sons guard My ways and walk in My law, just as you have walked before Me.”'

(2 Chronicles 6:17) 
'And now, O Lord, God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You spoke to Your servant David.'

(2 Chronicles 6:18) 
'But is it truly to be believed that God would actually dwell with human beings upon the earth? For if the sky and the highest heavens cannot contain You, how much less can this house that I have built?'

(2 Chronicles 6:19) 
'However, this house has been built only for this purpose: that You would look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord, my God, and that You would hear the praise and the prayer that Your servant prays before You.'

(2 Chronicles 6:20) 
'May Your eyes be open upon this house day and night, upon this place where You promised that Your Name would be invoked.'

(2 Chronicles 6:21) 
'May You hear the prayers that Your servant and Your people Israel pray in this place. And hear us from Your exalted dwelling place, from the very sky, and when You hear us, be merciful.'

(2 Chronicles 6:22) 
'If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is imposed upon him, compelling him to swear against himself, and each one comes to Your altar in this house, and there curses himself to attest to his innocence;'

(2 Chronicles 6:23) 
'then You shall hear from the sky, and You shall execute judgment. You will judge Your servants, returning to the wicked man his own way, and justifying the righteous man, repaying him according to his own justice.'

(2 Chronicles 6:24) 
'If an enemy attacks Your people Israel, and they turn to You and supplicate You in this house, confessing Your Name;'

(2 Chronicles 6:25) 
'then You shall hear from the sky, and be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and bring them back into the land that You gave to their fathers.'

(2 Chronicles 6:26) 
'If the sky is closed, and rain does not fall because of their sins, and they supplicate You in this place, and confess Your Name, and turn from their sins, when You have afflicted them;'

(2 Chronicles 6:27) 
'then You shall hear from the sky, O Lord, and be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and teach them the good way in which they ought to walk. And give rain to Your land, which You gave to Your people as a possession.'

(2 Chronicles 6:28) 
'If there is famine in the land, or pestilence, blight, mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; or if enemies lay waste to their regions and besiege their cities at their borders: whatever plague, whatever infirmity they suffer.'

(2 Chronicles 6:29) 
'If anyone prays, and there is a supplication from any man, or from all of Your people Israel, each person knowing his own plague and his own infirmity, and extends his hands towards this house;'

(2 Chronicles 6:30) 
'then You shall hear from the sky, indeed, from Your exalted dwelling place, and You will be merciful. You will repay each person according to his own ways, which You know in his heart, because You alone know the hearts of the children of men.'

(2 Chronicles 6:31) 
'This is so they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days that they live upon the face of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.'

(2 Chronicles 6:32) 
'Furthermore, if a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, comes from a distant land because of Your great Name, and because of Your strong hand, and Your outstretched arm, and worships in this place;'

(2 Chronicles 6:33) 
'then You shall hear from the most secure sky, Your dwelling place, and You shall do everything that foreigner asks of You. This is so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your Name and fear You, just as Your people Israel do, and acknowledge that Your Name is invoked over this house which I have built.'

(2 Chronicles 6:34) 
'If Your people go out to war against their adversaries by the way in which You send them, and they pray to You facing this way, towards this city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your Name;'

(2 Chronicles 6:35) 
'then You shall hear their prayer and supplications from the sky, and You shall execute judgment.'

(2 Chronicles 6:36) 
'If they sin against You (for there is no human being who does not sin), and You become angry with them and deliver them to their enemies, and they are led captive into a distant land or a nearby one;'

(2 Chronicles 6:37) 
'and if they turn in their heart in the land to which they were led captive, and do penance, and supplicate You in the land of their captivity, saying: “We have sinned, we have acted wickedly, we have done unjustly”;'

(2 Chronicles 6:38) 
'and if they return to You with all their heart and all their soul, in the land of their captivity to which they were led, and they worship You facing the way of their land which You gave to their fathers, and the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your Name;'

(2 Chronicles 6:39) 
'then You shall hear their prayer and supplications from the sky, indeed, from Your most secure dwelling place, and You shall execute judgment, and You will be merciful to Your people, even though they are sinners.'

(2 Chronicles 6:40) 
'Now, O Lord, my God, I beseech You, let Your eyes be open, and Your ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.'

(2 Chronicles 7:1) 
When Solomon had finished offering his prayers, a great fire came down from the sky. This fire consumed the burnt offerings and all the other sacrifices, and the Lord's glory filled the Temple.

(2 Chronicles 7:2) 
The priests were unable to enter the Lord's Temple, because the magnificent glory of the Lord had completely filled the entire Temple.

(2 Chronicles 7:3) 
All the children of Israel also saw the fire come down and the Lord's glory resting upon the Temple. They bowed low, with their faces to the ground, and adored and praised the Lord, exclaiming: 'He is good, and His mercy endures for all eternity!'

(2 Chronicles 7:4) 
Then King Solomon and all the people began to offer sacrifices before the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 7:5) 
So King Solomon offered as sacrifices twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. In this way, the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God.

(2 Chronicles 7:6) 
The priests stood in their appointed places, and the Levites were there with the musical instruments of the Lord that King David had made to praise the Lord with the hymn 'For His mercy endures forever.' The Levites were singing David's hymns with their instruments, while the priests blew trumpets before them. All of Israel stood reverently during this.

(2 Chronicles 7:7) 
Solomon also consecrated the middle section of the courtyard, the part directly in front of the Lord's Temple. This was because he had offered burnt offerings there, along with the fat from the peace offerings, as the bronze altar Solomon had made was not large enough to hold all the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fat.

(2 Chronicles 7:8) 
So Solomon celebrated a great feast for seven days at that time, and all Israel was with him—a vast multitude gathered from the far northern entrance of Hamath down to the River of Egypt in the south.

(2 Chronicles 7:9) 
On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly. This was after they had spent seven days completing the dedication of the altar, and then another seven days celebrating the feast.

(2 Chronicles 7:10) 
So, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes. They were full of joy and cheer, grateful for all the good the Lord had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people, Israel.

(2 Chronicles 7:11) 
Solomon thus completed the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace. Everything he had planned in his heart to build for the Lord's Temple and for his own house, he successfully brought to a prosperous completion.

(2 Chronicles 7:12) 
The Lord appeared to Solomon during the night and said: 'I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this very place for Myself to be a house of sacrifice.'

(2 Chronicles 7:13) 
If I were to close up the sky so that no rain falls, or if I were to command the locusts to devour the earth, or if I were to send a plague among My people, these would be the consequences of their actions.

(2 Chronicles 7:14) 
If My people, who are called by My name, turn away from their wicked ways, and pray to Me, and seek My face, and repent, then I will hear them from My dwelling place above. I will forgive their sins, and I will heal their land.

(2 Chronicles 7:15) 
My eyes will also be open, and My ears attentive to the prayer of anyone who prays in this very place, the Temple.

(2 Chronicles 7:16) 
For I have chosen and sanctified this place, so that My name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart will remain there perpetually.

(2 Chronicles 7:17) 
As for you, if you walk before Me just as David your father walked, and you do everything I have commanded you, and you uphold My judgments and My commandments, then I will bless your reign.

(2 Chronicles 7:18) 
I will establish your royal throne, just as I promised David your father, saying: 'There shall never fail a man of your lineage to rule over Israel.'

(2 Chronicles 7:19) 
But if you turn away and forsake My commandments and My sacred ceremonies, which I have given you, and instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them, then dire consequences will follow.

(2 Chronicles 7:20) 
I will uproot you from My land, which I have given to you. And this Temple, which I have sanctified for My name, I will cast away from My sight. I will make it a proverb and a byword among all nations.

(2 Chronicles 7:21) 
And this Temple will become a proverb to all who pass by. They will say: 'Why has the Lord done this to this land and to this Temple?'

(2 Chronicles 7:22) 
And the answer will be: 'Because they abandoned the Lord God of their fathers, who led them out of the land of Egypt. They embraced foreign gods, worshipped them, and served them. That is why all these terrible evils have come upon them.'

(2 Chronicles 8:1) 
After twenty years, during which King Solomon built the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace,

(2 Chronicles 8:2) 
King Solomon then rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given to him, and he settled the people of Israel there.

(2 Chronicles 8:3) 
King Solomon also went to Hamath-Zobah and took possession of it.

(2 Chronicles 8:4) 
He built up Tadmor in the desert, as well as all the store cities that he had established in Hamath.

(2 Chronicles 8:5) 
He also rebuilt Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon, fortifying them as cities with walls, gates, and strong bars for security.

(2 Chronicles 8:6) 
He likewise rebuilt Baalath and all the other fortified cities that belonged to King Solomon. He built all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his cavalry, and everything else that King Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the lands under his control.

(2 Chronicles 8:7) 
All the people who remained from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—those who were not from the lineage of Israel—

(2 Chronicles 8:8) 
whose descendants were left in the land, and whom the people of Israel had not destroyed completely—King Solomon made them perform forced labor, and they continue to pay tribute to this very day.

(2 Chronicles 8:9) 
However, King Solomon did not make any of the people of Israel perform such forced royal labor. For they were his soldiers, his chief officers, his commanders of chariots, and his cavalry.

(2 Chronicles 8:10) 
All the chief officers of King Solomon's army numbered two hundred fifty men, and these were the ones who instructed the people.

(2 Chronicles 8:11) 
King Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter from the City of David into the royal palace he had built for her. For the king said: "My wife must not live in the house of King David of Israel, because that place is made holy, for the Ark of the Lord has entered it."

(2 Chronicles 8:12) 
Then King Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord upon the Lord's altar, which he had built in front of the Temple portico.

(2 Chronicles 8:13) 
He did this so that the daily prescribed offerings would be fulfilled according to the ritual requirements for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual solemn feasts: namely, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.

(2 Chronicles 8:14) 
He appointed the priests to their designated duties according to the arrangement of his father, King David, and the Levites to their various orders, to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the ritual of each day. He also appointed the gatekeepers to their divisions for each gate, for so had David, the man of God, commanded.

(2 Chronicles 8:15) 
The priests and Levites did not deviate from any of the king's commands concerning all that he had ordered, whether for the treasuries or for the daily service.

(2 Chronicles 8:16) 
Thus, all of King Solomon's work was completed, from the day the Lord's Temple was founded until the day it was finished.

(2 Chronicles 8:17) 
At that time, King Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Elath, which are on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.

(2 Chronicles 8:18) 
King Hiram then sent ships to King Solomon by the hand of his servants, along with sailors who were skilled in seafaring. These sailors, with King Solomon's servants, went to Ophir and brought back from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.

(2 Chronicles 9:1) 
The Queen of Sheba, having heard of King Solomon’s great fame and wisdom, came to Jerusalem to test him with many difficult questions. She arrived with a magnificent procession, including camels carrying a vast amount of spices, very much gold, and many precious jewels. When she was brought before Solomon, she spoke to him about everything she had pondered in her heart.

(2 Chronicles 9:2) 
But King Solomon explained to her every question she had presented. There was nothing he did not answer clearly, showing his great wisdom.

(2 Chronicles 9:3) 
Therefore, the Queen of Sheba personally observed the profound wisdom of King Solomon. She also saw the magnificent royal palace that he had built for himself.

(2 Chronicles 9:4) 
She observed the lavish food served at his royal table, the orderly living quarters of his servants, the meticulous service and splendid clothing of his ministers, and the excellent service and attire of his cupbearers. She also witnessed the magnificent burnt offerings that King Solomon regularly presented in the Temple of the Lord. All these sights were so overwhelming that she was left utterly astonished and completely breathless.

(2 Chronicles 9:5) 
She then said to the king: “The report I heard in my own land concerning your accomplishments and your wisdom is truly accurate.

(2 Chronicles 9:6) 
I did not believe those who told me, until I came myself and saw with my own eyes. Now I see that not even half of your wisdom had been reported to me; your actual achievements far exceed your reputation.”

(2 Chronicles 9:7) 
Blessed are your men who serve you, and blessed are your female servants who always stand before you and listen to your wisdom. They are truly fortunate.

(2 Chronicles 9:8) 
May the Lord your God be blessed, for He was pleased to place you upon His throne, making you king for the Lord your God. He has done this so you may execute judgment and administer justice for His people.

(2 Chronicles 9:9) 
Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, an extremely large quantity of spices, and many very precious gems. Never before had there been such a great quantity of spices as the Queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.

(2 Chronicles 9:10) 
Moreover, Hiram’s servants, along with Solomon’s own servants, brought gold from Ophir. They also brought sandalwood — a very fine timber — and highly valuable gems.

(2 Chronicles 9:11) 
From this precious timber, the king made steps for the Temple of the Lord and for the royal palace. He also made lyres and harps for the musicians. Nothing like these had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 9:12) 
King Solomon also gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and requested from him, in addition to what she had brought to him as gifts. After receiving these, she returned and departed to her own land with her servants.

(2 Chronicles 9:13) 
Now, the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon each year amounted to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.

(2 Chronicles 9:14) 
This was in addition to what laypeople and merchants brought, and what all the kings of Arabia and the governors of various lands contributed by bringing gold and silver to Solomon.

(2 Chronicles 9:15) 
So King Solomon made two hundred large shields — or spears — of beaten gold. Each one contained six hundred shekels of gold.

(2 Chronicles 9:16) 
He also made three hundred smaller shields of beaten gold; each of these contained three hundred shekels of gold. The king placed these in the armory that was known as the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

(2 Chronicles 9:17) 
The king also made a large ivory throne, which he overlaid with the purest gold.

(2 Chronicles 9:18) 
There were six steps leading up to the throne. There was also a golden footstool permanently attached to the throne. It had armrests on both sides, and two statues of lions stood beside these armrests.

(2 Chronicles 9:19) 
Additionally, twelve lion cubs stood on the six steps, one on each side of each step. There was no throne like it in any of the kingdoms of the world.

(2 Chronicles 9:20) 
All the drinking vessels used for King Solomon’s banquets were made of gold. And all the utensils and furnishings in the House of the Forest of Lebanon were made of pure gold. In those days, silver was considered to be of no value.

(2 Chronicles 9:21) 
This was because the king’s ships sailed to Tarshish with Hiram’s servants once every three years. From there, they brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.

(2 Chronicles 9:22) 
So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in both his immense wealth and his profound wisdom.

(2 Chronicles 9:23) 
All the kings of the earth sought to meet Solomon personally, so they could hear the wisdom that God had placed in his heart.

(2 Chronicles 9:24) 
Each one of them brought him gifts: articles of silver and gold, splendid garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, year after year.

(2 Chronicles 9:25) 
Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for his horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. These were stationed in the chariot cities and also with the king in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 9:26) 
He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River, extending as far as the land of the Philistines, and all the way to the borders of Egypt.

(2 Chronicles 9:27) 
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as ordinary stones. And he made cedar wood as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in great numbers in the lowlands.

(2 Chronicles 9:28) 
Horses were brought to him from Egypt and from all other regions.

(2 Chronicles 9:29) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Solomon, both his early and his later deeds, are recorded in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the books of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.

(2 Chronicles 9:30) 
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.

(2 Chronicles 9:31) 
Then Solomon rested with his ancestors in death, and they buried him in the City of David. His son Rehoboam then became king in his place.

(2 Chronicles 10:1) 
Rehoboam went to Shechem. This was because all of Israel had come there to make him king.

(2 Chronicles 10:2) 
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, heard about this. He had been in Egypt, having fled there from King Solomon. He immediately returned from Egypt.

(2 Chronicles 10:3) 
So they sent for him and called him. Jeroboam came, and all of Israel came with him. They spoke to Rehoboam, saying:

(2 Chronicles 10:4) 
'Your father made our forced labor very hard. Now, lighten a little of this very harsh service and the heavy burden he put on us, and we will serve you.'

(2 Chronicles 10:5) 
He answered them, saying, 'Return to me after three days.' So the people went away.

(2 Chronicles 10:6) 
King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had advised his father, King Solomon, during his lifetime. He asked them, 'What advice do you give me so I can respond to these people?'

(2 Chronicles 10:7) 
They said to him, 'If you will be good to this people, and will please them by speaking gentle words to them, they will be your servants always.'

(2 Chronicles 10:8) 
But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders. Instead, he spoke with the young men who had grown up with him and were always around him.

(2 Chronicles 10:9) 
He asked them, 'What advice do you give? How should I answer these people who have asked me to lighten the heavy burden that my father placed on us?'

(2 Chronicles 10:10) 
The young men answered him, giving their advice: 'Tell the people who spoke to you, saying, "Your father made our forced labor heavy, but you lighten it," say this to them: "My little finger is thicker than my father's loins."'

(2 Chronicles 10:11) 
'And now, my father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will make it even heavier. My father punished you with regular whips, but I will punish you with whips that have sharp points.'

(2 Chronicles 10:12) 
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had commanded when he said, 'Return to me on the third day.'

(2 Chronicles 10:13) 
The king answered them harshly, having rejected the good counsel given by the elders.

(2 Chronicles 10:14) 
And he spoke according to the wishes of the young men, saying, 'My father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will add even more to it. My father punished you with regular whips, but I will punish you with whips that have sharp points.'

(2 Chronicles 10:15) 
But King Rehoboam did not listen to the people's plea. This turn of events was from God, so that the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat, might be fulfilled.

(2 Chronicles 10:16) 
When all of Israel saw that King Rehoboam refused to listen to them, the people answered him, saying, 'We have no share in David! We have no inheritance with the son of Jesse—that is, King David! Go to your own homes, Israel! You, David, see to your own house now.' And all the people of Israel went to their homes.

(2 Chronicles 10:17) 
But Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 10:18) 
Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor. But the people of Israel stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam quickly got into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 10:19) 
And Israel has been separated from the house of David from that day until the present.

(2 Chronicles 11:1) 
After this, Rehoboam went to Jerusalem. He called together all the fighting men from the Tribe of Judah and the Tribe of Benjamin—one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors—so that he could fight against the northern kingdom of Israel and bring it back under his rule.

(2 Chronicles 11:2) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a prophet of God, saying:

(2 Chronicles 11:3) 
 'Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and king of Judah, and to all the Israelites who are living in the territories of Judah and Benjamin:

(2 Chronicles 11:4) 
 'The Lord says this: Do not march up to fight against your own brothers, the northern Israelites. Everyone should return to his own home, because this division happened by My will.' So, when they heard the Lord's message, they turned back from their campaign and did not go to war against Jeroboam.

(2 Chronicles 11:5) 
Rehoboam then stayed in Jerusalem and built fortified cities throughout Judah.

(2 Chronicles 11:6) 
He built up Bethlehem, Etham, and Tekoa,

(2 Chronicles 11:7) 
as well as Beth-zur, Soco, and Adullam,

(2 Chronicles 11:8) 
and also Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph,

(2 Chronicles 11:9) 
along with Adoraim, Lachish, and Azekah,

(2 Chronicles 11:10) 
and Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were strong, fortified cities in the territories of Judah and Benjamin.

(2 Chronicles 11:11) 
After fortifying these cities, he put commanders in charge of them and stored supplies of food, including olive oil and wine.

(2 Chronicles 11:12) 
In each of these cities, he also placed shields and spears, making them extremely well-fortified. So, he established his reign over Judah and Benjamin.

(2 Chronicles 11:13) 
Also, the priests and the Levites who lived throughout all the regions of the northern kingdom of Israel came to him [in Judah].

(2 Chronicles 11:14) 
They left their pasture lands and their possessions, crossing over into Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 11:15) 
Instead, Jeroboam had appointed his own priests for the pagan high places, for idol worship, and for the calf idols which he had made.

(2 Chronicles 11:16) 
Moreover, from all the tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel, anyone who earnestly sought to worship the Lord, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 11:17) 
Thus, the kingdom of Judah was strengthened, and Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was established in power for three years, because for those three years, they followed in the ways of David and Solomon.

(2 Chronicles 11:18) 
Rehoboam then married Mahalath, who was the daughter of Jerimoth, David's son. He also married Abihail, who was the daughter of Eliab, Jesse's son.

(2 Chronicles 11:19) 
She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.

(2 Chronicles 11:20) 
After this, he also married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.

(2 Chronicles 11:21) 
Rehoboam loved Maacah, Absalom's daughter, more than all his other wives and concubines. Indeed, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and through them, he became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.

(2 Chronicles 11:22) 
He appointed Abijah, Maacah's son, as the chief leader among all his brothers, intending to make him king.

(2 Chronicles 11:23) 
Therefore, Rehoboam wisely made arrangements and distributed all his sons throughout all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, placing them in fortified cities. He gave them generous provisions and also many wives.

(2 Chronicles 12:1) 
Once Rehoboam’s kingdom had become strong and established, he abandoned the Lord, and all of Israel followed him in this sin.

(2 Chronicles 12:2) 
In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem because Rehoboam and Israel had abandoned the Lord. Shishak came with two hundred forty chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. The number of foot soldiers who came with him from Egypt was countless; this army included Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians.

(2 Chronicles 12:3) 
He captured the fortified cities in Judah and advanced all the way to Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 12:4) 
Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah, who had gathered in Jerusalem, having fled from Shishak. He told them, 'Thus says the Lord: You have abandoned me, and for that reason, I have now abandoned you into the power of Shishak.'

(2 Chronicles 12:5) 
Then Rehoboam and the princes of Israel humbled themselves and declared, 'The Lord is just in this judgment.'

(2 Chronicles 12:6) 
When the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying: 'Because they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them. Instead, I will grant them a little help, and my wrath will not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.'

(2 Chronicles 12:7) 
Nevertheless, they will become Shishak’s servants, so that they may understand the difference between serving me and serving the kingdoms of this world.

(2 Chronicles 12:8) 
So Shishak, the king of Egypt, entered Jerusalem and took away the treasures from the house of the Lord and the royal palace treasures. He carried everything away with him, including the golden shields that Solomon had made.

(2 Chronicles 12:9) 
In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the commanders of the guards and those who guarded the palace gates.

(2 Chronicles 12:10) 
Whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guards would carry these shields, and afterwards, they would return them to their armory.

(2 Chronicles 12:11) 
Nevertheless, because Rehoboam had humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned away from him; his realm was not utterly destroyed. Indeed, there were still some good deeds found among the people of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 12:12) 
So King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to have His name invoked there.

(2 Chronicles 12:13) 
His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.

(2 Chronicles 12:14) 
However, Rehoboam did evil, and he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 12:15) 
Now, the first and last deeds of Rehoboam are written in the books of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer. These accounts were written with diligent detail, including genealogies. There was also continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.

(2 Chronicles 12:16) 
So Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah then reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 12:17) 
In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s reign, Abijah began to reign over Judah.

(2 Chronicles 12:18) 
He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah, daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

(2 Chronicles 12:19) 
When the battle lines were drawn, Abijah went forth with four hundred thousand very strong and skilled warriors. Jeroboam also arrayed against him an army of eight hundred thousand strong and mighty men.

(2 Chronicles 12:20) 
Abijah then stood upon Mount Zemaraim, which is in Ephraim, and said, 'Hear me, Jeroboam, and all of Israel!'

(2 Chronicles 12:21) 
Do you not know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? (A covenant of salt is a perpetual and unbreakable agreement).

(2 Chronicles 12:22) 
Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon, the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his own master.

(2 Chronicles 12:23) 
Worthless men, sons of Belial, gathered to him and prevailed against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. For Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted and could not stand against them.

(2 Chronicles 12:24) 
And now you intend to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which He possesses through the sons of David? You have a countless multitude of men, and also the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.

(2 Chronicles 12:25) 
Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? Instead, you have made priests for yourselves according to the customs of all the other nations. Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams becomes a priest for those who are not truly gods.

(2 Chronicles 12:26) 
But for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not abandoned Him. The priests ministering to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron, and the Levites serve in their proper duties.

(2 Chronicles 12:27) 
And we burn to the Lord every single day the morning and evening burnt offering, and aromatic incense. We set out the bread upon the pure table and have the golden lampstand with its lamps, so that they may be lit in the evening. For we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, but you have abandoned them.

(2 Chronicles 12:28) 
Therefore, God is our leader in our army, and our priests are with us, to sound the trumpets and shout against you. Sons of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers, for it will not go well for you.

(2 Chronicles 12:29) 
Nevertheless, Jeroboam, by setting ambushes behind Judah's army, surrounded them. While his main army was in front, other ambushes were behind them.

(2 Chronicles 12:30) 
So when Judah turned and saw the battle coming from both in front and behind, they cried out to the Lord, and the priests began to sound their trumpets.

(2 Chronicles 12:31) 
Every man of Judah also shouted. And behold, while the priests blasted their trumpets and all together shouted with a mighty cry, God did not conceal Himself from their adversaries.

(2 Chronicles 12:32) 
Therefore, God struck down Jeroboam and all of Israel in the presence of Abijah and Judah.

(2 Chronicles 12:33) 
The sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.

(2 Chronicles 12:34) 
So Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter, and five hundred thousand strong men of Israel fell, mortally wounded.

(2 Chronicles 12:35) 
The sons of Israel were humbled at that time, but the sons of Judah were strengthened, because they had relied upon the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 12:36) 
Abijah pursued Jeroboam as he fled and captured his cities: Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah with its surrounding towns, and Ephron with its surrounding towns.

(2 Chronicles 12:37) 
So Jeroboam could no longer regain his strength in the days of Abijah. The Lord struck him, and he died.

(2 Chronicles 12:38) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his deeds, are written very diligently in the book of Iddo the prophet.

(2 Chronicles 12:39) 
Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa then reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 12:40) 
In his days, the land was at peace for ten years.

(2 Chronicles 13:1) 
In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign, Abijah began his reign over Judah.

(2 Chronicles 13:2) 
He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And there was a major war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

(2 Chronicles 13:3) 
Abijah prepared for battle with two hundred thousand mighty and experienced warriors. Jeroboam, on the other hand, drew up his battle line with eight hundred thousand strong and valiant men.

(2 Chronicles 13:4) 
Then Abijah took his stand on Mount Zemaraim, which was in Ephraim, and he declared: "Hear me, Jeroboam, and all of Israel!"

(2 Chronicles 13:5) 
Do you not know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever—to him and his sons—by a perpetual covenant of salt?

(2 Chronicles 13:6) 
Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon, David's son, rose up and rebelled against his own master.

(2 Chronicles 13:7) 
And worthless men, sons of utter wickedness, gathered to him and gained power against Rehoboam, Solomon's son. Rehoboam was then young and timid, and he could not resist them.

(2 Chronicles 13:8) 
And now you say that you can resist the kingdom of the Lord, which He rules through the sons of David. You are indeed a very great multitude, but you have with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made for you as gods.

(2 Chronicles 13:9) 
Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And have you not made priests for yourselves according to the pagan customs of all the nations of the earth? Whoever came and consecrated himself with a young bull and seven rams became a priest for those who are not truly gods.

(2 Chronicles 13:10) 
But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. Priests from the sons of Aaron minister to the Lord, and the Levites are in their assigned service.

(2 Chronicles 13:11) 
They offer burnt offerings to the Lord every single day, morning and evening, along with fragrant incense. They also set out the showbread on the purest table, and they light the golden lampstand with its lamps every evening. Indeed, we keep the commands of the Lord our God, Whom you have forsaken.

(2 Chronicles 13:12) 
Therefore, God Himself is the Leader in our army, and His priests sound the trumpets to stir up battle against you. Sons of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers, because it will not go well for you.

(2 Chronicles 13:13) 
But Jeroboam had secretly led an ambush around to attack Judah from the rear. So while one part of his army was positioned in front of Judah's camp, another part was now behind them.

(2 Chronicles 13:14) 
Then Judah looked around, and behold, the battle lines were arrayed against them from both sides! So they cried out to the Lord, and the priests sounded the trumpets.

(2 Chronicles 13:15) 
And all of Judah shouted with a great war cry. And behold, as they were shouting, God Himself struck terror into Jeroboam and all of Israel who had stood against Abijah and Judah.

(2 Chronicles 13:16) 
And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, for God had delivered them into Judah's hand.

(2 Chronicles 13:17) 
So Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter upon Jeroboam, and there fell slain from Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.

(2 Chronicles 13:18) 
And the sons of Israel were humiliated at that time, but the sons of Judah were made strong, because they had relied upon the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 13:19) 
Abijah then pursued Jeroboam and captured his cities: Bethel with its dependent towns, Jeshanah with its dependent towns, and Ephron with its dependent towns.

(2 Chronicles 13:20) 
Jeroboam never regained his strength again during the days of Abijah. Indeed, the Lord struck him down, and he died.

(2 Chronicles 13:21) 
Abijah grew mighty and took fourteen wives for himself. He begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.

(2 Chronicles 13:22) 
Now the rest of Abijah's words, and his ways, and his deeds, are written most diligently in the prophetic book of Iddo the prophet.

(2 Chronicles 14:1) 
King Abijah then died, joining his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. His son Asa became king after him. During Asa's early reign, the land was at peace for ten years.

(2 Chronicles 14:2) 
King Asa then did what was good and morally upright in the sight of the Lord his God.

(2 Chronicles 14:3) 
He removed the altars dedicated to foreign worship and tore down the high places. He shattered the pagan idols and cut down the Asherah poles.

(2 Chronicles 14:4) 
He commanded the people of Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to obey His law and all His commandments.

(2 Chronicles 14:5) 
He also removed the pagan altars and temples from all the cities of Judah. Consequently, his reign was peaceful.

(2 Chronicles 14:6) 
He built fortified cities throughout Judah because the land was quiet, and he endured no times of conflict with anyone rising up against him. This was because the Lord had granted him a period of rest and peace.

(2 Chronicles 14:7) 
Asa then said to the people of Judah: 'Let us build these cities, fortifying them with walls, towers, gates, and bars, so that we may remain at peace from any conflicts. We sought the Lord, and He has granted us peace all around.' So they built them and successfully completed the work.

(2 Chronicles 14:8) 
Asa had an army composed of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. From Benjamin, he had two hundred eighty thousand men who carried shields and were archers. All these were very mighty warriors.

(2 Chronicles 14:9) 
Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of two hundred ninety thousand men and three hundred chariots. He advanced as far as Mareshah.

(2 Chronicles 14:10) 
Asa went out to meet him and arrayed his battle lines in the Valley of Zephathah, which is near Mareshah.

(2 Chronicles 14:11) 
Asa then called out to the Lord his God, saying: 'O Lord, it makes no difference to You whether You help the few or the many. Help us, O Lord our God, for it is in You that we place our hope, and relying solely on Your help, we have come against this vast multitude. O Lord, You are our God; let no mere human prevail against Your power!'

(2 Chronicles 14:12) 
So the Lord struck down the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.

(2 Chronicles 14:13) 
Asa and the army that was with him pursued them as far as Gerar. The Ethiopians were completely devastated, for they had been utterly terrified by the Lord and His army. Asa and his army then carried away a very great amount of plunder.

(2 Chronicles 14:14) 
They then destroyed all the cities surrounding Gerar, striking down every shepherd's encampment, and took much plunder. They also captured an immense number of sheep and camels.

(2 Chronicles 14:15) 
They returned to Jerusalem laden with plunder and also with a sense of awe and reverence, because the Lord had struck terror into all the cities around them.

(2 Chronicles 15:1) 
But the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Azariah, the son of Oded.

(2 Chronicles 15:2) 
Azariah went out to meet King Asa and said to him, 'Listen to me, Asa, and all of Judah and Benjamin! The Lord is with you because you were with Him. If you seek Him, you will surely find Him. But if you abandon Him, then He will abandon you.'

(2 Chronicles 15:3) 
For many years in Israel, the people had lived without the true God, without a teaching priest to guide them, and without the Law.

(2 Chronicles 15:4) 
But in their distress, when they turned back to the Lord, the God of Israel, and truly sought Him, they found Him.

(2 Chronicles 15:5) 
During that time, there was no peace for those who traveled, nor for those who stayed; instead, great terrors afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. City was shattered against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

(2 Chronicles 15:6) 
For the Lord afflicted them with every kind of distress.

(2 Chronicles 15:7) 
Therefore, strengthen yourselves, and do not let your hands grow weak, for there will be a reward for your work.

(2 Chronicles 15:8) 
When King Asa heard these words and the prophecy from Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed all the idols from the entire land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then rededicated the Lord's altar that stood before the portico of the Lord's Temple.

(2 Chronicles 15:9) 
Then King Asa gathered all of Judah and Benjamin, along with the foreigners from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them. Many people from Israel had fled to him because they saw that the Lord his God was with him.

(2 Chronicles 15:10) 
So they all assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.

(2 Chronicles 15:11) 
On that day, from the plunder they had brought back, they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

(2 Chronicles 15:12) 
They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul.

(2 Chronicles 15:13) 
Anyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.

(2 Chronicles 15:14) 
They swore an oath to the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with ram's horns.

(2 Chronicles 15:15) 
All of Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their heart. They had sought Him with their whole desire, and He had been found by them. The Lord then gave them rest on every side.

(2 Chronicles 15:16) 
King Asa also removed his mother, Maacah, from her position as queen mother because she had made an abominable idol for a pagan Asherah pole. Asa cut down her idol, smashed it into pieces, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.

(2 Chronicles 15:17) 
However, the high places where pagan worship occurred were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, Asa's heart remained fully committed to the Lord throughout his entire life.

(2 Chronicles 15:18) 
He brought into the house of the Lord the holy gifts that his father had consecrated, along with his own gifts of silver, gold, and various vessels.

(2 Chronicles 15:19) 
There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.

(2 Chronicles 16:1) 
In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasa, the king of Israel, marched up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from entering or leaving Asa's territory.

(2 Chronicles 16:2) 
So Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and from his own royal treasuries, and sent it to Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, who was living in Damascus, saying:

(2 Chronicles 16:3) 
“Let there be an alliance between me and you, just as there was between my father and your father. Because of this, I have sent you silver and gold so that you will break your alliance with Baasa, the king of Israel, and he will withdraw his troops from my land.”

(2 Chronicles 16:4) 
Ben-Hadad agreed to this, and he sent the commanders of his army against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.

(2 Chronicles 16:5) 
When Baasa heard about this attack, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work there.

(2 Chronicles 16:6) 
Then King Asa gathered all of Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber that Baasa had used to fortify Ramah. With these materials, Asa fortified Geba and Mizpah instead.

(2 Chronicles 16:7) 
At that time, Hanani the prophet came to Asa, the king of Judah, and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Syria and not on the Lord, your God, that is why the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your grasp, and you did not achieve a decisive victory.”

(2 Chronicles 16:8) 
Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a great multitude with many chariots and horsemen? Yet, when you placed your trust in the Lord, He delivered them into your hand.

(2 Chronicles 16:9) 
For the eyes of the Lord constantly survey the entire earth, and He provides strength to those whose hearts are completely devoted to Him. You have acted foolishly in this matter, and because of this, from now on, you will face wars.

(2 Chronicles 16:10) 
Asa became enraged at the prophet and ordered him to be put in prison; indeed, the king was very angry about this prophecy. At the same time, Asa also cruelly oppressed some of the people.

(2 Chronicles 16:11) 
As for the rest of the acts of Asa, from first to last, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

(2 Chronicles 16:12) 
Furthermore, even in his illness, which began in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, when his feet became diseased, he did not seek the Lord in his sickness, but rather put his trust in the skill of physicians.

(2 Chronicles 16:13) 
So Asa rested with his ancestors and died in the forty-first year of his reign.

(2 Chronicles 16:14) 
They buried him in his own tomb, which he had carved out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bed filled with spices and various fragrant perfumes, prepared by the perfumer's art, and they burned a very large funeral pyre in his honor.

(2 Chronicles 17:1) 
And Jehoshaphat, his son, began to reign in his place. He strengthened himself against the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 17:2) 
He placed military garrisons in all the fortified cities of Judah. He also stationed commanders throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of the territory of Ephraim that Asa, his father, had captured.

(2 Chronicles 17:3) 
The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier, faithful ways of David, his ancestor, and he did not persist in worshipping the idols of Baal.

(2 Chronicles 17:4) 
Instead, he sought the God of his father, and diligently followed His commandments, unlike the wicked practices of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 17:5) 
The Lord strengthened the kingdom in his grasp, and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat. He acquired great wealth and renown.

(2 Chronicles 17:6) 
Moreover, because his heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord, he also removed the high places of idolatry and the sacred groves dedicated to false gods from Judah.

(2 Chronicles 17:7) 
In the third year of his reign, he sent some of his officials: Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 17:8) 
With these officials, he sent the Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah. And with them, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.

(2 Chronicles 17:9) 
They taught the law of the Lord throughout Judah, carrying the book of the law with them. They traveled through all the cities of Judah, instructing the people.

(2 Chronicles 17:10) 
Consequently, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands near Judah, so they dared not wage war against Jehoshaphat.

(2 Chronicles 17:11) 
Even the Philistines brought gifts and silver tribute to Jehoshaphat. And the Arabs also brought him livestock: seven thousand seven hundred rams and the same number of goats.

(2 Chronicles 17:12) 
So Jehoshaphat grew more powerful and was greatly exalted. He built fortresses and fortified cities throughout Judah.

(2 Chronicles 17:13) 
He carried out many construction projects in the cities of Judah, and he had mighty warriors stationed in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 17:14) 
This is their enrollment according to their ancestral families: From Judah, the commanders of the army were Adnah the chief, and with him three hundred thousand mighty warriors.

(2 Chronicles 17:15) 
After him, Johanan was the commander, and with him two hundred eighty thousand.

(2 Chronicles 17:16) 
After him, Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who had consecrated himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand mighty warriors.

(2 Chronicles 17:17) 
From Benjamin, the mighty warriors were Eliada the commander, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and shields.

(2 Chronicles 17:18) 
After him, Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand prepared for war.

(2 Chronicles 17:19) 
All these were warriors who served the king. This number does not include those whom he had placed in the fortified cities throughout all of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 17:20) 
Note: The Clementine Vulgate for 2 Chronicles Chapter 17 concludes at verse 19. Therefore, there are no verses 20-40 to translate for this chapter. The narrative continues in Chapter 18.

(2 Chronicles 18:1) 
Jehoshaphat had accumulated much wealth and great honor during his reign, and he formed a family alliance with Ahab, the King of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 18:2) 
Some years later, Jehoshaphat visited Ahab in Samaria. Ahab showed him great hospitality, slaughtering a vast number of sheep and cattle in his honor, and began to entice and ensnare Jehoshaphat and the many people who had come with him into a military alliance.

(2 Chronicles 18:3) 
Ahab, the King of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, "Will you come with me to Ramoth-Gilead to fight?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you, and my people are with your people. We will be with you in this war."

(2 Chronicles 18:4) 
Then Jehoshaphat said to the King of Israel, "Please, let us first inquire of the Lord to hear what He says about this mission."

(2 Chronicles 18:5) 
So the King of Israel gathered four hundred men who claimed to be prophets and asked them, "Should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we refrain?" They all answered, "Go up, and God will give them into the hand of the king."

(2 Chronicles 18:6) 
Jehoshaphat then asked, "Is there not a true prophet of the Lord here, from whom we can inquire directly?"

(2 Chronicles 18:7) 
The King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man by whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat responded, "The king should not speak such a word against God's prophet."

(2 Chronicles 18:8) 
So the King of Israel called one of his officials and commanded, "Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, quickly."

(2 Chronicles 18:9) 
The King of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, were both seated on their respective thrones, dressed in their royal robes, in the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All the false prophets were prophesying before them.

(2 Chronicles 18:10) 
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these horns you will gore the Syrians until you utterly destroy them.'"

(2 Chronicles 18:11) 
All the other prophets also prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and you will prosper; the Lord will give them into the hand of the king."

(2 Chronicles 18:12) 
The messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Behold, the words of all the prophets are unanimously proclaiming good things to the king. Therefore, I beg you, let your word agree with their words, and speak what is good."

(2 Chronicles 18:13) 
Micaiah replied, "As the Lord lives, whatever my God says, that is what I will speak."

(2 Chronicles 18:14) 
So when Micaiah came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we refrain?" Micaiah replied with sarcasm, "Go up and prosper, for they will be delivered into your hand!"

(2 Chronicles 18:15) 
The king said, "I solemnly command you again and again, in the name of the Lord, that you speak nothing to me but the truth."

(2 Chronicles 18:16) 
Then Micaiah said, "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These have no master; let each one return to his own house in peace.'" This was a prophecy of Ahab's death and the scattering of his army.

(2 Chronicles 18:17) 
So the King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only evil?"

(2 Chronicles 18:18) 
Micaiah then added, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord seated on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left."

(2 Chronicles 18:19) 
And the Lord asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab, the King of Israel, so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?' And while some spoke in one manner, and others in another,

(2 Chronicles 18:20) 
a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, 'I will deceive him.' The Lord asked him, 'In what way will you deceive him?'

(2 Chronicles 18:21) 
He replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his false prophets.' The Lord said, 'You will deceive him, and you will prevail. Go out and do as you have said.'"

(2 Chronicles 18:22) 
Micaiah concluded, "Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has decreed evil concerning you."

(2 Chronicles 18:23) 
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you?"

(2 Chronicles 18:24) 
Micaiah replied, "You yourself will see on that day, when you go into a hidden inner chamber to hide yourself."

(2 Chronicles 18:25) 
Then the King of Israel commanded, "Take Micaiah and lead him away to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,

(2 Chronicles 18:26) 
and tell them: 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison, and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.'"

(2 Chronicles 18:27) 
Micaiah declared, "If you return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Hear, all you peoples!"

(2 Chronicles 18:28) 
So the King of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Chronicles 18:29) 
The King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the King of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.

(2 Chronicles 18:30) 
Now the King of Syria had commanded the commanders of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight against anyone, great or small, except against the King of Israel alone."

(2 Chronicles 18:31) 
When the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "This must be the King of Israel." So they surrounded him to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord, and the Lord helped him; God turned them away from him.

(2 Chronicles 18:32) 
For when the commanders of the chariots realized that he was not the King of Israel, they left him.

(2 Chronicles 18:33) 
However, a certain man drew his bow with careful aim and struck the King of Israel between the joints of his armor, between the lung and the stomach. So Ahab said to his charioteer, "Turn your hand and take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."

(2 Chronicles 18:34) 
The battle raged fiercely throughout that day. The King of Israel remained standing in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. At the setting of the sun, he died.

(2 Chronicles 19:1) 
King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his royal residence in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 19:2) 
But Jehu, the prophet, son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to him: 'You offer help to the wicked, and you ally yourself with those who hate the Lord. Therefore, you have truly deserved the Lord's wrath.'

(2 Chronicles 19:3) 
However, good deeds have been found in you, because you have removed the Asherah poles (idolatrous altars) from the land of Judah, and you have prepared your heart to seek the Lord, the God of your ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 19:4) 
So Jehoshaphat remained in Jerusalem. Then he again went out among the people, from Beersheba all the way to the hill country of Ephraim, and he brought them back to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 19:5) 
And he appointed judges in all the fortified cities of Judah, within each individual city.

(2 Chronicles 19:6) 
And he commanded the judges, saying: 'Consider carefully what you do, for you are not exercising judgment for men, but for the Lord; and whatever you judge will redound upon yourselves, meaning you will be held accountable.'

(2 Chronicles 19:7) 
Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and act with caution. For with the Lord our God there is no injustice, nor any partiality for persons, nor a desire for bribes.

(2 Chronicles 19:8) 
Also in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to administer the Lord's justice and judgment for its inhabitants.

(2 Chronicles 19:9) 
And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus you shall act in the fear of the Lord, faithfully and with wholehearted dedication.'

(2 Chronicles 19:10) 
Every case that comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities—whether it is between relatives, or wherever there is a question concerning the divine law, the commandment, the ceremonial practices, or the statutes—you must instruct them so that they do not sin against the Lord. In doing so, wrath will not come upon you and upon your brethren. Therefore, act in this way, and you will not sin.

(2 Chronicles 19:11) 
Moreover, Amariah, your chief priest (or high priest), will preside over all matters pertaining to the Lord's law. Furthermore, Zebadiah, the son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, will oversee those matters pertaining to the king's duty. You also have the Levites before you to assist. Be strong and act diligently, and the Lord will be with the good (those who do what is right).

(2 Chronicles 20:1) 
After these events, the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon came, and with them people from Midian, to make war against King Jehoshaphat.

(2 Chronicles 20:2) 
Then messengers came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying: “A great multitude of enemies is coming against you from the lands across the Dead Sea, from Syria, and they are now advancing and are already at Engedi.”

(2 Chronicles 20:3) 
But Jehoshaphat was struck with terror by this news, and he gave his whole attention to praying to the Lord; he also proclaimed a fast throughout all of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 20:4) 
So the people of Judah gathered together to pray to the Lord, and people from all the cities of Judah came to ask for His help.

(2 Chronicles 20:5) 
Then King Jehoshaphat stood in the middle of the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the House of the Lord, before the new court,

(2 Chronicles 20:6) 
and he said: “O Lord, God of our fathers, You are God in the heavens, and You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In Your hand are strength and power, and no one can resist You.

(2 Chronicles 20:7) 
Did You not, O our God, drive out all the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham, Your friend?

(2 Chronicles 20:8) 
And they lived in it and built a sanctuary there for Your Name, saying:

(2 Chronicles 20:9) 
‘If evil assails us, whether sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine, we will stand before You in this House, where Your Name has been invoked. We will cry out to You in our tribulations, and You will hear us and save us.’

(2 Chronicles 20:10) 
Now behold, the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir—those through whom You did not allow Israel to pass when they came out of Egypt (but they turned away from them and did not destroy them)—

(2 Chronicles 20:11) 
Behold, they are now acting against us and are striving to drive us out of Your possession, which You have given to us.

(2 Chronicles 20:12) 
O our God, will You not judge them? Truly, in us there is not enough strength to resist this great multitude that is rushing upon us. And since we do not know what we should do, this alone remains for us: to direct our eyes to You for help.”

(2 Chronicles 20:13) 
Indeed, all of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

(2 Chronicles 20:14) 
Therefore, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the multitude.

(2 Chronicles 20:15) 
And he said: “Listen, all of Judah, and you who dwell in Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: ‘Do not fear, nor be dismayed by this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s.

(2 Chronicles 20:16) 
Tomorrow you will go down against them. For they are coming up by the ascent named Sis, and you will find them at the end of the valley, which is beyond the wilderness of Jeruel.

(2 Chronicles 20:17) 
You will not be the ones to fight. Only stand confidently and you will see the Lord’s help with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.’”

(2 Chronicles 20:18) 
Then Jehoshaphat, and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell prostrate on the ground and worshipped the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 20:19) 
Moreover, the Levites from the sons of the Kohathites and from the sons of Korah rose up to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud and high voice.

(2 Chronicles 20:20) 
And when they rose early in the morning, they went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they departed, Jehoshaphat stood and said: “Hear me, Judah, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be safe. Believe His prophets, and all things will happen prosperously for you.”

(2 Chronicles 20:21) 
And after he took counsel with the people, he appointed singers for the Lord to praise Him in holy vestments. They went out before the army, saying: “Give praise to the Lord, for His mercy endures forever!”

(2 Chronicles 20:22) 
And as they began to sing praises and rejoice, the Lord set ambushes for the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come out to fight against Judah, and they were defeated.

(2 Chronicles 20:23) 
For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to kill and utterly destroy them. And when they had finished this work, they also destroyed one another in mutual slaughter.

(2 Chronicles 20:24) 
When the people of Judah came to the watchtower that looks out over the wilderness, they looked from afar and saw the entire region covered with dead bodies, and no one was left alive who could flee.

(2 Chronicles 20:25) 
So Jehoshaphat and all the people with him came to plunder the spoils of the dead. And among the bodies they found clothing, and vessels, and excellent furnishings, and rings, and bracelets, and various ornaments, in such great quantity that they could not carry everything. They spent three days collecting the spoils because of the immense size of the plunder.

(2 Chronicles 20:26) 
On the fourth day, they gathered in the Valley of Beracah (which means 'blessing'), for there they blessed the Lord. And for this reason, it was called the Valley of Blessing even to this present day.

(2 Chronicles 20:27) 
Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Jehoshaphat leading them, back to Jerusalem with great joy, because the Lord had given them joy over their enemies.

(2 Chronicles 20:28) 
And they entered Jerusalem, into the House of the Lord, with psalters, and harps, and trumpets.

(2 Chronicles 20:29) 
Therefore, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 20:30) 
So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had rest, and his God gave him peace on all sides.

(2 Chronicles 20:31) 
Thus, Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.

(2 Chronicles 20:32) 
And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn from it, doing what was good in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 20:33) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places for idol worship, and the heart of the people was not yet fully devoted to the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 20:34) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the books of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the books of the kings of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 20:35) 
After these things, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, allied himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel, whose deeds were very impious.

(2 Chronicles 20:36) 
And he made an agreement with him to build ships that would go to Tarshish; so they built a fleet in Ezion-Geber.

(2 Chronicles 20:37) 
But Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah, appeared prophesying against Jehoshaphat, saying: “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the Lord has struck down your works and destroyed your ships; so they could not go to Tarshish.”

(2 Chronicles 20:38) 
Therefore, Jehoshaphat died and slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. Then Jehoram, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 20:39) 
This verse is a duplicate of verse 34 and confirms the record of Jehoshaphat’s deeds, both early and late, written in the books of Jehu, son of Hanani, which are included in the books of the kings of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 20:40) 
This verse is a duplicate of verse 31 and re-emphasizes that Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.

(2 Chronicles 21:1) 
Josaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Joram then reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 21:2) 
Joram also had brothers, who were all sons of Josaphat. Their names were Azarias, Jahiel, Zacharias, Azarias, Michael, and Saphatias. All of them were sons of Josaphat, the king of Juda.

(2 Chronicles 21:3) 
Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable furnishings. He had also given them fortified cities throughout Juda. But he gave the kingship to Joram, because Joram was his firstborn son.

(2 Chronicles 21:4) 
Therefore, Joram took control of his father's kingdom. Once he had consolidated his power, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and all the leading men of Juda as well.

(2 Chronicles 21:5) 
Joram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 21:6) 
He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Achab had done, for his wife was the daughter of Achab. And he committed evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 21:7) 
However, the Lord was unwilling to destroy the house of David because of the covenant He had made with David, and because He had promised to provide a 'lamp'—meaning a continuous line of descendants—for David and his sons for all time.

(2 Chronicles 21:8) 
In those days, Edom rebelled to break free from the dominion of Juda, and they established their own king.

(2 Chronicles 21:9) 
Because of this, Joram set out with his commanders and all the cavalry he possessed. He and his forces rose up by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded them, striking down all the commanders of their cavalry.

(2 Chronicles 21:10) 
Nevertheless, Edom secured its freedom, and has not been subject to Juda down to the present day. At that same time, Libnah also revolted so that it would no longer be under his control, because Joram had abandoned the Lord, the God of his ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 21:11) 
Furthermore, he built high places for idol worship in the cities of Juda, and he led the inhabitants of Jerusalem to spiritual adultery by compelling them to worship idols.

(2 Chronicles 21:12) 
Then a letter came to him from Elias the prophet, which said: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa, the king of Juda,'

(2 Chronicles 21:13) 
'but instead have imitated the kings of Israel and have led Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into spiritual adultery, just as the house of Achab did; and furthermore, you have murdered your own brothers, members of your father’s house, men who were better than you:'

(2 Chronicles 21:14) 
'behold, the Lord will strike you with a mighty plague—and your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions.'

(2 Chronicles 21:15) 
'You yourself will be struck down by a terrible and severe illness of your intestines, until, day by day, your intestines slowly come out of your body.'

(2 Chronicles 21:16) 
Therefore, the Lord stirred up the spirit of hostility against Joram among the Philistines and the Arabs, who dwell near the Ethiopians.

(2 Chronicles 21:17) 
They invaded the land of Juda and plundered it. They carried away all the wealth found in the king's palace, along with his sons and his wives. No son was left to him, except Joachaz, who was his youngest.

(2 Chronicles 21:18) 
After all these things, the Lord struck him with an incurable disease in his intestines.

(2 Chronicles 21:19) 
As days succeeded days, and the passage of time continued, the full cycle of two years was completed. And thus, consumed by a long, wasting sickness, he gave up his spirit. He died from a most terrible illness. And the people did not make a ceremonial burning for him, as was customary for his ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 21:20) 
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. He did not walk in righteousness. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.

(2 Chronicles 22:1) 
The people of Jerusalem chose Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, to be the new king in his father’s place. This was because the bandits who had raided the camp along with the Arabians had already killed all of Jehoram's older sons. So Ahaziah, the son of King Jehoram of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Chronicles 22:2) 
Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for only one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, who was the daughter of Omri.

(2 Chronicles 22:3) 
But Ahaziah himself walked in the sinful ways of the house of Ahab, because his mother encouraged him to behave in an unholy manner.

(2 Chronicles 22:4) 
So he committed evil in the presence of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab had done. Indeed, after his father’s death, Ahab’s family became his counselors, leading him to his own ruin.

(2 Chronicles 22:5) 
He followed their sinful advice and went with Jehoram, the son of Ahab, who was the king of Israel, to fight against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead. There, the Syrians wounded Jehoram.

(2 Chronicles 22:6) 
Jehoram returned to Jezreel to recover from the many wounds he had received in that battle. Ahaziah, the son of King Jehoram of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Jehoram, son of Ahab, while he was ill.

(2 Chronicles 22:7) 
It was, in fact, according to God's plan that Ahaziah came to visit Jehoram. After his visit, Ahaziah went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to utterly destroy the house of Ahab.

(2 Chronicles 22:8) 
So when Jehu was annihilating the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah. Jehu then killed all of them.

(2 Chronicles 22:9) 
Jehu pursued Ahaziah and found him hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu, who then killed him. They buried Ahaziah because he was the son of Jehoshaphat, who had truly sought the Lord with all his heart. After this, there was no longer any hope that anyone from Ahaziah’s royal line would be able to reign.

(2 Chronicles 22:10) 
When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was dead, she took action. She rose up and mercilessly killed everyone from the royal line of the house of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 22:11) 
Nevertheless, Jehoshabeath, a daughter of the king, took Joash, Ahaziah’s son, and secretly removed him from among the other royal sons who were being killed. She then placed Joash and his nurse in a bedroom to hide them. Jehoshabeath, who was King Jehoram’s daughter, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, and Ahaziah’s own sister, concealed Joash from Athaliah so that he would not be killed.

(2 Chronicles 22:12) 
Joash remained hidden with Jehoshabeath in the Lord’s house for six years. During this time, Athaliah continued to reign over the land.

(2 Chronicles 23:1) 
Later on, in the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered his strength and summoned the captains: namely, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. And he entered into a solemn covenant with them.

(2 Chronicles 23:2) 
And they went throughout Judah, gathering the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the Israelite families, and they all came to Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 23:3) 
And after they had made this covenant, the entire assembly, gathered with the young King Joash in the House of the Lord, heard Jehoiada say to them: 'Behold, the king’s rightful son shall reign, just as the Lord has promised concerning the descendants of David.'

(2 Chronicles 23:4) 
Therefore, this is the plan you shall carry out: A third of you, those who are priests and Levites and gatekeepers, who come in for service on the Sabbath, shall be stationed at the temple gates.

(2 Chronicles 23:5) 
And another third shall be stationed at the king's palace, and the final third at the gate called the Foundation Gate. All the rest of the people, however, shall remain in the courtyards of the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 23:6) 
And no one else shall enter the House of the Lord, except the priests and those Levites who are actively ministering. Only they may enter, because they have been set apart for holy service. All the rest of the people, however, shall observe the Lord's commands by remaining in the outer courts.

(2 Chronicles 23:7) 
And you shall surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hands. If anyone else attempts to enter the inner courts of the temple, let him be put to death. You are to remain with the king, both when he enters and when he leaves.

(2 Chronicles 23:8) 
So the Levites and all of Judah carried out everything that Jehoiada the high priest had commanded. Each man took his designated soldiers—those who were coming on duty for the Sabbath, and those who were going off duty from the Sabbath—for Jehoiada did not dismiss any of the regular priestly divisions.

(2 Chronicles 23:9) 
Jehoiada then gave the captains King David’s spears, large shields, and small shields, which had been consecrated — dedicated to God’s service — and stored in the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 23:10) 
Then he stationed all the people, each girded with a sword, in a line extending from the right side of the temple to the left side of the altar and the temple, encircling the king.

(2 Chronicles 23:11) 
Then they brought out the king's son, Joash, and placed the royal crown upon his head, along with the scroll of the Law, which served as the royal insignia. They then proclaimed him king. Jehoiada and his sons also anointed him with oil, and everyone applauded and shouted, 'Long live the king!'

(2 Chronicles 23:12) 
But Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king. So she went in among the people, into the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 23:13) 
She saw the young king standing on the platform at the entrance to the temple, with the captains and trumpets all around him. All the people of the land were rejoicing, blowing trumpets, singing praises, and playing various musical instruments. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, 'Treason! Treason!'

(2 Chronicles 23:14) 
Then Jehoiada the high priest commanded the captains of the army, saying to them: 'Lead her out beyond the temple enclosure, and let her be put to death there, by the sword.'

(2 Chronicles 23:15) 
For the high priest had given orders that she should not be killed within the sacred confines of the House of the Lord. So they cleared a path for her, and as she left by the Horse Gate, near the path to the king’s palace, they put her to death.

(2 Chronicles 23:16) 
Jehoiada then made a new covenant with all the people and with King Joash, ensuring that they would indeed be the Lord's own people once again.

(2 Chronicles 23:17) 
And all the people then went to the temple of Baal and completely destroyed it. They smashed its altars and idols into pieces. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, right there before his altars.

(2 Chronicles 23:18) 
Jehoiada also appointed supervisors in the House of the Lord, under the authority of the priests and Levites, whom King David had originally assigned to their duties there. Their role was to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with joy and songs, according to the musical arrangements established by David.

(2 Chronicles 23:19) 
He also appointed gatekeepers at the entrances to the House of the Lord, to ensure that no one ritually unclean would be permitted to enter.

(2 Chronicles 23:20) 
Jehoiada also assembled the captains, the mighty warriors, the leaders of the people, and all the common folk of the land. They then escorted the king from the House of the Lord and brought him through the Upper Gate into the royal palace, where they seated him securely upon the royal throne.

(2 Chronicles 23:21) 
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city settled into peace, now that Athaliah had been put to death by the sword.

(2 Chronicles 24:1) 
Joash was seven years old when he began his reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem, the city of peace. His mother’s name was Sebia, from the city of Beersheba.

(2 Chronicles 24:2) 
And he did what was pleasing and right before the Lord God for as long as Jehoiada the priest lived.

(2 Chronicles 24:3) 
Jehoiada took two wives for King Joash, and from them, Joash begot sons and daughters.

(2 Chronicles 24:4) 
After these events, Joash began to consider how to restore the Temple of the Lord God.

(2 Chronicles 24:5) 
So King Joash gathered the priests and Levites and told them: "Go throughout the cities of Judah and collect money from all the people of Israel. This money is to repair the Temple of your God each year. Make haste and complete this task." However, the Levites completely neglected their duty.

(2 Chronicles 24:6) 
Then the king summoned Jehoiada, the high priest, and said to him: "Why have you failed to compel the Levites to collect the money that was brought from Judah and Jerusalem for the Temple, which houses the Ark of the Covenant?"

(2 Chronicles 24:7) 
For Athaliah, who was a wicked woman, along with her sons, had destroyed the Temple of God. They had even taken all the sacred vessels and consecrated articles from the Lord's Temple and used them to worship the false gods, Baalim.

(2 Chronicles 24:8) 
Therefore, the king gave a command, and they made a chest. They placed this chest outside, next to the entrance gate of the Lord's Temple.

(2 Chronicles 24:9) 
And it was proclaimed throughout Judah and Jerusalem that everyone should bring to the Lord the temple tax, which Moses, the servant of God, had levied upon all Israel in the wilderness.

(2 Chronicles 24:10) 
And all the princes and all the people rejoiced. They offered gifts and put them into the chest of the Lord until it was filled.

(2 Chronicles 24:11) 
And whenever it was time for the Levites' officials to bring the chest before the king (for they saw that much money had been collected), the king’s scribe would come, along with the official appointed by the chief priest. They would empty the money that was in the chest, and then return the chest to its proper place. They did this regularly, day after day, and a large sum of money was gathered.

(2 Chronicles 24:12) 
The king and Jehoiada then gave this money to those who were in charge of the work on the Lord's Temple. These overseers used the money to hire masons and carpenters to restore the Temple. They also hired ironworkers and bronzesmiths to repair whatever had fallen into ruin.

(2 Chronicles 24:13) 
And those who were in charge of the work did so. The damage to the structure was covered over, and they restored the Temple of the Lord to its proper state and made it strong.

(2 Chronicles 24:14) 
When the work on the Temple was completed, they brought the remaining money before the king and Jehoiada. From this money, they made vessels for use in the Lord’s Temple: tables, bowls, small mortars, and other vessels of gold and silver. And throughout all the days that Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were continually offered in the Lord’s Temple.

(2 Chronicles 24:15) 
Therefore, Jehoiada grew old and lived a long life, full of days. He died when he was one hundred and thirty years old.

(2 Chronicles 24:16) 
They buried him in the City of David, among the kings, because he had done much good for Israel, both for the nation and for the household of God.

(2 Chronicles 24:17) 
But after Jehoiada died, the princes of Judah approached King Joash and bowed down before him, showing him homage. The king, swayed by their entreaties, agreed to their requests.

(2 Chronicles 24:18) 
And so, they abandoned the Temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and instead served sacred groves and carved idols. Because of this grievous sin, great wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 24:19) 
God continually sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord, but even with their solemn warnings, the people refused to listen to anything.

(2 Chronicles 24:20) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and declared to them: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Why do you transgress the commandment of the Lord? This will bring you no good. You have forsaken the Lord, and therefore He has forsaken you.'"

(2 Chronicles 24:21) 
But the people conspired against him and, at the king's command, stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord's Temple.

(2 Chronicles 24:22) 
King Joash did not remember the great kindness that Jehoiada, his father and mentor, had shown him, but instead had Jehoiada's son killed. As Zechariah lay dying, he cried out: "May the Lord see this injustice, and may He hold you accountable!"

(2 Chronicles 24:23) 
And when a year had passed, the army of Syria marched against King Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, killing all the leaders of the people and sending all the plunder they had taken back to the king in Damascus.

(2 Chronicles 24:24) 
Indeed, even though the Syrian army came with only a small number of soldiers, the Lord delivered a vast multitude of Judah's people into their hands. This was because Judah had abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors. And upon King Joash himself, a very severe judgment was executed.

(2 Chronicles 24:25) 
When the Syrians withdrew, they left Joash afflicted with many painful diseases. Then his own servants rose up against him to avenge the shedding of the blood of Jehoiada the priest's son. They murdered him on his own bed, and so he died. They buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the royal tombs alongside the other kings.

(2 Chronicles 24:26) 
Those who conspired against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabitess.

(2 Chronicles 24:27) 
Furthermore, the details of his sons, the amount of money that had been collected during his reign, and the full account of the restoration of the Temple of God are all diligently recorded in the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah succeeded him as king.

(2 Chronicles 25:1) 
Amasias was twenty-five years old when he began his reign. He reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 25:2) 
He did what was good in the sight of the Lord, but his heart was not fully committed to God; his faithfulness was flawed.

(2 Chronicles 25:3) 
When his reign was firmly established, he executed the servants who had murdered King Joas, his father.

(2 Chronicles 25:4) 
However, he did not put their children to death. This was in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the Lord had commanded, saying: "Parents shall not die for their children, nor children for their parents, but each person shall die for their own sin."

(2 Chronicles 25:5) 
Amasias also gathered Judah and appointed military commanders for them, according to their families, placing tribunes and centurions throughout all Judah and Benjamin. He counted all men twenty years and older and found thirty thousand young men who were able to go out to battle and were skilled with weapons.

(2 Chronicles 25:6) 
He also hired one hundred thousand strong warriors from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. This was a mercenary army.

(2 Chronicles 25:7) 
But a man of God, a prophet, came to him and said: "O King, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel, nor with all the sons of Ephraim." The Lord had rejected their alliance.

(2 Chronicles 25:8) 
"If you think that your army will be strengthened by these mercenaries, then act boldly and be strong in battle. But the Lord will still cause you to be defeated before your enemies, because it is God who can both help and cause flight."

(2 Chronicles 25:9) 
Amasias then said to the man of God: "What shall then become of the hundred talents of silver that I have given to the soldiers of Israel?" To which the man of God answered: "The Lord has the means to give you much more than this."

(2 Chronicles 25:10) 
So Amasias separated the army that had come to him from Ephraim, sending them back to their own region. But they were extremely angry at Judah and returned to their own lands, full of rage.

(2 Chronicles 25:11) 
Amasias, strengthened by God's counsel, led his people out and went to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down ten thousand of the sons of Seir, the Idumeans.

(2 Chronicles 25:12) 
And the sons of Judah captured ten thousand others alive. They brought them to the top of a certain craggy rock and threw them down from it, so that all of them were broken into pieces. This was a brutal act of war.

(2 Chronicles 25:13) 
Meanwhile, the mercenary army that Amasias had sent back, refusing to let them go with him to battle, spread themselves over the cities of Judah, from Samaria all the way to Bethoron. They killed three thousand people and plundered a great deal of spoil.

(2 Chronicles 25:14) 
After Amasias returned from the slaughter of the Idumeans, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, the defeated people, and set them up as his own gods. He worshipped these false gods and offered libations to them.

(2 Chronicles 25:15) 
And the Lord was angry against Amasias. He sent a prophet to him, who said: "Why have you sought the gods of these foreign peoples, who could not even deliver their own people from your hand, let alone help you?"

(2 Chronicles 25:16) 
As the prophet spoke these words, Amasias answered him: "Are you the king's counselor? Be silent, lest I have you killed!" So the prophet stopped, but he added: "I know that the Lord has decided to destroy you, because you have done this evil by worshipping idols and have no longer listened to my word."

(2 Chronicles 25:17) 
Therefore, Amasias, king of Judah, after taking counsel with his officials, sent messengers to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us meet face to face in battle."

(2 Chronicles 25:18) 
Joas sent messengers in return, saying: "The thistle of Lebanon sent to the cedar of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But then the wild beasts of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle." This was a parable, mocking Amasias.

(2 Chronicles 25:19) 
"You have said: 'I have indeed defeated Idumea,' and because of this, your heart is lifted up in pride. Stay in your own home! Why do you provoke evil, that you should fall, you and Judah with you?" This was a direct warning against Amasias's arrogance.

(2 Chronicles 25:20) 
But Amasias would not listen, because it was God's plan and judgment that he should be handed over into the hands of his enemies, because of his worship of the gods of Idumea.

(2 Chronicles 25:21) 
So Joas, king of Israel, went up against Judah. And they met face to face, he and Amasias, king of Judah, at Bethsames, which is in Judah.

(2 Chronicles 25:22) 
And Judah was defeated before Israel. Every man fled to his own tent, abandoning their king.

(2 Chronicles 25:23) 
Furthermore, Joas, king of Israel, captured Amasias, king of Judah, the son of Joas, son of Joachaz, at Bethsames. He brought him to Jerusalem and then broke down the walls of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate all the way to the Corner Gate.

(2 Chronicles 25:24) 
He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, the sons of the nobles, and brought them back to Samaria.

(2 Chronicles 25:25) 
Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 25:26) 
The rest of the acts of Amasias, both his early deeds and his later ones, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

(2 Chronicles 25:27) 
However, after Amasias turned away from following the Lord, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachis. They sent men after him to Lachis and murdered him there.

(2 Chronicles 25:28) 
And they brought him back on horses and buried him in the city of David, Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 26:1) 
Therefore, all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.

(2 Chronicles 26:2) 
He built Ailath and restored it for Judah, after King Amaziah had died and been buried with his ancestors.

(2 Chronicles 26:3) 
Azariah was sixteen years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechelia, and she was from Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 26:4) 
He did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.

(2 Chronicles 26:5) 
He sought the Lord's guidance during the time of Zechariah the prophet, who taught him to fear the Lord. And as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper in all his endeavors.

(2 Chronicles 26:6) 
It was he who waged war against the Philistines and tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He also built new towns in the region of Ashdod and throughout the land of the Philistines.

(2 Chronicles 26:7) 
And God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Ammonites.

(2 Chronicles 26:8) 
The Ammonites brought gifts and tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread even to the border of Egypt, because of his many victories and his growing power.

(2 Chronicles 26:9) 
Uzziah also built defensive towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and fortified them strongly.

(2 Chronicles 26:10) 
He also built watchtowers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns for water, because he had large flocks and herds. He employed farmers in the plains and lowlands for his fields and vineyards, and vine-growers in the hill country and on Mount Carmel, for he was a great lover of agriculture.

(2 Chronicles 26:11) 
Uzziah also maintained a strong army of trained soldiers, numbering three hundred and seven thousand five hundred men, who were always ready for battle.

(2 Chronicles 26:12) 
All of these were under the command of two thousand six hundred valiant officers, each leading units from their own family clans.

(2 Chronicles 26:13) 
And under the command of these officers was the main army of fighters, totaling three hundred and seven thousand five hundred soldiers, who fought for the king against his enemies.

(2 Chronicles 26:14) 
Uzziah also equipped his entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows and arrows, and slings for casting stones.

(2 Chronicles 26:15) 
In Jerusalem, he invented and built various types of ingenious war machines to be placed on the towers and at the corners of the walls. These machines could shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide because he was miraculously helped by God until he became powerful.

(2 Chronicles 26:16) 
But when he had become strong, his heart became proud, leading to his ruin. He then disregarded the Lord his God and entered the Lord’s Temple to burn incense on the altar of incense, which was forbidden to him.

(2 Chronicles 26:17) 
Then Azariah the high priest boldly went in after him, followed by eighty courageous priests of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 26:18) 
They confronted Uzziah and said to him: “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord! That is the duty of the priests alone—the descendants of Aaron—who have been consecrated for this sacred ministry. Leave the sanctuary at once! Do not defy God's command! For this act will bring you no honor from the Lord God, but rather His judgment.”

(2 Chronicles 26:19) 
Uzziah, still holding the censer in his hand, became furious with the priests, intending to burn the incense regardless. But at that very moment, leprosy broke out on his forehead right there in the presence of the priests, inside the Lord's Temple, beside the altar of incense.

(2 Chronicles 26:20) 
When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests turned to look at him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead and immediately rushed him out of the Temple. He himself also hurried out, for he knew that the Lord had afflicted him with the disease.

(2 Chronicles 26:21) 
King Uzziah remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, isolated because of his leprosy. Because of this, he was also barred from entering the Lord's Temple. Meanwhile, his son Jotham took charge of the royal palace, governing the people of the land.

(2 Chronicles 26:22) 
The rest of the events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.

(2 Chronicles 26:23) 
Uzziah died and was buried with his ancestors, but they buried him in a royal field, not in the royal tombs, because he had been a leper. And his son Jotham reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 27:1) 
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began his reign as king, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.

(2 Chronicles 27:2) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done in all things, except that he did not enter the Temple of the Lord—a transgression his father had made—and the people still continued to sin against God.

(2 Chronicles 27:3) 
It was Jotham who built the upper gate of the Temple of the Lord, and he also constructed much on the wall of Ophel, a fortified section of Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 27:4) 
He built cities in the mountains of Judah, and he also constructed fortresses and towers in the forests.

(2 Chronicles 27:5) 
He himself fought against the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. In that time, the Ammonites paid him one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand kors of barley as tribute.

(2 Chronicles 27:6) 
The Ammonites continued to pay these same amounts to King Jotham in the second year and the third year of his reign.

(2 Chronicles 27:7) 
Jotham grew strong in his reign, because he had directed his ways steadfastly before the Lord his God.

(2 Chronicles 27:8) 
The rest of the acts of Jotham—including all his wars and his other deeds—are written in the book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

(2 Chronicles 27:9) 
Jotham was forty-one years old when he began his reign, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He slept with his fathers—that is, he died—and they buried him in the City of David. His son Ahaz then reigned as king in his place.

(2 Chronicles 28:1) 
Ahaz was twelve years old when he began to reign. He reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike David his forefather.

(2 Chronicles 28:2) 
Instead, he walked in the wicked ways of the kings of Israel, even casting molten idols for the false gods known as Baalim.

(2 Chronicles 28:3) 
For he himself burned incense in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. He even burned his own sons alive in fire, following the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before the sons of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 28:4) 
He also offered sacrifices and burned incense on the pagan high places, on the hills, and under every leafy tree—places dedicated to idolatry.

(2 Chronicles 28:5) 
Therefore, the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him down and carried away a great number of captives from Judah to Damascus. The Lord also delivered Ahaz—the king of Judah—into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted a great slaughter upon Judah.

(2 Chronicles 28:6) 
Azarias, son of Remaliah—the king of Israel—killed one hundred and twenty thousand men from Judah in a single day. All of them were mighty warriors, and this happened because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their forefathers.

(2 Chronicles 28:7) 
At that same time, Zichri, a powerful warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the chief officer of the royal palace, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king.

(2 Chronicles 28:8) 
The sons of Israel also took captive from their brethren in Judah two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls. They also took a vast amount of plunder and brought it all to Samaria.

(2 Chronicles 28:9) 
Now there was a prophet of the Lord there, whose name was Oded. He went out to meet the army returning to Samaria and said to them: 'Listen! The Lord God of your forefathers was indeed angry with Judah and delivered them into your hands. But you have killed them with such cruel savagery that your cruelty has reached up to heaven itself, provoking divine wrath!'

(2 Chronicles 28:10) 
Furthermore, you now intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem to yourselves as male and female slaves. This is absolutely not right for you to do! Have you yourselves not also sinned against the Lord your God?

(2 Chronicles 28:11) 
Now, therefore, listen to my advice: return the captives whom you have taken from your brethren. Otherwise, the fierce wrath of the Lord will surely return upon you.

(2 Chronicles 28:12) 
Then, certain men from among the chiefs of Ephraim—namely Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood up to confront those who were returning from the war.

(2 Chronicles 28:13) 
And they said to them: 'Do not bring the captives here, lest we add to our sin against the Lord! Do you wish to pile even more onto our already existing sins and ancient offenses? Indeed, our sin is already great, and the fierce wrath of the Lord is already upon Israel!'

(2 Chronicles 28:14) 
So the army released the captives and all the plunder in the presence of the princes and the entire assembly of people.

(2 Chronicles 28:15) 
Then the men whom we mentioned previously stepped forward. They took the captives, and all those who were naked, and clothed them with garments from the plunder. After they had clothed, shod, refreshed them with food and drink, and anointed them with oil, they then transported them by chariots to their brethren in Jericho, the City of Palms. Afterward, these men returned to Samaria.

(2 Chronicles 28:16) 
At that same time, King Ahaz sent an urgent plea to the king of Assyria, requesting military assistance.

(2 Chronicles 28:17) 
For the Edomites had also invaded Judah, struck down many people, and carried away much plunder.

(2 Chronicles 28:18) 
The Philistines also spread throughout the lowland cities and the southern region of Judah. They captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo, along with their surrounding villages, and then settled there.

(2 Chronicles 28:19) 
For the Lord had brought Judah low because of Ahaz, the king of Judah. This was because Ahaz had stripped Judah of divine help and had contemptuously rebelled against the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 28:20) 
Then Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, came against Ahaz. He not only afflicted Ahaz but also utterly devastated the land of Judah without any resistance.

(2 Chronicles 28:21) 
Ahaz, indeed, stripped the house of the Lord, as well as the royal palace and the houses of the princes, and gave these treasures as gifts to the king of Assyria. Yet, despite all this, it brought him no benefit.

(2 Chronicles 28:22) 
Moreover, even in the very time of his distress and suffering, King Ahaz only increased the sins he had previously committed against the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 28:23) 
Then Ahaz sacrificed victims to the gods of Damascus, claiming that these were the gods who had defeated him. And he said, 'The gods of the kings of Syria help them in battle, so I will worship them, and perhaps they will give me help.' Yet, on the contrary, these very gods became the ruin of Ahaz and of all Israel.

(2 Chronicles 28:24) 
So Ahaz gathered all the sacred vessels from the house of God and cut them into pieces. He then shut the doors of the house of the Lord and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 28:25) 
Furthermore, in all the cities of Judah, he built high places for burning incense to pagan deities. In doing so, he provoked the Lord, the God of his forefathers, to great anger.

(2 Chronicles 28:26) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Ahaz, and all his works, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

(2 Chronicles 28:27) 
So Ahaz slept with his forefathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem. However, they did not place him in the royal tombs of the kings of Israel—meaning the ancestral burial grounds of Judah's kings—because of his wickedness. And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 29:1) 
Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king. He reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

(2 Chronicles 29:2) 
And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as David his father had done.

(2 Chronicles 29:3) 
In the first year of his reign, in the very first month, he opened the doors of the House of the Lord and restored them.

(2 Chronicles 29:4) 
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, gathering them together in the eastern square.

(2 Chronicles 29:5) 
And he said to them, 'Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves and purify the House of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and remove all defilement from the sanctuary'.

(2 Chronicles 29:6) 
For our fathers have sinned greatly and done evil in the sight of the Lord our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the Lord, and turned their backs to it.

(2 Chronicles 29:7) 
They also shut the doors of the portico, extinguished the lamps, did not burn incense, and did not offer burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 29:8) 
Therefore, the Lord's wrath was kindled against Judah and Jerusalem, and He delivered them into turmoil, into astonishment, and into a curse that makes people hiss in contempt, just as you yourselves see with your own eyes.

(2 Chronicles 29:9) 
Behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives have been led away captive because of this.

(2 Chronicles 29:10) 
Now, therefore, it is my firm intention to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that the fierce anger of His wrath may turn away from us.

(2 Chronicles 29:11) 
My sons, do not be negligent! The Lord has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, to serve Him, and to burn incense.

(2 Chronicles 29:12) 
So the Levites rose up: Maath, son of Amasai, and Joel, son of Azariah, from the sons of Kohath. From the sons of Merari, Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehalelel. And from the sons of Gershon, Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah.

(2 Chronicles 29:13) 
From the sons of Elizaphan: Nechahi and Oziel. And from the sons of Asaph: Samri and Jeiel.

(2 Chronicles 29:14) 
From the sons of Heman: Zechariah and Mattaniah. From the sons of Jeduthun: Jehiel and Shimei.

(2 Chronicles 29:15) 
After gathering their brethren and sanctifying themselves, they went in, according to the king's command and the Lord's precept, to purify the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:16) 
The priests then entered the Lord's Temple to purify it and brought out all the defilement they found there into the vestibule of the Lord's House. After that, they went out with the Levites and carried it outside to the Kidron Valley.

(2 Chronicles 29:17) 
They began to sanctify the Temple on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day of that month, they entered the portico of the Temple. They purified the Temple itself for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of that same month, they completed the purification of the Lord's House.

(2 Chronicles 29:18) 
They also went in to King Hezekiah, saying, 'We have purified all the sacred parts of the Lord's House, the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, as well as the table of the bread of the Presence with all its vessels'.

(2 Chronicles 29:19) 
And all the vessels that King Ahaz, during his reign, had polluted when he scorned the law of the Lord—all these we have purified and sanctified, and they are now before the altar of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:20) 
Then King Hezekiah rose early in the morning and, gathering all the leaders of the city, went up to the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:21) 
And he offered seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He also commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:22) 
So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and poured it upon the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and also poured that blood upon the altar. And they sacrificed the lambs and, in the same way, poured their blood upon the altar.

(2 Chronicles 29:23) 
They brought the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the entire assembly, who laid their hands upon them.

(2 Chronicles 29:24) 
Then the priests laid their hands upon them and sprinkled their blood on the altar for the atonement of all Israel; for the king had commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 29:25) 
He also stationed the Levites in the House of the Lord with cymbals, psalteries, and lyres, according to the ordinance of King David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet—for it was the Lord's command given through His prophets.

(2 Chronicles 29:26) 
So the Levites stood with the musical instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

(2 Chronicles 29:27) 
And Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began simultaneously, along with the trumpets and the various instruments that had been made under King David's direction, by the hands of the Levite ministers.

(2 Chronicles 29:28) 
And the entire assembly worshipped, with the singers and trumpets sounding in unison, until the burnt offering was completed.

(2 Chronicles 29:29) 
And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were with him bowed down and worshipped.

(2 Chronicles 29:30) 
Then King Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph, the king's seer. And they praised Him with great joy, bowing their heads in worship.

(2 Chronicles 29:31) 
And Hezekiah spoke further, saying, 'Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, approach and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the House of the Lord.' So the entire assembly brought sacrifices, thank offerings, and burnt offerings with a devout heart.

(2 Chronicles 29:32) 
The number of burnt offerings that the assembly brought was this: seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs.

(2 Chronicles 29:33) 
They also consecrated to the Lord six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.

(2 Chronicles 29:34) 
However, the priests were too few in number and could not suffice to flay all the skins of the burnt offerings. Therefore, their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was completed and other priests could sanctify themselves. For the Levites were more diligent and more willing to purify themselves than the priests.

(2 Chronicles 29:35) 
For there were many burnt offerings, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus, the ceremonies of the House of the Lord were restored.

(2 Chronicles 29:36) 
And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because the service of the Lord's House had been completely restored, for the matter had been accomplished so swiftly.

(2 Chronicles 29:37) 
And Hezekiah rose up, and all the people who were with him, and went to the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:38) 
And Hezekiah commanded them to offer burnt offerings upon the altar, and to sacrifice peace offerings.

(2 Chronicles 29:39) 
And the people offered sacrifices and peace offerings, and all who willingly offered burnt offerings to the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 29:40) 
And in one day, the people offered one hundred seventy thousand burnt offerings.

(2 Chronicles 30:1) 
King Hezekiah sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel and Judah, and he also sent letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. The purpose was to invite everyone to come to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 30:2) 
For the king and his officials, along with the entire assembly in Jerusalem, had decided and agreed to celebrate the Passover in the second month.

(2 Chronicles 30:3) 
They could not celebrate the Passover at its usual, appointed time because only a few priests had completed the necessary purification rituals for themselves, and the people had not yet gathered in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 30:4) 
This decision was pleasing to the king and to the whole multitude of the people.

(2 Chronicles 30:5) 
So they issued a decree to proclaim throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba in the south to Dan in the north, that everyone should come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel. Many people had not celebrated it according to the law as it was written.

(2 Chronicles 30:6) 
So the runners went out with letters from the king and his officials throughout all Israel and Judah, as the king had commanded. They proclaimed: "Children of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Then He will turn back to the remnant of you who have escaped the hand of the king of Assyria."

(2 Chronicles 30:7) 
"Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who turned away from the Lord, the God of their fathers. He delivered them to destruction, as you yourselves can plainly see."

(2 Chronicles 30:8) 
"Do not be stubborn, as your fathers were. Submit yourselves to the Lord and come to His sanctuary, which He has sanctified for all time. Serve the Lord your God, so that the fierce anger of God may be removed from you."

(2 Chronicles 30:9) 
"For if you return to the Lord, your brothers and your children will find mercy before their captors, who led them away as prisoners, and they will return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful. He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him."

(2 Chronicles 30:10) 
So the runners traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the way to Zebulun. However, the people there mocked and ridiculed them.

(2 Chronicles 30:11) 
Nevertheless, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbling themselves and accepted the invitation, came to Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 30:12) 
In Judah also, the hand of the Lord was at work, giving them one heart and mind to obey the command of the king and the officials, according to the word of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 30:13) 
Consequently, many people gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month. It was an exceedingly large assembly.

(2 Chronicles 30:14) 
Then they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars where incense was burned to idols. They threw everything they tore down into the Kidron Valley.

(2 Chronicles 30:15) 
They sacrificed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites, feeling ashamed for their prior neglect, purified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 30:16) 
They stood in their assigned places according to the arrangement and the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests received the blood from the hands of the Levites.

(2 Chronicles 30:17) 
This was because a great many of the assembled people had not purified themselves properly. Therefore, the Levites sacrificed the Passover lambs on behalf of all those who were not purified, in order to consecrate them to the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 30:18) 
Indeed, a large part of the people—many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—had not been purified, yet they ate the Passover meal in a way that was not according to what was written in the law. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good Lord show mercy to everyone,

(2 Chronicles 30:19) 
who sincerely seeks the Lord, the God of their fathers, even if they have not observed the strict purification requirements. May He not hold it against them that they are less than perfectly purified."

(2 Chronicles 30:20) 
And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people, forgiving their impurity and allowing them to participate fully.

(2 Chronicles 30:21) 
So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. They praised the Lord every single day, with the Levites and priests playing musical instruments that were appropriate for their sacred art.

(2 Chronicles 30:22) 
Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who demonstrated good understanding in matters pertaining to the Lord. And for seven days, they ate the festival meals, offering peace offerings and confessing their sins and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 30:23) 
Then it pleased the entire assembly to celebrate for another seven days, and they did so with immense joy.

(2 Chronicles 30:24) 
King Hezekiah of Judah provided the assembly with a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep. The princes, for their part, contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Thus, a very large number of priests were purified and ready for service.

(2 Chronicles 30:25) 
And the entire assembly of Judah rejoiced—both the priests and the Levites, and all the multitude who had come from Israel. Even the foreigners, who had come from the land of Israel and from foreign lands, joined in the celebration.

(2 Chronicles 30:26) 
There was a great celebration in Jerusalem. Indeed, since the time of Solomon, son of David, had reigned in Jerusalem, nothing like this had happened in Israel.

(2 Chronicles 30:27) 
Then the priests and the Levites stood up and blessed the people. Their voice was heard in God’s holy sky, and their prayer reached His holy dwelling place.

(2 Chronicles 31:1) 
After King Hezekiah had properly celebrated these holy festivals, all the people of Israel who were present in the cities of Judah then went out. They broke the pagan idols, cut down the Asherah poles—which were false shrines to goddesses—tore down all the high places of false worship, and destroyed all the pagan altars throughout the territories of Judah and Benjamin. They even went into the northern territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, tearing down everything until all remnants of false worship were completely destroyed. After this, all the people of Israel returned to their own towns and homes.

(2 Chronicles 31:2) 
King Hezekiah then organized the priests and Levites into their appointed divisions. Each of them was assigned to their specific duty, whether priest or Levite, for offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, to serve and give thanks, and to sing praises at the entrances of the Lord's encampment—referring to the temple.

(2 Chronicles 31:3) 
The king also provided a portion from his own wealth for the burnt sacrifices, specifically for the morning and evening offerings, and for the burnt sacrifices on Sabbaths, New Moons, and other festival days, just as it is written in the Law of Moses.

(2 Chronicles 31:4) 
He also commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the assigned portions to the priests and Levites, so that they could dedicate themselves fully to the Law of the Lord without distraction.

(2 Chronicles 31:5) 
As soon as this command reached the hearts of all the people, the Israelites brought an abundance of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and every kind of produce from their fields. They brought in a full tenth of everything as offerings.

(2 Chronicles 31:6) 
Also, the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep. They also brought a tenth of all the holy offerings they had consecrated to the Lord their God. They piled these offerings up in many heaps.

(2 Chronicles 31:7) 
They began laying the foundations of these offering piles in the third month, which is around May/June, and they finished by the seventh month, around September/October.

(2 Chronicles 31:8) 
When King Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these large piles of offerings, they blessed the Lord and His people, Israel.

(2 Chronicles 31:9) 
King Hezekiah then asked the priests and Levites why there were so many of these piles of offerings.

(2 Chronicles 31:10) 
Azariah, the chief priest from the lineage of Zadok, replied to him, saying: "Ever since the people began to bring their offerings into the Lord's Temple, we priests have eaten and been fully satisfied. There is still a great abundance left over, because the Lord has blessed His people, and these piles you see are what remains."

(2 Chronicles 31:11) 
Then King Hezekiah commanded them to prepare storerooms within the Lord's Temple. When they had done this,

(2 Chronicles 31:12) 
they faithfully brought in the first fruits, the tithes, and all the consecrated offerings into these storerooms. Coneniah, a Levite, was appointed in charge of these provisions, with his brother Shimei as his assistant.

(2 Chronicles 31:13) 
Under the authority of Coneniah and his brother Shimei, and by the command of King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief officer of the Lord's Temple, the following men were appointed as overseers: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah.

(2 Chronicles 31:14) 
Kore, the son of Imnah, a Levite who was the doorkeeper of the eastern gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings made to the Lord. It was his duty to distribute the consecrated first fruits and all the dedicated offerings.

(2 Chronicles 31:15) 
Under Kore's authority, Eden, Benjamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their priestly brothers in their respective cities, giving each person their due share, regardless of age.

(2 Chronicles 31:16) 
This distribution was for every male from three years old and up, for all who came into the Lord's Temple for service, and for those among their own people who performed their daily duties, according to their assigned shifts and responsibilities.

(2 Chronicles 31:17) 
The priests also received their portions according to their family lines and households, and the Levites received theirs from twenty years old and up, according to their assigned duties and divisions.

(2 Chronicles 31:18) 
The portions were distributed to all their children—both young and old—their wives, sons, and daughters, and the entire assembly, because all these people faithfully dedicated themselves to the sacred services of the holy Temple.

(2 Chronicles 31:19) 
Furthermore, in every city throughout all of Judah, priests residing in the surrounding fields and pasturelands divided portions to every male descendant of the priestly lineage and to the Levites.

(2 Chronicles 31:20) 
So King Hezekiah did all these things we have described throughout Judah. He did what was good, upright, and true in the sight of the Lord his God.

(2 Chronicles 31:21) 
In every work he undertook concerning the service of the Lord's Temple, and regarding the Law and the Commandments, he sought his God with his whole heart, and he prospered greatly.

(2 Chronicles 32:1) 
After King Hezekiah had faithfully carried out these reforms and delivered these words of truth and encouragement to the people, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, invaded the land of Judah. He laid siege to its fortified cities, intending to conquer them all.

(2 Chronicles 32:2) 
When King Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had indeed invaded and that the entire force of the Assyrian war effort was now directed against Jerusalem:

(2 Chronicles 32:3) 
Hezekiah consulted with his officials and his most capable leaders. Together, they decided to block up the water sources that were outside the city walls. With everyone agreeing to the plan, they proceeded to cover them.

(2 Chronicles 32:4) 
A large number of people gathered together, and they blocked up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the middle of the land. They said, 'The kings of Assyria must not come here and find an abundance of water for themselves.'

(2 Chronicles 32:5) 
Hezekiah then strengthened the city's defenses. He rebuilt all the parts of the wall that had been broken down and added towers upon it. He also constructed another wall outside the existing one, and fortified the Millo, a stronghold in the City of David. Furthermore, he had weapons of every kind made, along with many shields.

(2 Chronicles 32:6) 
He appointed military commanders over the people. Then, gathering all the armed men, and with everyone swearing an oath of loyalty, he spoke to them:

(2 Chronicles 32:7) 
'Be strong and act courageously! Do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed by the king of Assyria or by the vast army that is with him. For there are far more with us than there are with him!'

(2 Chronicles 32:8) 
'With the king of Assyria is only the strength of mortal men, but with us is the Lord our God, who is powerful and will fight on our behalf!' And the people were greatly encouraged by the words of Hezekiah, the king of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 32:9) 
After these events, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his officials to Jerusalem. (Sennacherib himself, with his entire army, was then besieging the city of Lachish). He sent them to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all the people who were in Jerusalem, with this message:

(2 Chronicles 32:10) 
'This is what Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, says: In what do you place your trust, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?'

(2 Chronicles 32:11) 
'Does not Hezekiah mislead you, to deliver you over to the suffering of hunger and thirst, when he claims: The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?'

(2 Chronicles 32:12) 
'Is this not the same Hezekiah who destroyed the high places of worship and the altars, commanding Judah and Jerusalem, saying: You shall worship before only one altar, and upon it alone you shall burn incense?' —Sennacherib here misunderstands Hezekiah's reforms, which were against pagan idolatry, not true worship of God.

(2 Chronicles 32:13) 
'Are you unaware of what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of the various nations been able to deliver their lands from my hand?'

(2 Chronicles 32:14) 
'Who among all the gods of the nations, which my predecessors and I have utterly destroyed, has been able to rescue his people from my hand, that your God should be able to rescue you from this hand of mine?'

(2 Chronicles 32:15) 
'Therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor let him mislead you with such trivial persuasion! Do not believe him! If no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand and from the hand of my predecessors, then much less will your God be able to rescue you from my hand!'

(2 Chronicles 32:16) 
Furthermore, Sennacherib's officials spoke many other blasphemous words against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.

(2 Chronicles 32:17) 
He also wrote letters filled with blasphemy against the Lord God of Israel. He spoke against God as if He were merely one of the gods of the other nations of the earth—gods made by the hands of men.

(2 Chronicles 32:18) 
Then his officials shouted loudly in the Hebrew language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall. They did this to frighten them and cause them to surrender the city.

(2 Chronicles 32:19) 
They spoke of the God of Jerusalem just as they had spoken of the gods of the other peoples of the earth, saying they were merely the work of human hands.

(2 Chronicles 32:20) 
But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed against this situation. They cried out to God in the universe.

(2 Chronicles 32:21) 
So the Lord sent an angel, who eliminated all the strong, valiant warriors, and the commanders, and the officers of the army of the king of Assyria. Sennacherib then returned to his own land in utter shame. And when he entered the temple of his god, his own sons, who had come from his body, killed him there with the sword.

(2 Chronicles 32:22) 
Thus, the Lord saved King Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all their other enemies. He granted them peace on every side.

(2 Chronicles 32:23) 
Many people also brought gifts to the Lord in Jerusalem, and valuable presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. After these events, Hezekiah was exalted in the eyes of all the nations.

(2 Chronicles 32:24) 
In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was close to death. He prayed to the Lord, and the Lord heard him and gave him a sign.

(2 Chronicles 32:25) 
However, Hezekiah did not return thanks according to the benefits he had received from God. Instead, his heart became proud, and the Lord's wrath came upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 32:26) 
Yet, Hezekiah humbled himself because of the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Therefore, the Lord's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.

(2 Chronicles 32:27) 
Hezekiah also amassed countless treasures of silver and gold, and great glory. He built storehouses for his treasures, for grain, wine, and oil. He also built stalls for all types of livestock and folds for sheep.

(2 Chronicles 32:28) 
He also built cities and acquired an innumerable multitude of herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, and droves of pigs.

(2 Chronicles 32:29) 
He built cities for himself and acquired countless possessions of sheep and cattle, for God had indeed given him very great wealth.

(2 Chronicles 32:30) 
This was the same Hezekiah who blocked up the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them underground, bringing them to the west side of the City of David. All his undertakings were successful; everything that he did prospered.

(2 Chronicles 32:31) 
Nevertheless, concerning the delegation of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the astounding sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to be tested. This was so that everything that was in Hezekiah's heart might be revealed and known.

(2 Chronicles 32:32) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his deeds of mercy, are recorded in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

(2 Chronicles 32:33) 
Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in the highest part of the tombs of the sons of David. All of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 33:1) 
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 33:2) 
But he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, imitating the detestable practices of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out from the land before the children of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 33:3) 
He turned back and rebuilt the high places for pagan worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. He worshipped all the host of heaven—celestial bodies considered deities—and served them.

(2 Chronicles 33:4) 
He even built altars for these pagan gods inside the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord had said, 'My Name shall be in Jerusalem forever.'

(2 Chronicles 33:5) 
He built altars for all the host of heaven—the celestial deities—in both courtyards of the house of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 33:6) 
Indeed, he even burned his own sons as sacrifices in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. He practiced divination, followed omens, engaged in sorcery, and consulted with mediums and spirits of the dead. He multiplied evil in the sight of the Lord, so as to provoke Him to anger.

(2 Chronicles 33:7) 
He carved an idol, an engraved image, and set it up in the temple of the Lord, concerning which the Lord had spoken to David and to Solomon his son, saying, 'In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever.'

(2 Chronicles 33:8) 
And I will no longer move the foot of Israel from the land which I delivered to their fathers; that is, only if they carefully keep all that I have commanded them—the whole Law, the ceremonies, and the judgments given through Moses.

(2 Chronicles 33:9) 
So Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, causing them to do more evil than the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 33:10) 
The Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they refused to listen to Him.

(2 Chronicles 33:11) 
Therefore, the Lord brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. When they captured Manasseh, they bound him with chains and fetters and brought him to Babylon as a prisoner.

(2 Chronicles 33:12) 
While he was in distress, he earnestly prayed to the Lord his God. He repented deeply before the God of his fathers.

(2 Chronicles 33:13) 
He pleaded with Him, imploring Him beyond measure, and God heard him. God brought him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord Himself was God.

(2 Chronicles 33:14) 
After this, he built an outer wall for the City of David, to the west of Gihon in the valley, and from the entrance of the Fish Gate all around to Ophel. He raised it to a great height. He also appointed commanders of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah.

(2 Chronicles 33:15) 
He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord. He also commanded that all the altars he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem be taken away and cast far outside the city.

(2 Chronicles 33:16) 
He also restored the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings upon it. He commanded Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 33:17) 
Nevertheless, the people still offered sacrifices on the high places, though they were now dedicated to the Lord their God.

(2 Chronicles 33:18) 
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him—these are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 33:19) 
His prayer also, and how God heard it, and all his sins and his contempt for God, and the places where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols—before he repented—these are written in the book of the seers (Hozai).

(2 Chronicles 33:20) 
So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his place.

(2 Chronicles 33:21) 
Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 33:22) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Manasseh his father had done. He sacrificed to all the idols that Manasseh had made, and he served them.

(2 Chronicles 33:23) 
He did not humble himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself. Indeed, Amon sinned much more grievously than his father.

(2 Chronicles 33:24) 
When his servants conspired against him, they killed him in his own house.

(2 Chronicles 33:25) 
But the rest of the people killed all those who had conspired against Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.

(2 Chronicles 34:1) 
Josiah was eight years old when he began to rule as king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 34:2) 
And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord,
walking in the righteous ways of his ancestor David,
without deviating either to the right or to the left.

(2 Chronicles 34:3) 
In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a young man,
he began to seek the true God of his ancestor David.
Then, in the twelfth year, he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem
from all the false worship at the high places,
destroying the sacred groves, and breaking down all the carved idols
and molten images used in pagan rituals.

(2 Chronicles 34:4) 
Before King Josiah, his men tore down the altars dedicated to Baal worship.
He utterly demolished the idols that had been placed on top of these altars.
Then he cut down all the sacred groves and shattered the carved images into fragments.
Finally, he scattered these fragments over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to these false gods.

(2 Chronicles 34:5) 
He also burned the bones of the pagan priests upon their idolatrous altars.
Through these acts, he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem from defilement.

(2 Chronicles 34:6) 
And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and extending even to Naphtali,
he thoroughly destroyed all the places of worship,
overthrowing the altars.

(2 Chronicles 34:7) 
He crushed the sacred groves and carved images into tiny pieces.
He demolished every single idolatrous altar throughout the entire land of Israel.
After this extensive work, he returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 34:8) 
Then, in the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had cleansed the land and the Temple from pagan worship,
King Josiah sent Zadok the son of Ezekiel, and Raiah the son of Maaseiah, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the chancellor,
with a mission to restore and repair the House of the Lord, their God.

(2 Chronicles 34:9) 
These men came to Hilkiah the high priest and received from him the money
that had been brought into the House of the Lord.
This money had been contributed by the Levites and the gatekeepers
from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the rest of Israel,
as well as from all of Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 34:10) 
They then gave the money into the hand of those who were overseeing the workers in the House of the Lord.
These overseers were to distribute it to the laborers who were working on the Temple,
specifically for the restoration of the Temple's upper parts and structures.

(2 Chronicles 34:11) 
They also gave funds to the craftsmen and masons,
so they could purchase quarried stones and timber
for the structural joints of the building and for the roofing and beams.

(2 Chronicles 34:12) 
All of these workers carried out their tasks faithfully.
The Levites appointed as supervisors for the work were Jahath and Obadiah, sons of Merari,
and Zechariah and Meshullam, from the sons of Kohath; these men diligently urged on the work.
Other Levites, all skilled in musical instruments, were also involved.

(2 Chronicles 34:13) 
Moreover, those who were overseeing the masons and each individual task,
assigned their own men to various duties.
These included Levites who were educated as scribes, as well as overseers and gatekeepers.

(2 Chronicles 34:14) 
As they were taking out the money that had been brought into the Temple of the Lord,
Hilkiah the priest discovered the book of the Law of the Lord, written by the hand of Moses.

(2 Chronicles 34:15) 
Hilkiah then said to Shaphan the scribe,
"I have found the book of the Law in the House of the Lord!"
And he gave the book to Shaphan.

(2 Chronicles 34:16) 
Shaphan then brought the book to the king and reported to him, saying,
"All the money that was given into the hand of your servants has been accounted for and disbursed."

(2 Chronicles 34:17) 
He continued, "They have even melted down the silver that was found in the House of the Lord,
and they have given it to the overseers of the craftsmen and to the artisans."

(2 Chronicles 34:18) 
Shaphan then added, "Furthermore, I have found a book in the House of the Lord."
And Shaphan presented the book to the king.

(2 Chronicles 34:19) 
When the king read the words of the Law and heard its pronouncements,
he was so distressed that he tore his garments in a sign of repentance and mourning.

(2 Chronicles 34:20) 
Then King Josiah commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying:

(2 Chronicles 34:21) 
"Go and inquire of the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel and Judah,
concerning all the words of the book that has been found.
For great indeed is the wrath of the Lord that has been poured out upon us,
because our fathers did not keep the words of the Lord,
and did not do all that is written in this very book."

(2 Chronicles 34:22) 
So Hilkiah and those who had been sent with him by the king went to Huldah the prophetess.
She was the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe.
She resided in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter of the city.
They spoke to her the words which we have related above.

(2 Chronicles 34:23) 
She answered them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:
'Say to the man who sent you to me:

(2 Chronicles 34:24) 
Thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants,
all the curses that are written in this book which they have read before the king of Judah:

(2 Chronicles 34:25) 
Because they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to foreign gods,
provoking Me to righteous anger with all the works of their hands,
therefore My burning wrath will be poured out upon this place and it will not be extinguished.'"

(2 Chronicles 34:26) 
But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, you shall say this:
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:

(2 Chronicles 34:27) 
Because your heart was softened when you heard the words of the book,
and you humbled yourself before God concerning what was spoken against this place and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
and because you humbled yourself before Me, and tore your garments, and wept before Me,
I have indeed heard you, declares the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 34:28) 
Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be brought to your tomb in peace.
Your eyes will not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place and upon its inhabitants."
So they reported to the king all that Huldah had said.

(2 Chronicles 34:29) 
Therefore, the king convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 34:30) 
Then the king went up to the House of the Lord,
and with him went all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the priests, the Levites, and all the people, from the least to the greatest.
In their hearing, the king read all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the House of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 34:31) 
The king stood in his place of authority and made a solemn covenant before the Lord:
that he would walk after the Lord and keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes
with all his heart and with all his soul,
and that he would fulfill all that was written in that book which had been found.

(2 Chronicles 34:32) 
He also compelled all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand by this covenant.
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 34:33) 
So Josiah removed all the abominations from all the regions of the sons of Israel.
He made all who remained in Israel serve the Lord their God.
Throughout all his days, they did not turn away from the Lord, the God of their fathers.

(2 Chronicles 35:1) 
Josiah celebrated the Lord's Passover in Jerusalem, and they sacrificed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.

(2 Chronicles 35:2) 
He appointed the priests to their duties and strengthened them for the service of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 35:3) 
Then he spoke to the Levites, whose name was sacred among all Israel and who were consecrated to the Lord, saying: "Place the Ark in the temple that Solomon, the son of David, King of Israel, built. Let it no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now, serve the Lord your God and His people, Israel."

(2 Chronicles 35:4) 
And prepare yourselves according to your families and clans in their respective divisions, just as David, the king of Israel, commanded and as Solomon, his son, wrote.

(2 Chronicles 35:5) 
Serve in the sanctuary by your Levitical families and groups, with your brethren, the sons of the people, presiding, and by the courses of the Levitical clans.

(2 Chronicles 35:6) 
And sacrifice the Passover lambs. Consecrate yourselves and prepare your brethren to act according to the word of the Lord, which He spoke through Moses.

(2 Chronicles 35:7) 
Josiah also gave to the people, from his own royal possessions, for the celebration of the Passover, thirty thousand lambs and young goats from all the flocks, and three thousand oxen.

(2 Chronicles 35:8) 
His officials also freely offered gifts, both to the people and to the priests and Levites. Furthermore, Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chiefs of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests for the Passover sacrifice two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred oxen.

(2 Chronicles 35:9) 
Also Conaniah, Shemaiah, and Nethanel, his brethren, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the celebration of the Passover five thousand sheep and five hundred oxen.

(2 Chronicles 35:10) 
So everything was prepared, and the priests stood in their offices, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's command.

(2 Chronicles 35:11) 
And they sacrificed the Passover lambs. The priests then offered the blood, receiving it from the hands of the Levites, and the Levites took care of the skins.

(2 Chronicles 35:12) 
They then set aside the burnt offerings according to what is written in the book of Moses; likewise for the oxen, as is the custom.

(2 Chronicles 35:13) 
And they cooked the Passover lambs with fire, as the Law requires. The burnt offerings, however, they boiled in pots, cauldrons, and pans, and they quickly distributed them to all the people.

(2 Chronicles 35:14) 
After this, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were occupied with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until nightfall. For this reason, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.

(2 Chronicles 35:15) 
Furthermore, the singers, the sons of Asaph, stood in their appointed places according to the command of David, and Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's prophets. The gatekeepers were also at each gate.

(2 Chronicles 35:16) 
So all the service of the Lord was duly celebrated on that day, as they made the Passover and offered burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord according to the command of King Josiah.

(2 Chronicles 35:17) 
And the children of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, along with the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.

(2 Chronicles 35:18) 
Therefore, there had been no Passover like this in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. Nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah performed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, and the Israelites who were present, and those living in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 35:19) 
This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.

(2 Chronicles 35:20) 
After Josiah had duly completed all these things in the temple, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates. And Josiah went out to meet him in battle.

(2 Chronicles 35:21) 
But Neco sent messengers to him, saying: "What business do I have with you, King of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against another house, to which I am hastening. Refrain from opposing me, lest you destroy yourself. For God has commanded me to hurry. Stop opposing God, who is with me, lest He destroy you."

(2 Chronicles 35:22) 
Josiah, however, refused to turn back, but prepared for battle against Neco. He would not listen to the words of Neco, which came from the mouth of God, but went to fight in the plain of Megiddo.

(2 Chronicles 35:23) 
There, being wounded by archers, he said to his servants: "Take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."

(2 Chronicles 35:24) 
And his servants carried him from his chariot into another chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. He died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.

(2 Chronicles 35:25) 
Jeremiah also composed a lamentation for Josiah. And all the male and female singers recite their lamentations over Josiah even to this present day, and it became like a custom in Israel. Indeed, it is written in the Lamentations.

(2 Chronicles 35:26) 
Now the rest of the deeds of Josiah, his acts of devotion, and his works, are written according to what is written in the Law of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 35:27) 
Both his former and latter deeds are written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

(2 Chronicles 36:1) 
So the people living in the land of Judah took Josiah’s son, Jehoahaz. They then made him king in Jerusalem, to reign in place of his father, Josiah.

(2 Chronicles 36:2) 
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began his reign. He only reigned for three months in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 36:3) 
But the king of Egypt removed him from his throne, preventing him from ruling any longer in Jerusalem. And that king imposed a heavy tax on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.

(2 Chronicles 36:4) 
The king of Egypt then made Jehoahaz’s brother, Eliakim, the new king in his place. He changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz himself, the Egyptian king had taken him away and brought him to Egypt.

(2 Chronicles 36:5) 
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began his reign. He reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did evil things in the sight of the Lord his God.

(2 Chronicles 36:6) 
Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up against Jehoiakim. He bound him with chains and took him away as a prisoner to Babylon.

(2 Chronicles 36:7) 
Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the sacred vessels from the Lord’s Temple. He placed these holy items in his own pagan temple in Babylon.

(2 Chronicles 36:8) 
The rest of the account of Jehoiakim’s reign, including the detestable things he did, and what was found concerning him, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. Then his son, Jehoiachin, became king in his place.

(2 Chronicles 36:9) 
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began his reign. He reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He also did evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 36:10) 
At the beginning of the new year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent men and had Jehoiachin brought to Babylon. At the same time, Nebuchadnezzar took away the most precious vessels from the Lord’s Temple. He then appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, as the new king over Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 36:11) 
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his reign. He reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 36:12) 
He did evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah, even though Jeremiah spoke to him directly from the mouth of the Lord.

(2 Chronicles 36:13) 
Furthermore, Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear an oath of loyalty by invoking God’s name. Zedekiah stubbornly stiffened his neck and hardened his heart, refusing to turn back to the Lord, the God of Israel.

(2 Chronicles 36:14) 
Moreover, all the chief priests and the people in general were utterly wicked. They multiplied their detestable practices, adopting all the abominations of the pagan nations around them. In doing so, they defiled the Lord’s Temple, the very house that God Himself had consecrated in Jerusalem.

(2 Chronicles 36:15) 
The Lord, the God of their ancestors, continually sent messengers to His people. He rose early and sent them again and again, warning them daily. He did this because He felt compassion for His people and for His dwelling place, the Temple.

(2 Chronicles 36:16) 
But the people mocked God’s messengers. They scorned His words and scoffed at His prophets. They continued this until the Lord’s wrath was so kindled against His people that there was no remedy or cure left for them.

(2 Chronicles 36:17) 
Therefore, the Lord brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, Nebuchadnezzar. He slaughtered their young men with the sword right within their own sanctuary, the Temple. He showed no pity for young men, nor for virgins, nor for the elderly, nor even for the very weak. He gave all of them into the hands of the Chaldean king.

(2 Chronicles 36:18) 
All the vessels of the Lord’s Temple—both the large and small ones—and the treasures of the Temple, along with the treasures of the king and his officials, Nebuchadnezzar delivered all of these into the Chaldean king’s hands.

(2 Chronicles 36:19) 
The enemies, the Chaldeans, set fire to God’s house, the Temple. They tore down the walls of Jerusalem. They burned all the fortified towers and demolished everything that had been valuable and precious.

(2 Chronicles 36:20) 
Those who escaped the sword were led away as captives to Babylon. There, they became servants to Nebuchadnezzar and his descendants, until the kingdom of Persia began to reign.

(2 Chronicles 36:21) 
This all happened so that the word of the Lord, spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, might be fulfilled. The land of Judah finally enjoyed its Sabbaths. Throughout all the days of its desolation, the land kept Sabbath rest until seventy years were completed, as prophesied.

(2 Chronicles 36:22) 
In the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord that He had spoken through Jeremiah, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. So Cyrus issued a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, even in writing, saying:

(2 Chronicles 36:23) 
“Thus says Cyrus, the king of Persia: ‘The Lord, the God of the universe, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He Himself has commanded me to build Him a house of worship in Jerusalem, which is located in Judea.’
