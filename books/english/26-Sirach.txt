(Sirach 1:1) 
All wisdom comes from the Lord God; it has always been with Him. Wisdom existed before the beginning of time.

(Sirach 1:2) 
Who can count the sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?

(Sirach 1:3) 
Who has searched the height of the sky, the width of the land, and the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 1:4) 
Wisdom was created before all other things, and the understanding of prudence is eternal.

(Sirach 1:5) 
The Word of God in the highest heavens is the source of wisdom, and His eternal commandments are the path to it.

(Sirach 1:6) 
To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? Who has known its cleverness?

(Sirach 1:7) 
Who can describe the knowledge of wisdom? Who has understood its meaning?

(Sirach 1:8) 
There is only one Most High, the all-powerful creator, a mighty King, greatly to be feared, seated on His throne, and a God who rules.

(Sirach 1:9) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit; He saw it, measured it, and gave it understanding.

(Sirach 1:10) 
And He poured out wisdom on all His works, on all flesh according to His gift, and gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 1:11) 
The fear of the Lord is glory, and pride, and joy, and the crown of rejoicing.

(Sirach 1:12) 
The fear of the Lord delights the heart and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 1:13) 
It will go well with the man who fears God in the end, and he will be blessed on the day of his death.

(Sirach 1:14) 
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; it was formed with the faithful in the womb.

(Sirach 1:15) 
It was created with believers and saints, and with the chosen, they are found with faithfulness, knowledge, and belief.

(Sirach 1:16) 
The fear of the Lord is the fullness of the knowledge of piety.

(Sirach 1:17) 
Piety protects them, makes them righteous, and accepts their prayers.

(Sirach 1:18) 
Whoever fears God will have friendship, and his neighbor will be like him.

(Sirach 1:19) 
In wisdom is honor, and glory, and trust, and the crown of righteousness.

(Sirach 1:20) 
The wisdom of the just brings blessings, and the fruit of his glory is honorable.

(Sirach 1:21) 
An enemy of the wicked is not honorable, and the memory of the wicked will be erased.

(Sirach 1:22) 
In the fear of the Lord is length of days, and the years of life will be shortened.

(Sirach 1:23) 
Whoever fears God will do all things, and whoever holds himself back for Him, will be filled on the day of visitation.

(Sirach 1:24) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the acceptance of Him, and it adheres to Him with faith.

(Sirach 1:25) 
All plagues and all anger will come to the wicked, and will not be found in sinners.

(Sirach 1:26) 
Whoever fears God will not neglect His commandments, and the strong will keep His way because of Him.

(Sirach 1:27) 
And all wisdom will know, and those who hold it will praise it; and those who trust in it will be known to Him.

(Sirach 2:1) 
Son, when you are serving God, stand strong in righteousness and with fear, and prepare your soul for the trials ahead.

(Sirach 2:2) 
Humble your heart and remain patient: incline your ear, and understand words of wisdom.

(Sirach 2:3) 
Open your heart to God, and trust in Him, and keep yourself from the abominations of sin.

(Sirach 2:4) 
Look at His commandments, and observe His precepts: and hear your prayer.

(Sirach 2:5) 
Return to the Lord and leave behind your sin: pray in His presence, and reduce your faults.

(Sirach 2:6) 
Turn away from sin, and correct your hands: and cleanse your heart from all impurity of your heart.

(Sirach 2:7) 
And direct your path in the right way, and turn to the elders and the righteous.

(Sirach 2:8) 
Be steadfast in faith and in the fear of God: and remain in peace with patience.

(Sirach 2:9) 
Trust in Him who believes in himself: and he shall not be ashamed in His mercy.

(Sirach 2:10) 
Woe to the double-minded heart, and to the impure lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner who walks the earth with two paths.

(Sirach 2:11) 
Woe to the timid heart: for he does not believe, therefore he will not be protected.

(Sirach 2:12) 
Woe to him who loses patience: and what will he do when the Lord visits?

(Sirach 2:13) 
He who fears God shall persevere, and in his patience he will be justified.

(Sirach 2:14) 
He shall look to himself, and confirm his ways, and understand that iniquity will not dwell in him.

(Sirach 2:15) 
He who fears God will do this: and he who has the law, will turn to these things.

(Sirach 2:16) 
And he who knows them will prepare for them, and will seek them as in the harvest.

(Sirach 2:17) 
He who fears God will direct his ways, and will be enlightened as in the time of the solstice.

(Sirach 2:18) 
And those who trust in the Lord will understand His glory.

(Sirach 2:19) 
Do not fear the words of the sinner: for his glory is consumed in dung.

(Sirach 2:20) 
He will exult in the days of his prosperity, and in the days of adversity he will not be remembered.

(Sirach 2:21) 
The fear of God is of fear, and it will not perish: and in the days of trial, the righteous will persevere.

(Sirach 2:22) 
The wise man does not hate the law of God, and there will be no lie in it, and the impious perish in it.

(Sirach 2:23) 
He who fears God directs his heart, and humbles his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 2:24) 
If you do not do this, you will fall into evil: and God will confound you in the sight of your enemies.

(Sirach 2:25) 
Hold fast to righteousness until death, and fight for the truth, and God will fight for you against your enemies.

(Sirach 2:26) 
Do not be quick with your tongue: and be negligent in your works.

(Sirach 2:27) 
Be quick to listen to God, and answer in your patience: if you have understanding.

(Sirach 2:28) 
If you have understanding, answer your neighbor: but if not, put your hand upon your mouth, lest you be caught in an undisciplined word, and be ashamed.

(Sirach 2:29) 
Have no preference in glory and shame, and do not be afraid to confess your sins in truth.

(Sirach 2:30) 
Do not be like a lion in your house, looking at your servants, and frightening them.

(Sirach 2:31) 
Let your hand not be for receiving, and let it be slow to give.

(Sirach 3:1) 
My son, listen to me, and respond to my voice, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 3:2) 
Because great is His glory, and great is His grace, and who will search out His fear?

(Sirach 3:3) 
The fear of the Lord brings glory, and boasting, and joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 3:4) 
The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, and give joy, and gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 3:5) 
He who fears God will be well in the end, and in the day of consummation he will be saved.

(Sirach 3:6) 
He will not fear fear, nor will he be troubled: because he is his hope.

(Sirach 3:7) 
The fear of God is like a paradise of blessing: they have covered all glory.

(Sirach 3:8) 
Everyone who feared the Lord, he received, and blessing him.

(Sirach 3:9) 
Because the fear of God, and honor, and joy, and the crown of exultation is.

(Sirach 3:10) 
Choosing the fear of God, and his works, and his love, and his ways.

(Sirach 3:11) 
He who holds Him is prepared for everything, and his life will not be separated because of Him.

(Sirach 3:12) 
The beginning of all evils is pride: he who is held by it, will abound in impiety.

(Sirach 3:13) 
Therefore the proud are crushed, and as a rod they are crushed: and their memory is iniquitous, and it will not be.

(Sirach 3:14) 
The pleasing of God is not for the proud: because they are turned away from God.

(Sirach 3:15) 
Pride is the beginning of all sin: he who holds it, will pour out impiety: therefore God has discovered harsh vices, and overturned them.

(Sirach 3:16) 
God has overturned the seats of the proud leaders.

(Sirach 3:17) 
God has taken away iniquitous nations.

(Sirach 3:18) 
God has uprooted the roots of the proud.

(Sirach 3:19) 
God sits on the throne of judgment, and in his spirit there is no iniquity.

(Sirach 3:20) 
Who will tell the works of the Most High? Because they are His wonders.

(Sirach 3:21) 
Who will tell the power of His majesty? And who will be able to tell His mercy?

(Sirach 3:22) 
Nothing is diminished, and nothing is added, nor can the wonders of God be found.

(Sirach 3:23) 
When man finishes, then he will begin: and when he rests, then he will doubt.

(Sirach 3:24) 
What is man? And what is his grace? What is his good, or what is his evil?

(Sirach 3:25) 
The number of days of men, all at most are one hundred years.

(Sirach 3:26) 
Like a drop of sea water, and like a grain of sand, so few are the years in the day of eternity.

(Sirach 3:27) 
This is the glory of man: and greater than that, is not for him in his life.

(Sirach 3:28) 
His blood is his flesh, and his spirit: the works of the wicked will be broken.

(Sirach 3:29) 
Piety, and mercy will remain, and good works: and their reward with them.

(Sirach 3:30) 
My soul is pleased with two kinds, and the third is pleasing to me: he who is grieved, and he who loves his brothers.

(Sirach 3:31) 
He who does not sin with his tongue, and is not grieved in his mind.

(Sirach 3:32) 
He who is not grieved in his mind, will not be grieved in his works.

(Sirach 3:33) 
He who fears God in his heart, and is justified in all signs.

(Sirach 4:1) 
My son, if you give yourself to serving God, brace yourself for the trials of faith.

(Sirach 4:2) 
Set your heart straight, be resolute, and don't rush in times of hardship.

(Sirach 4:3) 
Stay close to Him, and don't turn away, so that you may be rewarded in the end.

(Sirach 4:4) 
Accept whatever is brought upon you, and be patient in times of pain.

(Sirach 4:5) 
Gold is tested by fire, and acceptable men are tested in the furnace of hardship.

(Sirach 4:6) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you; make your ways straight, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 4:7) 
Those who fear God will not tremble, and will not be afraid, because He is their hope.

(Sirach 4:8) 
Blessed is the soul of those who fear God.

(Sirach 4:9) 
Because of their fear of God, they will love Him, and in their faith, they will hope.

(Sirach 4:10) 
Those who fear God will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 4:11) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of men.

(Sirach 4:12) 
For as great as He is, so is His mercy, and as great as His name, so is His glory.

(Sirach 4:13) 
God will have mercy on those who confess and give thanks to Him in the sight of all.

(Sirach 4:14) 
The fool will be troubled in times of evil.

(Sirach 4:15) 
The wise will not be troubled by evils.

(Sirach 4:16) 
A wise heart will understand a parable, and an attentive ear will desire wisdom.

(Sirach 4:17) 
As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 4:18) 
He who gives thanks will remember the future, and will find strength in the time of need.

(Sirach 4:19) 
The sons of evildoers are like a mist driven by the wind, here today, and gone tomorrow.

(Sirach 4:20) 
Blessed is he who perseveres in the fear of God.

(Sirach 4:21) 
Because in the end, he will be saved.

(Sirach 4:22) 
Those who love God choose such fear of God.

(Sirach 4:23) 
Those who fear the Lord do His will, and those who endure in Him will find blessing.

(Sirach 4:24) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 4:25) 
They will fall into the hands of God.

(Sirach 4:26) 
Better is the one who has no means and boasts, than he who has means and lies.

(Sirach 4:27) 
More precious is he who is not rich but fears God, than he who is rich and proud.

(Sirach 4:28) 
A just and poor man, fearing God, is better than a rich and arrogant man.

(Sirach 4:29) 
A wise and poor man, in the fear of God, will please God more than a rich, and very proud man.

(Sirach 4:30) 
The death of the just is in God's hand, and evil will not touch them.

(Sirach 4:31) 
But fools and sinners will be destroyed by His wrath.

(Sirach 4:32) 
The fear of the Lord brings health and fullness, and His visitation takes away sins.

(Sirach 4:33) 
He who fears Him will not fear; and will not be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 4:34) 
Of the fear of the Lord, nothing is to be feared, and there is no fear in disturbance.

(Sirach 4:35) 
Blessed is everyone who fears God.

(Sirach 4:36) 
For by the fear of the Lord he is helped, and in the days of the end, he will hope well.

(Sirach 4:37) 
The fear of God belongs to all creation; and to it, God gives glory.

(Sirach 4:38) 
It is better to die than to live and see evil.

(Sirach 4:39) 
A sad life, and a voluntary death.

(Sirach 4:40) 
In all your work, remember your last end, and you will not sin forever.

(Sirach 5:1) 
Do not put your trust in an enemy, and do not give yourself over to his authority.

(Sirach 5:2) 
Because all men conceal the sins they do against themselves.

(Sirach 5:3) 
Be cautious around your neighbor, because he seeks to harm you.

(Sirach 5:4) 
And his hatred could turn against you.

(Sirach 5:5) 
Do not believe everything you hear; for every tongue has its own faults.

(Sirach 5:6) 
Because in their wicked deeds, they sin.

(Sirach 5:7) 
And they do not live in the fear of God.

(Sirach 5:8) 
For God's eyes watch over the ways of men, and He knows every path.

(Sirach 5:9) 
He has not commanded anyone to act wickedly, nor has He given anyone permission to sin.

(Sirach 5:10) 
He does not rejoice in works of the flesh, nor does the impious man hold power over Him.

(Sirach 5:11) 
Before men's good and bad deeds, the Lord sees all; He sees them.

(Sirach 5:12) 
He looks upon each of their works.

(Sirach 5:13) 
Do not say, “I have sinned, and what has happened to me?”

(Sirach 5:14) 
For the Most High is patient.

(Sirach 5:15) 
But as for atonement, be without fear. Do not add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 5:16) 
And do not say, “God’s mercy is great, and He forgives many sins.”

(Sirach 5:17) 
Because mercy and anger are swift with Him, and His wrath rests upon sinners.

(Sirach 5:18) 
Do not delay turning back to the Lord, nor put it off day by day.

(Sirach 5:19) 
For suddenly His wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance you will perish.

(Sirach 5:20) 
Do not put your trust in unjust riches, nor say, “I have enough for life.”

(Sirach 5:21) 
For they will not help you on the day of wrath and vengeance.

(Sirach 5:22) 
Do not follow the paths of your heart and your own strength.

(Sirach 5:23) 
And do not say, “Who will restrain me?”

(Sirach 5:24) 
Because God can surely punish,

(Sirach 5:25) 
and know that God will not delay long.

(Sirach 5:26) 
Do not be without fear of your sins, and do not add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 5:27) 
And do not say, “God’s mercy is great, and He will forgive many of my sins.”

(Sirach 5:28) 
Because both mercy and wrath are swift with Him, and His wrath rests upon the impious.

(Sirach 5:29) 
Do not delay turning to the Lord, and do not put it off day by day.

(Sirach 5:30) 
For suddenly His wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance you will perish.

(Sirach 5:31) 
Like the pains of a woman in labor, is the day of wrath for the impious.

(Sirach 5:32) 
He will carry the son he thought was dead, but he will have no help.

(Sirach 5:33) 
Such is the day of visitation for the impious.

(Sirach 6:1) 
I wish to speak of wisdom and discipline, and of the understanding of the senses.

(Sirach 6:2) 
For, as wisdom comes from God, it is also glorious.

(Sirach 6:3) 
In the beginning, God created it, and poured it out over all His works.

(Sirach 6:4) 
When there is fear of the Lord, there is glory, honor, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 6:5) 
The heart of God has chosen the fear of the Lord, and he has kept it in sanctification, justice, and faith.

(Sirach 6:6) 
The fear of God is the commandments, and discipline preserves life.

(Sirach 6:7) 
Those who fear God will fear nothing and will not be afraid, because He is their hope.

(Sirach 6:8) 
The soul of the fear of God is life, and those who have it will be visited by God, and will be blessed.

(Sirach 6:9) 
The wise will receive it, and, as a mother, will honor it, and, as a bride marrying, will receive it.

(Sirach 6:10) 
And it will nourish them with the bread of life, and will give them the water of salvation.

(Sirach 6:11) 
The foundation of wisdom is to fear God, and to keep faith, to love, and to keep the words of the just in justice and with others.

(Sirach 6:12) 
Pride is the abomination of the wicked; the just are not near to pride.

(Sirach 6:13) 
The beginning of pride is for a man to apostatize from God: because his heart has receded from Him who made him.

(Sirach 6:14) 
The beginning of pride is sin: and those who hold it pour out abominations.

(Sirach 6:15) 
Therefore, the Lord has brought upon them terrible plagues: and He has broken them to the end.

(Sirach 6:16) 
As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sins.

(Sirach 6:17) 
Those who give back good deeds will be mindful of the future: in the time when their feet falter, they will find firmness.

(Sirach 6:18) 
Those who keep the commandments guard their souls: and those who hope in God will not be ashamed.

(Sirach 6:19) 
The fear of the Lord is the glory of the wise.

(Sirach 6:20) 
The wise keep justice: and those who practice justice refer to His glory.

(Sirach 6:21) 
The wise works in words: and the prudent are confirmed in the law.

(Sirach 6:22) 
Those who trust in the law prepare understanding, and those who perfect it, are, as a river, full of wisdom.

(Sirach 6:23) 
Those who cultivate the law prepare it: and its fruit is sanctification.

(Sirach 6:24) 
Still pursuing it, they will arrive at it: and its paths are very clear, and they will not labor on its road.

(Sirach 6:25) 
The wise will pass through the earth, so that they may give testimony: and all those who understand will seek it.

(Sirach 6:26) 
Seeking it, as the first, and the Lord will not fail at any time.

(Sirach 6:27) 
And again I considered in my heart, so that I may know what is good, and what I should do, and I will keep discipline.

(Sirach 6:28) 
And again I began to love it, and found it good.

(Sirach 6:29) 
Those who choose good, will be chosen, and those who love its works, will be sanctified.

(Sirach 6:30) 
Those who do its works, their life is always good.

(Sirach 7:1) 
Don't do evil deeds, and evil won't befall you.

(Sirach 7:2) 
Turn away from wickedness, and wickedness will turn away from you.

(Sirach 7:3) 
My son, don't plant bad seeds in the furrows of wickedness, or you'll harvest them sevenfold.

(Sirach 7:4) 
Don't ask the Lord for a position of authority, nor the king for a seat of honor.

(Sirach 7:5) 
Don't try to justify yourself before God, because He knows the hearts of all.

(Sirach 7:6) 
Don't desire to be a judge unless you are strong in virtue. Don't be afraid of the powerful. Then, your justice won't be a stumbling block.

(Sirach 7:7) 
Don't sin against the multitude of a city, and don't thrust yourself upon the people.

(Sirach 7:8) 
Don't commit a double sin: because not even one will go unpunished.

(Sirach 7:9) 
Don't say: “God will look at the multitude of my gifts and, when I give them to the Most High, He will accept them.”

(Sirach 7:10) 
Don't be doubtful in your prayers, and don't neglect to do good deeds.

(Sirach 7:11) 
Don't mock the scornful, because there is One who sees and punishes.

(Sirach 7:12) 
Don't neglect the poor when you judge, because there is One who defends the poor.

(Sirach 7:13) 
Make the judgment of the poor, and don't be swayed by the powerful.

(Sirach 7:14) 
Judge according to wisdom, and give a just judgment.

(Sirach 7:15) 
Humble your heart and be patient, and incline your ear and receive the words of the wise. Don't disregard the proverbs of the wise and practice them in their parables.

(Sirach 7:16) 
My son, work on your work, and you will be educated in its doctrine.

(Sirach 7:17) 
Those who fear the Lord will find judgment, and their righteousness will shine like light.

(Sirach 7:18) 
The sinner will flee from correction and will find excuses according to his own will.

(Sirach 7:19) 
A man of counsel will not neglect counsel. The timid and lazy will not remain in the commandments.

(Sirach 7:20) 
Do nothing without counsel, and after you've done it, you won't repent.

(Sirach 7:21) 
Don't walk on an unsafe road, and don't stumble on stones.

(Sirach 7:22) 
Don't trust in your own faith alone; guard your ways.

(Sirach 7:23) 
Don't be disheartened in your works.

(Sirach 7:24) 
Be faithful in all your works. This is the keeping of the commandments.

(Sirach 7:25) 
He who believes in God attends to the commandments, and he who hopes in Him will not be diminished.

(Sirach 8:1) 
Don’t start a fight with anyone stronger than you, or you may fall into their power.

(Sirach 8:2) 
Many have ruined themselves seeking riches, and they could not use those riches to save their souls.

(Sirach 8:3) 
For the value of a soul is beyond all price.

(Sirach 8:4) 
Don’t waste your goods on the wrong things, or your labor on what is not yours.

(Sirach 8:5) 
Don't be overconfident in your own power, and don't go after all of your desires.

(Sirach 8:6) 
Don’t say, “Who can stop me now that I’m in control?” Remember that bad days happen to everyone.

(Sirach 8:7) 
Don't be overwhelmed by your feelings, and don't let your imagination run wild.

(Sirach 8:8) 
Don’t say, “God is so merciful that he will forgive all my sins,” and then continue sinning.

(Sirach 8:9) 
For God is both merciful and angry. His anger will stay with the ungodly.

(Sirach 8:10) 
Don't put off turning back to God, and don't delay from day to day. For his wrath will come suddenly.

(Sirach 8:11) 
Then, when the time comes to face the consequences, you will be destroyed.

(Sirach 8:12) 
Don't trust in ill-gotten money or in great wealth. For they will not help you on the day of God's wrath.

(Sirach 8:13) 
In the day of tribulation and judgment.

(Sirach 8:14) 
Don’t be like a reed blowing in the wind. Don’t go down every path you see. This is what a double-minded sinner does.

(Sirach 8:15) 
For a double-minded man has an unstable heart.

(Sirach 8:16) 
A good heart fears the bad, because it will be tested in the good.

(Sirach 8:17) 
For a good heart always fears, and will not be sad even on joyful days.

(Sirach 8:18) 
The one who fears God will be blessed, and will have a long life.

(Sirach 8:19) 
The end of fearing God is life. And those who find it will live long.

(Sirach 8:20) 
The fear of God is the beginning of his love. Faith is the beginning of clinging to him.

(Sirach 8:21) 
A troubled soul will lose its glory, and eyes clouded by sadness will be troubled.

(Sirach 8:22) 
Do not be hard-hearted, and do not give your soul over to sorrows.

(Sirach 8:23) 
Joy in the heart is the life of a man, and happiness lengthens his days.

(Sirach 8:24) 
Love yourself by caring for your soul, and you will again be comforted in the good things of the righteous.

(Sirach 8:25) 
Those who love themselves, love life, and those who watch out for it will find joy.

(Sirach 8:26) 
Those who control their hands, control their tongues, and those who avoid scandal will be spared the bad.

(Sirach 8:27) 
Speak often, and then wait; and don’t be like a doctor with his tongue.

(Sirach 8:28) 
If you are among important people, act like one of them. And when you become wise, let others seek you out.

(Sirach 8:29) 
Childish actions are like a woman in childbirth, and the mercy of men is available in their days.

(Sirach 8:30) 
A wise man is silent until the right time.

(Sirach 9:1) 
The one who fears God will do good, and the one who perseveres in righteousness will hold fast to it.

(Sirach 9:2) 
And justice will come out to meet him like an honorable mother, or like a virgin's wife.

(Sirach 9:3) 
He will feed on the food of wisdom, and will drink the drink of prudence.

(Sirach 9:4) 
He will not be bent by iniquity, nor will sin have dominion over him.

(Sirach 9:5) 
He will not be found among evil people, and he will not dwell among sinners.

(Sirach 9:6) 
He is turned away by the proud, and in his truth he visits the humble, and he perseveres in the thoughts of the just.

(Sirach 9:7) 
God hates the sacrifices of the wicked, and he detests the vows of evildoers.

(Sirach 9:8) 
And the Lord does not cease until he looks upon the just, and rewards them.

(Sirach 9:9) 
He will not delay to avenge the just, and he will keep the piety of the elect.

(Sirach 9:10) 
Like a shadow of a cloud, the day of the wicked passes; but the just perseveres in time, and on the day of reckoning.

(Sirach 9:11) 
The mouth of wisdom will tell forth wisdom, and the tongue of the just will judge.

(Sirach 9:12) 
A just man will love what is good, and the impious will hate it.

(Sirach 9:13) 
The root of good is the fear of God, and the root of impiety is a lack of understanding.

(Sirach 9:14) 
In the heart of the unwise, folly rests, but the wise rest in their own heart.

(Sirach 9:15) 
In the heart of the prudent, wisdom rests, and the thoughts of man are like the sea.

(Sirach 9:16) 
The proverbs of fools are like a ruined house on the road, and the counsel of the unwise is like a question on the road.

(Sirach 9:17) 
Doctrine to the foolish is like a snare to the feet, and like fetters on the hands.

(Sirach 9:18) 
A fool raises his voice in laughter, but the wise are moderate, as if silent.

(Sirach 9:19) 
The words of the wise are like a mirror in a mirror, but the heart of a fool is like an unfeeling vessel.

(Sirach 9:20) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured vessel; he will not hold any teaching.

(Sirach 9:21) 
A wise man will hear every word of wisdom, and will prove it, and take it to himself.

(Sirach 9:22) 
A fool will not endure, but will mock.

(Sirach 9:23) 
The words of a fool are like a burden on the road; on the lips of the prudent, grace will be found.

(Sirach 9:24) 
The mouth of the prudent is sought in the church, and his words are like precious stones in their hearts.

(Sirach 9:25) 
A fool is like a house on the road, open to all who pass by.

(Sirach 9:26) 
Like dead stones in high places are the words of fools; in the counsel of the wicked they are like a strong rope.

(Sirach 9:27) 
A wise man, in his words, is like a learned man, and the prudent are weighed and measured.

(Sirach 9:28) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured vessel, it will never be able to retain understanding.

(Sirach 9:29) 
The law of the impious is hateful to him, like chains on his feet.

(Sirach 9:30) 
The wise man seeks wisdom, and it is like a cloud of mist to his eyes.

(Sirach 9:31) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured barrel, it will hold no doctrine.

(Sirach 9:32) 
The wise will be silent until the right time.

(Sirach 10:1) 
The wisdom of God speaks to all people, and all who see God's works will declare his greatness.

(Sirach 10:2) 
His great works are full of glory, and his wisdom is hidden from those who don't want it.

(Sirach 10:3) 
Who can tell how the wisdom of God works, and who can fully understand its depths?

(Sirach 10:4) 
Who knows the plan that God is following? Who understands what God is doing?

(Sirach 10:5) 
Who can describe the beauty of God's glory? Who can tell of his magnificent deeds?

(Sirach 10:6) 
What more can we say about the wisdom of God? What can we take away? What more is there to say about all of the wonders of God?

(Sirach 10:7) 
Who can study God's wisdom and fully understand it?

(Sirach 10:8) 
The fear of God is the beginning of glory, of rejoicing, and of the crown of a good life.

(Sirach 10:9) 
The fear of God is the delight of the heart, and will bring joy, happiness, and a long life.

(Sirach 10:10) 
Those who fear God will have a good life, and will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 10:11) 
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; it has been woven into the very fiber of a faithful person.

(Sirach 10:12) 
For the wicked, there is only anger, confusion, and the day of condemnation.

(Sirach 10:13) 
From the beginning, all creation was made to preserve life, and to bring the wicked to destruction.

(Sirach 10:14) 
The words of a person can change the heart, and will burn like a fire.

(Sirach 10:15) 
The ways of the sinful person are full of deceit, and they have no mercy.

(Sirach 10:16) 
Charity and mercy will receive mercy and will watch over each person as they would their own eyes.

(Sirach 10:17) 
Then God will reward everyone according to their deeds and their knowledge.

(Sirach 10:18) 
Do not say, "I will hide from God," and "Who in the heavens will remember me?"

(Sirach 10:19) 
God sees everything; no one can hide from Him.

(Sirach 10:20) 
The works of justice are like fruit-bearing trees, and thoughts of truth are a strong root.

(Sirach 10:21) 
You prepared for it to be in place forever. Justice is honored in the presence of God.

(Sirach 10:22) 
The just man will not go astray.

(Sirach 10:23) 
The just man is always in the sight of God, like the sun shining in God's presence.

(Sirach 10:24) 
God tests the righteous, and puts them to the test.

(Sirach 10:25) 
He tests them like gold in a furnace, and they will be humbled at the time of their testing.

(Sirach 10:26) 
The wicked are like burning coals in a furnace, and they will be consumed on the day of judgment.

(Sirach 10:27) 
But the righteous will shine, and will run like sparks through the reeds.

(Sirach 10:28) 
They will judge the nations, and will rule over the people, and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Sirach 10:29) 
Those who trust in God will understand the truth, and those who remain faithful in love will remain in him, because grace and peace are given to his elect.

(Sirach 11:1) 
A wise man will govern his people, and a wise man's rule will be stable.

(Sirach 11:2) 
As the leader of the people is, so also are his helpers; and as the leader of the city is, so also are those who live within it.

(Sirach 11:3) 
A foolish king will destroy his people, but a city will be well-governed through the wisdom of its leaders.

(Sirach 11:4) 
The earth is in God's hand, and in His time, He will raise up a useful man.

(Sirach 11:5) 
The prosperity of man is in God's hand, and God will bring honor to the face of a wise man.

(Sirach 11:6) 
Do not be angry with your neighbor for every wrong, and do not commit any deed of injustice.

(Sirach 11:7) 
Pride is hateful to God and men, and injustice is hateful to both.

(Sirach 11:8) 
A kingdom is transferred from nation to nation because of injustices, insults, and greed.

(Sirach 11:9) 
Nothing is more proud than man: for all these things are ash and dust.

(Sirach 11:10) 
What is so proud about being ash, when your heart is full of stench?

(Sirach 11:11) 
The doctor’s sickness is incurable: and the one who is king today will die tomorrow.

(Sirach 11:12) 
When a man dies, he will inherit serpents, wild beasts, and worms.

(Sirach 11:13) 
The beginning of man's pride is to turn away from God: because his heart has withdrawn from his Creator.

(Sirach 11:14) 
Because the beginning of all sin is pride: he who embraces it will be filled with a curse, and it will destroy him in the end.

(Sirach 11:15) 
Therefore, God has afflicted the arrogant, and has crushed them even to their foundation.

(Sirach 11:16) 
God has cast out those who were thought to be gods from the earth: and their memory is no more.

(Sirach 11:17) 
Pride was not created with men, nor was wrath created with those who are born of women.

(Sirach 11:18) 
But from the beginning, pride and wrath have existed in those who departed from God.

(Sirach 11:19) 
Sin and wrath are both detestable: he who clings to them will be filled with impiety.

(Sirach 11:20) 
Therefore, God brought tribulations to the arrogant: and He has scattered them to the end.

(Sirach 11:21) 
As fire rages, so does the wrath of the wicked: and as a flame consumes, so does his heart.

(Sirach 11:22) 
How will an angry man act against his Creator? And how will a fool believe in God?

(Sirach 11:23) 
All patience of man is for a short time: and afterwards, the joy of the unfaithful will be changed.

(Sirach 11:24) 
They will suffer for a time, and afterwards, their evils will be thrown back at them.

(Sirach 11:25) 
Their good deeds will be hidden from the sight of men, and in the hearing of the wicked they will be destroyed.

(Sirach 11:26) 
The wicked son does not have strong roots: and the seed of the wicked will not have a foundation.

(Sirach 11:27) 
And if it sprouts in branches, its shoots will not last: and it will be torn down by the wind, and uprooted.

(Sirach 11:28) 
Its fruit is imperfect: and its fruits are useless to eat: and good for nothing.

(Sirach 11:29) 
The altar of the wicked is not in the children, nor in the roots of rottenness.

(Sirach 11:30) 
But the children of the wicked will not multiply: and the generation of the unfaithful will not have a foundation.

(Sirach 11:31) 
The generation of the children of the wicked will be destroyed.

(Sirach 11:32) 
The children of the wicked, like branches, will not have a firm root: and their fruit will be like the wind.

(Sirach 11:33) 
The leaves of the wicked will not flourish: and like dust and the smoke of evils, they will not endure.

(Sirach 11:34) 
He who loves God will remain in wisdom: and His law will illuminate, like light.

(Sirach 12:1) 
If you do good deeds, know who receives them, and the benefit will go to those who deserve it.

(Sirach 12:2) 
Do good for a righteous person, and you will get a great reward. If not from them, certainly from God.

(Sirach 12:3) 
It's not good for the one who insists on doing evil and refuses to give to the poor. He will also be pitied by those to whom he shows no mercy.

(Sirach 12:4) 
Give to the merciful, but don’t receive a sinner. Don’t give hospitality to the wicked.

(Sirach 12:5) 
Do good for the humble, but not for the wicked. Refuse the bread, and don't give it to him, lest he uses it for evil purposes.

(Sirach 12:6) 
Give to the good, but don’t receive a sinner.

(Sirach 12:7) 
Give more to the righteous, and don’t hold back from the wicked.

(Sirach 12:8) 
It is better to give to the just man than to receive. Neither one will be given to the wicked.

(Sirach 12:9) 
Both are equally detestable to God, and the injustice of each is the same.

(Sirach 12:10) 
The righteous will be tested in times of trial, like gold in a furnace.

(Sirach 12:11) 
A sad heart will change one's face, and a wicked heart will contract.

(Sirach 12:12) 
A good heart is joyful, and its thoughts are always in the light.

(Sirach 12:13) 
Don't fear the words of the wicked because his glory will be in the dung.

(Sirach 12:14) 
Flourishing today, he will not be found tomorrow. His dust will return to dust, and his memory will perish.

(Sirach 12:15) 
Keep the commandments, and you will learn how to think. You will not be disturbed by evil.

(Sirach 12:16) 
The heart of the righteous meditates on faith, and justice, and the fear of God.

(Sirach 12:17) 
The heart of sinners meditates on wickedness, in disturbances and offenses.

(Sirach 12:18) 
God illuminates the work of a good man in judgment and finds it in darkness.

(Sirach 12:19) 
It is not good for the wicked to have riches, and the just to be poor.

(Sirach 12:20) 
The righteous person will not be sad about death, but the wicked person hopes for it.

(Sirach 12:21) 
Wisdom is recognized from the speech of the wise, and the mouth of the fool is crushed.

(Sirach 12:22) 
The speech of the wicked is in disturbance, but he will be pierced in joy.

(Sirach 12:23) 
When a man dies, he inherits serpents, wild beasts, and worms.

(Sirach 12:24) 
The beginning of pride in man is to turn away from God. He who departs from his Creator, his heart departs from himself.

(Sirach 12:25) 
Because the beginning of all sin is pride. He who holds onto it will be filled with curses, and it will ruin him in the end.

(Sirach 12:26) 
Therefore, the Lord was grieved by the scourges of the wicked and utterly destroyed them.

(Sirach 12:27) 
The root of pride is the iniquity of man. He who holds it will pour it out like water.

(Sirach 12:28) 
Therefore, God delivered them to destruction and overthrew them in the end.

(Sirach 12:29) 
Like the flow of waters, so was the earth burned by the proud, and their glory perished from them.

(Sirach 12:30) 
Wisdom is a grace to the just, but the sacrifice of sinners is abominable.

(Sirach 13:1) 
Whoever touches pitch will be dirtied by it, and whoever is involved with the proud will share in their pride.

(Sirach 13:2) 
Don't become one of them, and you won't perish.

(Sirach 13:3) 
What's so great about handling clay? And who is kept pure by touching it?

(Sirach 13:4) 
What's so great about someone who is like everyone else? What's glorious about someone who does wrong?

(Sirach 13:5) 
The just will be glorified over the wicked. The proud and the sinner are to be hated.

(Sirach 13:6) 
From the beginning, God created man from the earth and will return him to it again.

(Sirach 13:7) 
The days of mankind are numbered, and their time is brief.

(Sirach 13:8) 
Man is like a vessel formed by a potter, and he will end up in the potter's hands.

(Sirach 13:9) 
Every man is made of the earth, and from the earth he was taken.

(Sirach 13:10) 
Why then be so troubled? There is nothing more troubling than man, who is made of the earth.

(Sirach 13:11) 
Why be proud? What is man but decay and ash?

(Sirach 13:12) 
The doctor is saddened by the length of the sickness, and the king of today will die tomorrow.

(Sirach 13:13) 
Man, why be proud? Why do evil things?

(Sirach 13:14) 
In sickness and destruction is every man; and from the beast and the worm comes the soul of the sinner.

(Sirach 13:15) 
Pride is the beginning of sin; the one who finds it pours out overflowing anger.

(Sirach 13:16) 
Therefore, the Lord brought upon them terrible plagues and destroyed them utterly.

(Sirach 13:17) 
God has thrown down the thrones of the proud and will cast them out.

(Sirach 13:18) 
The root of pride is the hatred of men, and because of sin, it will destroy him.

(Sirach 13:19) 
The proud blasphemed God and cursed Him, and at the end, they suffered in pain.

(Sirach 13:20) 
But for those who fear God, all things are good; and for those who are in His fear, there is peace.

(Sirach 13:21) 
The soul of the fear of God seeks and tests its own righteousness.

(Sirach 13:22) 
He who fears God will prepare his heart and sanctify his soul in the sight of God.

(Sirach 13:23) 
He who fears God observes His commandments, and he will prepare patience in his fear.

(Sirach 13:24) 
He who fears God seeks his will, and those who love Him will fulfill it.

(Sirach 13:25) 
He who fears God prepares his heart, and he is humbled in His sight.

(Sirach 13:26) 
Let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of men, because His mercy is great.

(Sirach 14:1) 
The one who reveres God will do good works, and through doing those works, he will be forgiven for his sins.

(Sirach 14:2) 
The one who has self-control will endure with patience. In those who may sin, joy will remain.

(Sirach 14:3) 
The heart of the self-controlled man will consider good things and won't be corrupted in the judgment.

(Sirach 14:4) 
Happy is the man who perseveres in good things, and not in evil.

(Sirach 14:5) 
A bad man is not found in the temptations that beset good men, and wisdom is not pleasing to a sinful man.

(Sirach 14:6) 
The wise man is in the word of wisdom, and the just man stands firm like the sun.

(Sirach 14:7) 
The counsel of an evil heart is a heavy burden, and his mind exasperates those around him.

(Sirach 14:8) 
Wickedness is accepted by the wicked man, and he is not cleansed, because God has taken away his fear.

(Sirach 14:9) 
The wise heart is understood in the words of wisdom, and as night in day, so is a foolish man in understanding.

(Sirach 14:10) 
You shall not grieve the heart of a just man, because he judges, and does not hate a sinful man.

(Sirach 14:11) 
Turn your soul away from sin, and correct iniquity a little.

(Sirach 14:12) 
Give alms from your possessions, and do not turn your face away from the poor.

(Sirach 14:13) 
Turn away your face from the poor, and he will not turn away his eyes from you.

(Sirach 14:14) 
In banquets, let your table be with you, and whatever is prepared, be first.

(Sirach 14:15) 
Be like a learned man who grabs what is prepared, and because of this, do not eat too much.

(Sirach 14:16) 
If you are plentiful, do not be greedy, and if you are in the midst of those who are not, do not be imprudent.

(Sirach 14:17) 
Moderation is good in fullness, and sleeplessness causes sorrow.

(Sirach 14:18) 
Sleep is quiet in a cold land, and the mediocre man will eat and be satisfied.

(Sirach 14:19) 
The wise man has heeded the words of wisdom, and has approved them, and the one who is sensible praises them.

(Sirach 14:20) 
The wise man and the one who has learned in the doctrine of wisdom will encounter wisdom, but the one who is foolish does not remain in it.

(Sirach 14:21) 
The understanding of the fool is like the wheel of a chariot, and is like a strong impulse in judgement.

(Sirach 14:22) 
Son, do not work too much, and if you want to multiply yourself, you will not be just.

(Sirach 14:23) 
If you are great, you will be humbled in yourself, and before God, you will find grace.

(Sirach 14:24) 
Search in secret, and you will find, and in the things that you seek, you will be filled.

(Sirach 14:25) 
For you do not need many labors if you have searched.

(Sirach 14:26) 
For many have been deceived in their own opinion, and an evil suspicion turns them away.

(Sirach 14:27) 
A hard heart has not succeeded, and the one who has despised it will be entangled in evil.

(Sirach 14:28) 
The one who perseveres in evil will accumulate sins.

(Sirach 14:29) 
Abstain from desires and do not do your own will, and abstain from pleasures.

(Sirach 14:30) 
If you give your soul to desires, it will make you a joy to your enemies.

(Sirach 14:31) 
Do not abound in delights and do not be joined to them.

(Sirach 14:32) 
Do not become poor from banquets with little expense.

(Sirach 15:1) 
Fear God, and you will do what He commands. Whoever loves God, will maintain his ways.

(Sirach 15:2) 
Those who have faith in God, will have eternal life. Those who love Him, will receive mercy.

(Sirach 15:3) 
To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The Lord will be with those who are faithful.

(Sirach 15:4) 
Wisdom and discipline are in the understanding of the righteous. The eye of the Lord is upon those who love Him.

(Sirach 15:5) 
Whoever fears God will do good, and those who are self-controlled will have the mercy of God.

(Sirach 15:6) 
Those who fear God will prepare their heart and soul before Him with humility.

(Sirach 15:7) 
Wisdom, truth, and the knowledge of the Law are in the hands of God. All the works of the Lord are done with faith.

(Sirach 15:8) 
Knowledge and understanding of the fear of God, is keeping His commandments.

(Sirach 15:9) 
God will not receive the sinner or regard the proud, for God is the judge of all.

(Sirach 15:10) 
God does not show favoritism, nor does he disregard the prayer of the poor.

(Sirach 15:11) 
He hears the prayer of the oppressed and will bring judgement on their oppressors.

(Sirach 15:12) 
God will not get tired of the prayers of the orphan or the widow when they pour out their complaints.

(Sirach 15:13) 
Do not the tears of the widow fall on the cheek, and does her cry fall on the one who caused them?

(Sirach 15:14) 
Whoever serves God will be received with kindness, and his prayer will reach to the clouds.

(Sirach 15:15) 
The prayer of the humble will pierce the clouds, and it will not depart until God has considered it.

(Sirach 15:16) 
It will not depart until the Most High has looked upon it, and will bring righteous judgment, and will consider it.

(Sirach 15:17) 
And it will not delay until He has finished the judgment.

(Sirach 15:18) 
Cursed is he who rejects God, whose heart is greedy, and those who blaspheme will not be justified.

(Sirach 15:19) 
Those who abound in evils, will be reserved for evil, and their sins will not be hidden.

(Sirach 15:20) 
The deliverance of those who fear God, and the hope of those who know Him.

(Sirach 15:21) 
Whoever fears the Lord will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, because He Himself is their hope.

(Sirach 15:22) 
To fear the Lord is life, and those who have it, will rest in the night.

(Sirach 15:23) 
The fear of the Lord is the desired crown of rejoicing, making joy and the day of exultation.

(Sirach 15:24) 
To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom, and its branches are of long life.

(Sirach 15:25) 
To fear the Lord drives away sins. Whoever has it, will turn away from all anger.

(Sirach 15:26) 
He who is without fear will not be justified, for the anger of his disturbance will destroy him.

(Sirach 15:27) 
He who is patient will sustain until the end, and after that, joy will be given to him.

(Sirach 15:28) 
It is good to hide iniquity, and those who have good grace will recount the just deeds.

(Sirach 15:29) 
It is good to control the tongue and to not have been experienced in grief.

(Sirach 16:1) 
All wisdom comes from the Lord God. God has had wisdom always, and for all time before the world began.

(Sirach 16:2) 
Who can count the sand of the sea, the raindrops, or the days of eternity?

(Sirach 16:3) 
Who can understand the height of the sky, the width of the earth, or the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 16:4) 
Wisdom was created before all things, and prudence has existed eternally.

(Sirach 16:5) 
The word of God in the highest heavens is the source of wisdom, and His paths are the eternal commandments.

(Sirach 16:6) 
To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? Who has known His knowledge?

(Sirach 16:7) 
There is only one Most High, the almighty Creator, a powerful king, greatly to be feared, sitting on His throne, and ruling.

(Sirach 16:8) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit. He saw, numbered, and measured wisdom.

(Sirach 16:9) 
And He poured out wisdom on all His works, and on all mankind, according to His gift. He gave wisdom to those who love Him.

(Sirach 16:10) 
Fear of the Lord is glory, boasting, joy, and a crown of exultation.

(Sirach 16:11) 
Fear of the Lord delights the heart and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 16:12) 
It will be well for those who fear God in their final days, and they will be blessed on the day of their completion.

(Sirach 16:13) 
The beginning of the fear of God is justification, and it exists with the faithful from birth.

(Sirach 16:14) 
Wisdom is the treasure of knowledge and of the works of the just, but the sacrifice of the wicked is abominable to God.

(Sirach 16:15) 
The offering of unjust gifts is defiled, and the sins of the wicked are not pleasing.

(Sirach 16:16) 
The Lord is the judge and does not accept persons.

(Sirach 16:17) 
He does not accept anyone against the poor, and He will hear the prayer of the injured.

(Sirach 16:18) 
Do not despise the groaning of the poor, and do not be annoyed by the prayers of the widow.

(Sirach 16:19) 
The tears of a widow fall on her cheeks, and she cries out against him who caused them.

(Sirach 16:20) 
He who serves God is acceptable, and his prayer reaches even to the clouds.

(Sirach 16:21) 
A humble prayer passes through the clouds until it arrives, and it will not depart until the Most High looks upon it,

(Sirach 16:22) 
and He will judge the just and will perform judgment and hear it.

(Sirach 16:23) 
And He will not delay, nor will He endure until He has completed it.

(Sirach 16:24) 
For the Lord is the judge, and there is no favoritism in judgment.

(Sirach 16:25) 
He will not accept anyone against the poor, because He hears the prayer of the oppressed.

(Sirach 16:26) 
And He will not despise the supplication of the orphan, nor will He be saddened by the groaning of the widow.

(Sirach 16:27) 
Do not the widow’s cheeks flow with tears, and her cries against him who caused them?

(Sirach 16:28) 
For he who serves God will be received kindly, and his requests will be placated even to the clouds.

(Sirach 16:29) 
A humble prayer passes through regions, until it arrives, and it will not depart until the Most High looks upon it,

(Sirach 16:30) 
and He will judge the just, and He will perform judgment, and He will bring forth judgment.

(Sirach 17:1) 
The Lord fashioned man out of the earth, and made him according to His own image.

(Sirach 17:2) 
He gave man dominion over himself, over his mind, and over his body.

(Sirach 17:3) 
God made man to be awestruck before Him, and gave man a duty to love and serve God.

(Sirach 17:4) 
Man was made so that he might come to know God's infinite greatness.

(Sirach 17:5) 
He filled man's eyes with understanding, so that man could see God's plan, and he showed him the knowledge of understanding.

(Sirach 17:6) 
He gave man knowledge of his mind, and showed him His glory.

(Sirach 17:7) 
He put understanding into man's eyes, and showed him the greatness of His works.

(Sirach 17:8) 
And He made their works glorious forever.

(Sirach 17:9) 
He made an eternal covenant with them, and showed them His justice.

(Sirach 17:10) 
His mercy is upon all flesh.

(Sirach 17:11) 
He pours out His mercy over all the earth.

(Sirach 17:12) 
God sent man on a mission, and he was given dominion over all things.

(Sirach 17:13) 
And He gave man power over his own soul.

(Sirach 17:14) 
He gave man the duty to love God with fear and trembling.

(Sirach 17:15) 
He gave man the duty to love his neighbor, and to understand his own sin.

(Sirach 17:16) 
The generations of men are like the green leaves, and the leaves of a tree, which fall off, and another falls.

(Sirach 17:17) 
Thus also is the generation of flesh and blood. One man is born from a woman, another man dies.

(Sirach 17:18) 
Every work of man is corrupted, and their works follow them.

(Sirach 17:19) 
And it is like the work of a potter.

(Sirach 17:20) 
So also the just and the wicked.

(Sirach 17:21) 
What is above the sun? And what is above the light? And what is above life? And what is above death?

(Sirach 17:22) 
All these things come from the earth.

(Sirach 17:23) 
For the earth was created out of the earth, and the just man comes from the wicked.

(Sirach 17:24) 
But all things shall be blessed in the Lord.

(Sirach 17:25) 
The days of man's life are numbered, but the days of Israel are without number.

(Sirach 17:26) 
For who will declare the great things of God? And who will announce His works?

(Sirach 17:27) 
For who can measure His greatness?

(Sirach 17:28) 
What is more precious than gold? For all things that are made of gold are good.

(Sirach 17:29) 
And what is sweeter than honey? And what is better than honey?

(Sirach 17:30) 
But wisdom and discipline are better than gold.

(Sirach 17:31) 
And as wisdom and doctrine direct life, so also is the mercy of God upon the just man.

(Sirach 17:32) 
He who gives doctrine gives also glory.

(Sirach 17:33) 
Keep justice, and preserve yourself, and you shall be justified.

(Sirach 17:34) 
And keep your faith, and you shall remain.

(Sirach 18:1) 
The one who reverences God will act well. The one who holds onto justice will fully understand it, and will be embraced by it as if it were his mother.

(Sirach 18:2) 
He will be nourished by the food of justice, and drink from the waters of life.

(Sirach 18:3) 
In the fear of the Lord is knowledge and discipline. Those who act accordingly will receive an inheritance with the just.

(Sirach 18:4) 
Do not desire the works of the wicked, but instead love the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 18:5) 
Do not be distressed, and do not be afraid. Do not associate with those people.

(Sirach 18:6) 
Love God with your whole heart, and whoever clings to Him will become like Him.

(Sirach 18:7) 
The reverence of the Lord is an honor, glory, joy, and a crown of exultation.

(Sirach 18:8) 
If you choose the fear of God, you will be delighted in them. Those who love Him will be sanctified in life.

(Sirach 18:9) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 18:10) 
Those who fear the Lord keep His commandments and will be patient in Him.

(Sirach 18:11) 
They will say, "We will prepare our hearts and sanctify ourselves, because after this, we will be justified."

(Sirach 18:12) 
Those who fear the Lord will find mercy and will be justified in judgment.

(Sirach 18:13) 
Those who fear the Lord will hope in Him, and those who love Him will remain in Him.

(Sirach 18:14) 
Those who fear the Lord will seek what pleases Him. Those who love Him will fulfill His laws.

(Sirach 18:15) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in the sight of the Most High.

(Sirach 18:16) 
Those who fear the Lord will obey His commandments and will have patience. Those who trust in Him will not fail.

(Sirach 18:17) 
Woe to the double-hearted, to impure lips, to hands that do evil, and to the sinner walking on two paths.

(Sirach 18:18) 
Woe to the timid heart, because it does not believe and therefore will not be protected.

(Sirach 18:19) 
Woe to the one who loses patience, turns away from the right paths, and ascends the perverse ways.

(Sirach 18:20) 
What will those who fear God do? Those who keep His laws will have life in them.

(Sirach 18:21) 
Those who fear Him will prepare their hearts and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 18:22) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and in judgment, God will visit them.

(Sirach 19:1) 
Whoever scorns small things will fall little by little.

(Sirach 19:2) 
A judge who understands justice will take away the glory of the wicked and will turn away from the evildoers, thus judging them.

(Sirach 19:3) 
Fire and a violent wind are the agents of destruction, as is famine.

(Sirach 19:4) 
It is better to fall into the hands of the wicked, not into their deceits, for their deceit is more dangerous than their malice.

(Sirach 19:5) 
Every human being is like grass, and their glory is like the flowers of the field.

(Sirach 19:6) 
They wither and fall like grass, and the flower falls from the stem.

(Sirach 19:7) 
Do not make promises before you are judged, and do not speak before you have understood.

(Sirach 19:8) 
Do not answer a wicked person according to their wickedness, lest you become like them.

(Sirach 19:9) 
Speak well to the good, so that you will not be reproached for your words.

(Sirach 19:10) 
Do not say, “I will take vengeance on the wicked.” Instead, trust in the Lord, and He will help you.

(Sirach 19:11) 
Do good to your neighbor, and remember to fear the Lord.

(Sirach 19:12) 
Remember your death and cease from wickedness. Remember the commandments, and do not be puffed up in malice.

(Sirach 19:13) 
Whoever humbles themselves will be found wise, and whoever hides evil will conceal iniquity.

(Sirach 19:14) 
Whoever is silent will be honored with wisdom.

(Sirach 19:15) 
Fire tests gold and silver, and people are tested in the furnace of humility.

(Sirach 19:16) 
Trust in God, and He will help you; direct your way and hope in Him.

(Sirach 19:17) 
Whoever fears God will not tremble or be afraid, because God is their hope.

(Sirach 19:18) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 19:19) 
Whoever seeks the fear of God will obtain prudence, and whoever looks to Him will find a blessing.

(Sirach 19:20) 
Whoever fears God will be blessed in the end, and will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 19:21) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of God, and through that, they will be justified with the saints.

(Sirach 19:22) 
Whoever fears God will receive honor; they will be honored in the sight of men and in the sight of God Himself.

(Sirach 19:23) 
Whoever fears God will persevere in His will and, with patience, will be like a mother.

(Sirach 19:24) 
Whoever fears God loves Him, and whoever loves Him will be glorified.

(Sirach 19:25) 
The Spirit of the fear of God created all things, and all things were created for the sake of fear.

(Sirach 19:26) 
Blessed is the one who fears God and keeps His ways.

(Sirach 19:27) 
Because God, looking upon those who fear Him, will bless them.

(Sirach 19:28) 
God will bless and visit the soul that fears Him and will receive it on the day of its death.

(Sirach 19:29) 
The fear of God is the beginning of His love, and faith is the beginning of clinging to Him.

(Sirach 19:30) 
They hold discipline, protection, and patience within themselves, and those who do not have these are forsaken.

(Sirach 19:31) 
The life of sinners is short, and the wicked will quickly be taken away.

(Sirach 19:32) 
Whoever is afflicted hastens to evil, and whoever is joyful in heart hastens to evil.

(Sirach 19:33) 
The abominations of the heart, the unrest, and the anger of a wicked man are all abominations.

(Sirach 19:34) 
A just man endures until the appointed time, and at the end, he will have joy.

(Sirach 19:35) 
A good man hides evil, and the enemy of the hateful will uncover his ways.

(Sirach 19:36) 
In the understanding of a prudent man, the words of wisdom are known, and the righteous will receive them.

(Sirach 19:37) 
The words of wisdom are like rivers of water; the source of justice is everlasting.

(Sirach 19:38) 
A fool, like a ship tossed about by the waves, does not know how to steer.

(Sirach 19:39) 
The wise man, like a good helmsman, meditates on the fear of the Lord, directs his steps, and is always in His law.

(Sirach 19:40) 
Every human being upon the earth is as they were created, just a human.

(Sirach 20:1) 
Those who are studious of the law of the Most High will acquire it, and those who act by it will be glorified.

(Sirach 20:2) 
Those who are taught by the law will find something to respond with; those who act by it will find the words they need to respond.

(Sirach 20:3) 
Those who love the law love life, and those who rise early to learn it will be filled with joy.

(Sirach 20:4) 
Those who hold fast to the law will inherit it; whoever passes through it will inherit eternal life.

(Sirach 20:5) 
Those who turn toward the law will dwell in it, and those who love it will walk in its ways.

(Sirach 20:6) 
Those who believe in the law will inherit it; those who trust in it will possess it.

(Sirach 20:7) 
Evil begins when you are separated from the law; those who withdraw from God will hate it.

(Sirach 20:8) 
The thoughts of wicked people are like the wind or like a ship passing through waves.

(Sirach 20:9) 
Like a ship's path through water, they pass by, and their path is not found, nor is there any sign of their passing in the waves.

(Sirach 20:10) 
So too, the wicked person will not be found when they die. They will be turned to nothing and scattered like dust.

(Sirach 20:11) 
Their memory is erased, and their life passes like a cloud, like a mist scattered by the sun.

(Sirach 20:12) 
Those who abandon the law and do not know it fall into evil; those who hold to it are loved by God.

(Sirach 20:13) 
Wisdom meets them like a mother, and receives them like a young wife.

(Sirach 20:14) 
Wisdom feeds them with the bread of understanding and gives them to drink from the waters of wisdom.

(Sirach 20:15) 
Wisdom establishes and strengthens them, so they will not be shaken. It confirms them.

(Sirach 20:16) 
Then Wisdom tests them and finds them worthy.

(Sirach 20:17) 
Like fire refining gold, Wisdom tests them, and examines them in the vessel of temptation.

(Sirach 20:18) 
Until a set time, they will be established and proven like gold in a furnace.

(Sirach 20:19) 
In the time of their visitation, they will shine and will run like sparks through the reeds.

(Sirach 20:20) 
They will judge the nations and rule the peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Sirach 21:1) 
My son, if you want to serve God, prepare yourself for the trials that come with it.

(Sirach 21:2) 
Keep your heart on the right path, be steady in your faith, and do not be in a hurry when trouble comes.

(Sirach 21:3) 
Cling to Him, and do not leave, so that you may grow at the end.

(Sirach 21:4) 
Accept everything that comes to you, and endure it in sorrow. Be patient in your humility.

(Sirach 21:5) 
Because gold is tested in fire, and righteous men are tested in the furnace of suffering.

(Sirach 21:6) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you. Make straight your ways, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 21:7) 
He who fears God will not tremble or be afraid, because God is his hope.

(Sirach 21:8) 
Blessed is the soul of the one who fears God.

(Sirach 21:9) 
All of this comes from fearing God. And who clings to it, with whom will he be glorified?

(Sirach 21:10) 
All flesh will choose the fear of God and the keeping of the commandments.

(Sirach 21:11) 
The Lord's commandments are good, and they make the heart rejoice, and they enlighten the eyes.

(Sirach 21:12) 
The fear of the Lord sanctifies the heart, and gives joy, and gladness, and a long life.

(Sirach 21:13) 
He who fears God will be well in the end, and will be blessed on the day of his death.

(Sirach 21:14) 
The beginning of the fear of God is to fear God. And when it is established in faith, he will be magnified in glory.

(Sirach 21:15) 
From the fear of God, all iniquity will depart.

(Sirach 21:16) 
He who does not fear God cannot be justified, for the wrath of his heart will destroy him.

(Sirach 21:17) 
Patience in time will console you, and again will bring joy to him.

(Sirach 21:18) 
His thoughts are like the vessels of a potter. In due time, He will visit them.

(Sirach 21:19) 
He who fears God will never be sad.

(Sirach 21:20) 
He who hopes in God will not be ashamed.

(Sirach 21:21) 
A good spirit in poverty is better than gold.

(Sirach 21:22) 
It is better to live with a foolish man, than to live with a quarrelsome woman.

(Sirach 21:23) 
The impious man does his own will in his days, but the chosen one will endure until the end.

(Sirach 21:24) 
A prudent heart will know the time and judgment. Both in the matters of sinners and in their faults.

(Sirach 21:25) 
Every way will be far from the wicked, but the just man knows the way.

(Sirach 21:26) 
He who loves justice, loves life, and he who hates reproof is foolish.

(Sirach 22:1) 
The one who reveres God will do good things, and the one who holds fast to what is right will obtain goodness.

(Sirach 22:2) 
The one who knows goodness keeps it safe. And the one who loves goodness will have life.

(Sirach 22:3) 
The one who holds fast to goodness will inherit it, and the one who rejects goodness will perish.

(Sirach 22:4) 
Reverence for the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and it is made firm with the faithful in their mother's womb.

(Sirach 22:5) 
Wisdom strengthens faith with all people, and the good will be compared with the elect and the righteous.

(Sirach 22:6) 
The one who reveres God will have what is good, and his hope is like good fruit.

(Sirach 22:7) 
The one who reveres God will do well, and his deeds will be compared with his state.

(Sirach 22:8) 
God will bring justice to those who revere Him, and He will visit them in His sight.

(Sirach 22:9) 
The one who reveres the Lord prepares his heart and sanctifies his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 22:10) 
The one who reveres the Lord keeps His commandments and will have patience until He is seen.

(Sirach 22:11) 
Saying, "If you do not believe, go away from Me." And for the one who boasts in Him, it is made clear to him.

(Sirach 22:12) 
The one who reveres the Lord reveres friendship, because the friend is like him.

(Sirach 22:13) 
Son, revere God with all your soul, and love His priests.

(Sirach 22:14) 
Love Him with all your strength, and do not abandon His ministers.

(Sirach 22:15) 
Seek the reverence of God and live in righteousness, and you will obtain it, and be crowned on the day of His visitation.

(Sirach 22:16) 
Everyone who reveres God hopes in Him, and the one who holds to Him will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 22:17) 
The one who reveres God will fear nothing, and he will not be afraid, for He is his hope.

(Sirach 22:18) 
Blessed is the soul that reveres God.

(Sirach 22:19) 
For to whom? And whose is the glory? And who is glorious? The one who reveres God.

(Sirach 22:20) 
Reverence for the Lord is the beginning of His love, and faith is the beginning of adhering to Him.

(Sirach 22:21) 
Seek contrition of heart and humility, and He will be merciful to you in the day of tribulation.

(Sirach 22:22) 
The one who reveres the Lord will do good things, and the one who holds fast to what is right will hear his prayers.

(Sirach 22:23) 
Just as water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 22:24) 
The merciful will make atonement for sins.

(Sirach 22:25) 
Do not be afraid to die for the truth, and God will fight for you.

(Sirach 22:26) 
Do not be quick with your tongue, and do not be negligent and careless in your works.

(Sirach 22:27) 
Do not be like a lion in your house, overturning your household and terrifying them.

(Sirach 22:28) 
Do not let your hand be extended to receive, and contract it when giving.

(Sirach 23:1) 
Lord, Father, and Master of my life, don't let me be corrupted by the plans of other men.

(Sirach 23:2) 
Don't give me the pride of life in my eyes, and don't let my desires control me. Turn my face away from worldly desires.

(Sirach 23:3) 
Don't let me be consumed by the lusts of the flesh, the pleasures of the world, or the desires of the tongue.

(Sirach 23:4) 
Keep evil far from me. Protect me from lies. Give me neither poverty nor wealth: give me only the necessities, lest, if I have too much, I become a wicked man.

(Sirach 23:5) 
If I am full, I may forget you and say, "Who is the Lord?" Or, if I am forced by poverty, I may steal and ruin the name of my God.

(Sirach 23:6) 
Don’t reveal the crimes of a servant to his master, because the servant is aware of his own crimes.

(Sirach 23:7) 
Because a wicked servant hates his master, and this hatred is within him.

(Sirach 23:8) 
I would rather be the servant of a good master than a bad master, and I should not hate what is good.

(Sirach 23:9) 
From my youth I have learned, and even now I seek truth.

(Sirach 23:10) 
I have reached the fulfillment through truth, and my heart takes delight in it.

(Sirach 23:11) 
I sought truth from the beginning, and I have found it through its manifestation.

(Sirach 23:12) 
I have sought truth through labor, and in my works I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:13) 
My hands labored for truth, and I have seen many good things through it.

(Sirach 23:14) 
My tongue has confessed the truth, and the glory of the truth is that it is manifest.

(Sirach 23:15) 
I am still young, and before I depart this life, I have sought truth openly.

(Sirach 23:16) 
I continue to seek truth, and I will not tire until I find it.

(Sirach 23:17) 
My heart has been saddened, and in my confusion I have studied it.

(Sirach 23:18) 
I have opened my hand to truth, and I have been blessed by it, because I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:19) 
I have laid down my soul in truth, and I have guarded it with knowledge.

(Sirach 23:20) 
I received peace of heart with truth, and I have lived with it.

(Sirach 23:21) 
The Lord has exalted me, and because of this I will glorify truth.

(Sirach 23:22) 
After my confusion, truth has given me a good reward.

(Sirach 23:23) 
My heart has drawn near to truth: and I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:24) 
May God give me my reward.

(Sirach 23:25) 
Give, and you will receive.

(Sirach 23:26) 
Love your neighbor, and do not trust your enemy.

(Sirach 24:1) 
The wisdom of God raises up those who are humble, and delivers them from the evils of the world.

(Sirach 24:2) 
My heart is made firm in the Lord, and I speak with honor in His presence.

(Sirach 24:3) 
Great are the works of the Lord, all of which are sought after by those who love Him.

(Sirach 24:4) 
Those who love God will love Him; and those who love Him will seek His will.

(Sirach 24:5) 
He who believes in Him will inherit life, and the just will possess it.

(Sirach 24:6) 
Prepare your heart, and consider His ways.

(Sirach 24:7) 
For those who do His works, will be saved.

(Sirach 24:8) 
He who loves the Lord loves His Son, and whoever obeys Him will love Him.

(Sirach 24:9) 
For this, I will visit all nations, and each one according to his works.

(Sirach 24:10) 
For as He commanded me to do, so it has been done.

(Sirach 24:11) 
I came forth like a river from a river, and like a great wave near the sea.

(Sirach 24:12) 
Therefore, I will still pour out doctrine like flowing water, and I will reveal it like a mirror, and like an image.

(Sirach 24:13) 
I will say: I will teach doctrine still in the morning, and I will illuminate it until the light.

(Sirach 24:14) 
I will pour out doctrine like a fortification of water, like prophecy, and like an eternal testament.

(Sirach 24:15) 
The gentiles will see still and they will know that those who are in need of God will not be lacking.

(Sirach 24:16) 
The Lord is great, and exalted, and His power is forever.

(Sirach 24:17) 
It is not amazing to work in His works, and who will investigate His works?

(Sirach 24:18) 
Who will recount the strength of His glory, and who will dare to speak of His marvelous works?

(Sirach 24:19) 
Wisdom precedes all of these things and His understanding is from eternity.

(Sirach 24:20) 
The root of wisdom—to whom has it been revealed? And who has known His prudence?

(Sirach 24:21) 
There is only one Most High, the omnipotent Creator, the powerful king, and greatly feared, who sits upon His throne, and reigns.

(Sirach 24:22) 
The Creator created her in the Holy Spirit, and saw her, and numbered, and measured her.

(Sirach 24:23) 
And He poured her out over all His works, and over all flesh according to His gift, and especially over those who love Him.

(Sirach 24:24) 
The fear of the Lord is glory, and boasting, and joy, and the crown of exultation. The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives joy, and gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 24:25) 
It is good for those who fear God, both in the end times, and in the day of their death they will be blessed.

(Sirach 24:26) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the election of wisdom and with the holy faithful it will be born with fear.

(Sirach 24:27) 
The fear of God is the fullness of wisdom, and fills its fruits.

(Sirach 24:28) 
It will fill His entire house with good things, and His treasures with fruits.

(Sirach 24:29) 
The crown of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; filling peace and the fruit of salvation.

(Sirach 24:30) 
Both God sent, knowledge and understanding of glory, and exalts the glory of those who hold to it.

(Sirach 24:31) 
The root of wisdom is fearing God; and its branches are life.

(Sirach 24:32) 
The treasure of wisdom is fearing God.

(Sirach 24:33) 
Wisdom and the discipline of justice, and love, are guardians.

(Sirach 24:34) 
The works of His commandments are life, and in His faith, like light.

(Sirach 24:35) 
There is no lie in it, but its faith remains forever.

(Sirach 24:36) 
Lies and vanity are for foolish men; but wisdom, like a river in its fullness, is for the prudent, and remains like a testament in them.

(Sirach 24:37) 
The gentiles did not believe in it, and did not know its ways, nor did they hear it.

(Sirach 24:38) 
But they who fear God have known it.

(Sirach 24:39) 
For that is life, and is found in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 24:40) 
And its beginning is to please God, and its love is the keeping of His laws.

(Sirach 24:41) 
The discipline of His commandments is the love of life: and His works are love.

(Sirach 24:42) 
So that we may rejoice in the things that we do, and walk with fear of Him, and walk in His ways.

(Sirach 25:1) 
The person who has reverence for God will do good things, and anyone who clings to justice will grasp it, and it will fill them completely like a vessel.

(Sirach 25:2) 
And it will greet them like a mother greets her children, embracing them as a wife embraces her husband.

(Sirach 25:3) 
It will feed them with the bread of life and understanding, and will give them to drink of the life-giving water of wisdom.

(Sirach 25:4) 
They will be strengthened by justice and will not be shaken, they will trust in it, and they will not be humiliated.

(Sirach 25:5) 
It will exalt them above their neighbor, and in the midst of the assembly, it will open their mouth.

(Sirach 25:6) 
Joy, a crown, and honor will be given to them forever.

(Sirach 25:7) 
But the wicked will not receive wisdom, nor will they remain in it, and they will not be able to grasp it.

(Sirach 25:8) 
For they are like a stone, a test to them: and they will stumble over that stone, and it will cast them away.

(Sirach 25:9) 
For wisdom is like a name to them; and they have not known it.

(Sirach 25:10) 
For it is better not to know wisdom than to know it and not to recognize its power.

(Sirach 25:11) 
For it is better for a person who does not know wisdom to walk along the road, than to know it and turn away from the road.

(Sirach 25:12) 
What is iniquity, except the death of sinners? Or what is evil, but to turn away from God?

(Sirach 25:13) 
For what creature on earth is better than a human being? Or what is a greater sense within a human being?

(Sirach 25:14) 
All flesh grows old like a garment: for the days of the world are the days of the good.

(Sirach 25:15) 
Like leaves in the springtime: some fall, others come forth. So also generations of flesh and blood, one dies, and another is born.

(Sirach 25:16) 
Every corruptible work will have an end, and the person who does that work will go with it.

(Sirach 25:17) 
For it is good above all things to love God: for whoever loves Him will have life.

(Sirach 25:18) 
Whoever fears God will consider all things, and will remain in patience.

(Sirach 25:19) 
Every temptation and tribulation will come upon them.

(Sirach 25:20) 
And whoever fears God will keep the commandments, and will direct the paths of their heart.

(Sirach 25:21) 
They will believe in his word, and will trust in him as in a father.

(Sirach 25:22) 
All fear of the Lord is fear, and in all justice there is wisdom.

(Sirach 25:23) 
But the one who does not fear God cannot be justified, because his wrath is his disturbance.

(Sirach 25:24) 
All mercy will make a place for each person according to the merits of their works.

(Sirach 25:25) 
The person who offers a sacrifice from iniquity, defiles the sacrifice: and the gifts of the unjust are not approved.

(Sirach 25:26) 
The Most High does not look at the gifts of the wicked, nor will He be propitiated for sins in the multitude of their sacrifices.

(Sirach 25:27) 
The person who offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who slaughters a son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 25:28) 
The bread of the needy is the life of the poor: the one who defrauds them is a person of blood.

(Sirach 25:29) 
The one who takes away the life of their neighbor kills them: and the one who defrauds a hired worker is a person of blood.

(Sirach 25:30) 
The wicked build and then destroy: and when they plant, they uproot.

(Sirach 25:31) 
The giver and the receiver look upon their labor.

(Sirach 25:32) 
What is the use of humility to the one who fasts and does not fulfill the commands of God?

(Sirach 25:33) 
What is the use if the person prays and does not keep the commandments?

(Sirach 26:1) 
Whoever reveres God will do good deeds. And the one who endures in justice will understand it and be enlightened like light.

(Sirach 26:2) 
Whoever reveres God will have good things and a good reputation, just like pleasing incense.

(Sirach 26:3) 
Whoever reveres God will be well-regarded and will honor his parents, like a mother.

(Sirach 26:4) 
In reverence of God is his life and hope, and it will never pass away.

(Sirach 26:5) 
Whoever reveres God will have no fear, nor will he be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 26:6) 
Blessed is the soul of the one who reveres God.

(Sirach 26:7) 
For in the visitation of God, he will be saved.

(Sirach 26:8) 
Whoever reveres God hopes in Him, and the just will not be lacking in His hope.

(Sirach 26:9) 
Whoever reveres God hates sins, and the one who commits injustice will atone for his sins.

(Sirach 26:10) 
A wicked man does not persevere in his wicked desires.

(Sirach 26:11) 
Because God finds wickedness hateful, wickedness will not be hidden from Him.

(Sirach 26:12) 
But a just man will do good works and will fulfill the commandments of God.

(Sirach 26:13) 
And he will know that God is his, and he will remain in His counsel and reverence.

(Sirach 26:14) 
Whoever reveres God prepares his heart and humbles his soul in the sight of God.

(Sirach 26:15) 
We fall into the hands of God and not into the hands of men.

(Sirach 26:16) 
For according to His greatness is also His mercy; because as He is magnified, so also is His mercy.

(Sirach 26:17) 
Not everything belongs to men, but the mercy of God belongs to all things.

(Sirach 26:18) 
It is good to show mercy in the time of tribulation, like clouds of rain in the time of drought.

(Sirach 26:19) 
He who gives, offering in justice, will remember his sacrifice, and his glory will flourish.

(Sirach 26:20) 
For there is no better offering than mercy and almsgiving.

(Sirach 26:21) 
Mercy and almsgiving forgive sins.

(Sirach 26:22) 
He will turn away from iniquity, and God will turn away because of iniquity.

(Sirach 26:23) 
He will not judge the person of the poor, and he will hear the prayers of those in distress.

(Sirach 26:24) 
He will prepare his heart in God and his prayers as if building with stones.

(Sirach 26:25) 
A fool is like a craftsman who cuts useless things, and so too is the one who is foolish like a man who scatters.

(Sirach 26:26) 
A son who sins but has sense is better than a son of the just who has custom.

(Sirach 26:27) 
A wise man and a knowing heart are better than a foolish man and a fool.

(Sirach 26:28) 
One who is moderate and has sense is better than one who seeks greatness and lacks it.

(Sirach 26:29) 
In all your work, consider your last things, and you will not sin for eternity.

(Sirach 26:30) 
Do not err in your substance, and do not go on the ways in which you sin.

(Sirach 27:1) 
Those who love mercy, love God, and those who hold it, will be filled with grace.

(Sirach 27:2) 
Those who love fear, will be great, and those who keep it, will be like the very roots of a tree.

(Sirach 27:3) 
Fear is the beginning of Wisdom: and glory is in the fear of God, and hope and strength is in Him.

(Sirach 27:4) 
He who fears God will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, for he is the hope of that person.

(Sirach 27:5) 
The soul of the person who fears God is blessed, with joy and consolation.

(Sirach 27:6) 
He who fears God, it will be well with him at the end: and on the day of his death he will be blessed.

(Sirach 27:7) 
The enemy of the fear of God, will not be justified: for his zeal will destroy him.

(Sirach 27:8) 
A wise man will be recognized in his words, and a sensible man will be proven in his works.

(Sirach 27:9) 
A man's works will be proven, and as a fire tests the potter's vessel, so are just men tested in the trial of tribulation.

(Sirach 27:10) 
He who believes in God, attends to the commandments: and he who trusts in Him, will not fail.

(Sirach 27:11) 
He who fears the Lord will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, for He is his hope.

(Sirach 27:12) 
Blessed is the soul of the person who fears God, to whom and towards whom he looks.

(Sirach 27:13) 
The fear of God is the beginning of His love, but faith in Him is in good works.

(Sirach 27:14) 
To love Him fully, is to fear God and keep His commandments.

(Sirach 27:15) 
This is the sense of doctrine: for those who have seen Him, will remain in eternal life.

(Sirach 27:16) 
He who fears God, will prepare his heart, and in His sight will sanctify his soul.

(Sirach 27:17) 
He who fears God, keeps His commandments, and he who trusts in Him, will be heard.

(Sirach 27:18) 
For God seeks hearts and souls: and He works in love.

(Sirach 27:19) 
He who fears God, desires to please God, and he who loves Him, will fulfill His laws.

(Sirach 27:20) 
He who fears the Lord, will prepare his heart, and humble his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 27:21) 
Falling into the hands of men, we fall into the hands of God: and according to His mercy, so is His judgment.

(Sirach 27:22) 
Speak before the Lord, and say: "According to what is Your will for me, Lord, and teach me Your discipline."

(Sirach 27:23) 
And direct my eye toward your commandments, and give me your fear.

(Sirach 27:24) 
Show me what is good, and what pleases you: for it is good, and I will keep it.

(Sirach 27:25) 
Everything that is, You have put upon me: and I will be instructed in Your commandments.

(Sirach 27:26) 
For every operation is according to judgment: and because of this, You will not be glorified for eternity.

(Sirach 27:27) 
And after these things, all my works will live: and each in his time will be praised.

(Sirach 28:1) 
The one who wants vengeance will find vengeance from God, and the sinner will remember all his sins.

(Sirach 28:2) 
Forgive your neighbor who has wronged you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.

(Sirach 28:3) 
Does a man hold anger against another man, and then expect healing from God?

(Sirach 28:4) 
Does a man not have mercy on another man, and then pray for his own sins to be forgiven?

(Sirach 28:5) 
He himself, being flesh, holds anger; and does he pray for forgiveness for his own sins?

(Sirach 28:6) 
Remember your last days, and stop being angry; think about corruption and death, and you will keep the commandments.

(Sirach 28:7) 
Think about the commandments, and you will not be angry with your neighbor.

(Sirach 28:8) 
Remember the covenant with the Most High, and forgive the offense.

(Sirach 28:9) 
Avoid provocation, and you will lessen your sins.

(Sirach 28:10) 
Do not be unjustly angry with your neighbor, nor do anything to insult him.

(Sirach 28:11) 
Pride is hateful to God and men, and from both, those who have pride have iniquity.

(Sirach 28:12) 
Nations, kingdoms, and the rulers are all proud.

(Sirach 28:13) 
From the race of men comes the proud race: and from the nations, the proud nation, and the proud nation will be despised.

(Sirach 28:14) 
Like flowing waters, so are riches from the proud: and they overflow beyond themselves.

(Sirach 28:15) 
The one who abandons, and the one who is angry, and the one who perishes: but as for what is, and the one who is sad.

(Sirach 28:16) 
All things on earth are from dust, and the king comes from the same man.

(Sirach 28:17) 
Who is greater in his work, than he who loves?

(Sirach 28:18) 
Wisdom and strength, and riches, and poverty, and the fear of the Lord are all glory.

(Sirach 28:19) 
Better is the poor man in his state, and strong and healthy in his work, than the rich man infirm in body.

(Sirach 28:20) 
The health of the soul is above all gold, and a strong body is above infinite riches.

(Sirach 28:21) 
There is nothing better than the health of the body, beyond riches.

(Sirach 28:22) 
There is no pleasure beyond the joy of the heart: and there is no life beyond a healthy body.

(Sirach 28:23) 
Death is the worst name: above all good things, it is the best.

(Sirach 28:24) 
A blessed life will not be given to death, nor does the dead look back, to act toward the living.

(Sirach 28:25) 
The wise man is firm in his words, in his heart, like a mountain standing in its height.

(Sirach 28:26) 
A fool in his words, is like a ship tossed about in the sea.

(Sirach 28:27) 
The wise man is silent, until the time is right, like the signs of clouds in a time of wind.

(Sirach 28:28) 
The wise man will be silent until he sees the right time: but the fool and the coward do not observe the time.

(Sirach 28:29) 
He who has a heart, sorrows in words: and the prudent man is silent until the time.

(Sirach 28:30) 
The wise man in his words, will cover himself, and the prudent man in his heart, will be delighted.

(Sirach 28:31) 
He who speaks in word, will be hateful: and he who takes audacity upon himself, will find hatred.

(Sirach 29:1) 
Whoever helps their neighbor lends to God, and what is given to God profits the giver.

(Sirach 29:2) 
Give to the poor, and you shall not be found wanting. Don't turn your back on the poor, and God will not turn His back on you.

(Sirach 29:3) 
Do good for your neighbor, to the best of your ability, and accept gifts.

(Sirach 29:4) 
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. Don't delay.

(Sirach 29:5) 
Don't say, “I'll seek and give tomorrow.” You do not know what tomorrow will bring.

(Sirach 29:6) 
The sinner prepares evil for an evil day, but the just will be delivered on the day of misfortune.

(Sirach 29:7) 
Don't look at the rich, the powerful, or the honorable, with envy.

(Sirach 29:8) 
Don’t look at anyone's face when judging unjustly.

(Sirach 29:9) 
Don’t plot evil against your neighbor, and don’t try to trick him.

(Sirach 29:10) 
God and all good people hate pride.

(Sirach 29:11) 
Both injustice and the one who commits it are detestable to God, and both will be punished by the sinner.

(Sirach 29:12) 
Don't return evil for evil, and don't answer an insult with an insult.

(Sirach 29:13) 
Flee the wicked man and his wickedness.

(Sirach 29:14) 
Uphold the just, and defend the innocent.

(Sirach 29:15) 
Don’t condemn the just along with the wicked, and don’t treat the wicked as just.

(Sirach 29:16) 
Show mercy to the just, and do what is right; then you will be confident in your righteousness.

(Sirach 29:17) 
Don't look at men's faces, and don't be afraid in judgment.

(Sirach 29:18) 
Do what is right to help the poor.

(Sirach 29:19) 
Don't let your tongue cause you to stumble, and don't block your own path.

(Sirach 29:20) 
Don’t be evil, and don't accept the favors of the powerful.

(Sirach 29:21) 
Don't hesitate to confess your sin, and don’t try to hide it.

(Sirach 29:22) 
Don't deny yourself before God and men, and don't be ashamed to admit your sin.

(Sirach 29:23) 
Don't say in your heart, “Because of my many gifts, I will hide my sins,” because God knows everything.

(Sirach 29:24) 
Don’t say, “Because of my many charitable deeds, God will give me mercy.”

(Sirach 29:25) 
Don't be afraid, because vengeance is not with God, nor will He be angry with you.

(Sirach 29:26) 
Be angry with your neighbor, but remember the Most High, and your anger will not be with you.

(Sirach 29:27) 
Remember your last days, and you will stop hating; corruption and death will remain in the commandments.

(Sirach 29:28) 
Remember the fear of God, and don’t be angry with your neighbor.

(Sirach 29:29) 
Remember the covenant of the Most High, and forgive your neighbor’s injuries.

(Sirach 29:30) 
Flee from lust, because death will pursue you.

(Sirach 29:31) 
Remember the commandments of the Lord, and don’t pay attention to the proud commands of men.

(Sirach 29:32) 
You will be justified on the day of your death, on the day of tribulation, and in the hour of retribution, the children of the wicked will turn against you.

(Sirach 29:33) 
Don't fear the proud in their thoughts, for the power of the wicked is like dust.

(Sirach 29:34) 
It is God who speaks, and He will destroy the proud. For who will touch and not fear?

(Sirach 29:35) 
And everyone who fears God and does His commandments is loved by Him.

(Sirach 29:36) 
Those who fear God trust Him, and those who cling to Him will not be shaken.

(Sirach 30:1) 
The one who loves a child will often discipline him, so that he may rejoice in the end.

(Sirach 30:2) 
The one who teaches his son will give joy, and will rejoice in him among his enemies.

(Sirach 30:3) 
The one who educates a fool is an enemy to himself; and the one who loves a fool will be saddened by him.

(Sirach 30:4) 
The one who believes fools acknowledges futility; and the one who trusts them will suffer harm.

(Sirach 30:5) 
The one who takes delight in wickedness gathers scandal for himself; and the one who hates corrections will have a diminished life.

(Sirach 30:6) 
The one who trusts in a fool is like himself; and the one who cannot resist temptation falls into evil.

(Sirach 30:7) 
There is no sorrow greater than sorrow, and sadness greater than sadness: the sorrow of riches and fools.

(Sirach 30:8) 
There is no wisdom in a man who works in vanity; and a foolish man amounts to nothing.

(Sirach 30:9) 
It is better to work and have sufficiency in all things, than to walk in idleness and be in need.

(Sirach 30:10) 
It is better to dwell in a solitary land than with a quarrelsome and angry woman.

(Sirach 30:11) 
It is better to work, and to have what is necessary, than to boast and be in need.

(Sirach 30:12) 
A wise man in his own affairs will be silent, as if sleeping; and he who sees, will reveal him.

(Sirach 30:13) 
It is better to hide one's folly than to hide wisdom.

(Sirach 30:14) 
It is miserable to have a foolish son; and the son of the wicked is without joy.

(Sirach 30:15) 
The one who fears God loves His commandments; and the one who keeps them will have life.

(Sirach 30:16) 
The one who fears God will receive instruction; and the one who watches over it, will be enlightened in the morning.

(Sirach 30:17) 
The one who seeks the law will be filled with it; and the one who is feigned in its ways will receive it.

(Sirach 30:18) 
The one who fears God will prepare his heart; and in His sight he humbles his soul.

(Sirach 30:19) 
The one who fears God keeps His commandments, and endures in patience as if in water.

(Sirach 30:20) 
This word is the beginning of the fear of God; and His sight, the test of the heart.

(Sirach 30:21) 
Every great plague and every small plague is upon the wicked; and the forgiveness of sins comes from God.

(Sirach 30:22) 
The one who offers gifts unjustly is like one who slaughters his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 30:23) 
The bread of the needy is the life of the poor; the one who withholds it is a man of blood.

(Sirach 30:24) 
The one who takes away bread by fraud is like the one who kills his neighbor.

(Sirach 30:25) 
The one who sheds blood and the one who commits fraud are brothers.

(Sirach 30:26) 
When you have built, and erected, what will remain for you? In time.

(Sirach 30:27) 
When you have gathered, and collected, what will remain for you? In time.

(Sirach 30:28) 
The one who is good in evils will not be considered good; and the wicked in good things will not be crowned.

(Sirach 30:29) 
The one who trusts in riches will rejoice, and the one who loves gifts will perish.

(Sirach 30:30) 
The one who detracts from friends, will perish; and the one who is impious will envy.

(Sirach 31:1) 
A rich man watching over his wealth is but a short sleep: a fool, though awake, is still dreaming.

(Sirach 31:2) 
A fool, even when awake, has nothing: he is always begging.

(Sirach 31:3) 
A foolish man's words are like a woman in labor.

(Sirach 31:4) 
The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel: it cannot retain any wisdom.

(Sirach 31:5) 
The wise man is full of speech, as if a river: and, like one ever thirsty, always has more to learn.

(Sirach 31:6) 
He that adds to his learning increases himself: but he that hates discipline shall die quickly.

(Sirach 31:7) 
A fool will act foolishly, and a wise man will bear it patiently.

(Sirach 31:8) 
The words of a fool are a burden on the road.

(Sirach 31:9) 
The mouth of a fool is like a herald of a banquet.

(Sirach 31:10) 
The mouth of fools quickly leads to sorrow.

(Sirach 31:11) 
The banquet of a sinner is not well-ordered.

(Sirach 31:12) 
A fool will not be steadfast in doctrine, but will pass away like a flower.

(Sirach 31:13) 
A foolish man is like a ruined house: and the understanding of the unwise is like a path unknown.

(Sirach 31:14) 
He that is untaught is like stones on the way.

(Sirach 31:15) 
The understanding of the unwise is like a weight on the road.

(Sirach 31:16) 
A wise man is like a life in learning: and he that despises it is like one about to die.

(Sirach 31:17) 
He that is good in word shall be filled with good things: and the fruit of his lips shall be fulfilled.

(Sirach 31:18) 
To glory in evil is foolishness: and a man of lies is like deep water.

(Sirach 31:19) 
Like stones in deep water, so are the hearts of the wicked: and as he that has despised God, so is their vengeance.

(Sirach 31:20) 
He that despises the law sins: and he that keeps the commandment shall be recompensed.

(Sirach 31:21) 
The grace of the Lord is like water in a dry land: and he that looks to mercy fulfills the commandments.

(Sirach 31:22) 
What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? And what is it? Seven times in the mouth of a fool.

(Sirach 31:23) 
Evil speech is in the mouth of the wicked: but in the mouth of the elect it shall please.

(Sirach 31:24) 
The heart of the wise man will think of parables: and the ear of the hearing desires wisdom.

(Sirach 31:25) 
The wise and the understanding man will beware of evil: and will dwell among the fools.

(Sirach 31:26) 
A fool will change like a wheel on a cart: and his thought is like a wheel in the sky.

(Sirach 31:27) 
A friend is like a horse, saying: "Upon which will you mount?"

(Sirach 31:28) 
Like a bird against the sun, so is the heart of the proud: and against the humble, as a sword turned.

(Sirach 31:29) 
The proud man loves destruction: and the proud man will not stand against evils.

(Sirach 31:30) 
In the heart of the prudent, is the word of wisdom: and like a river of life, righteousness.

(Sirach 31:31) 
A wise man knows the times and judgement: and in evils he does not labor a little.

(Sirach 32:1) 
The one who fears God will do good works, and the one who upholds justice will obtain it; he will receive it as a mother receives her children.

(Sirach 32:2) 
God will feed him with the bread of life and give him understanding and a rain of doctrine.

(Sirach 32:3) 
He will fulfill his confidence and give him eternal glory.

(Sirach 32:4) 
Evil thoughts, perversions of the heart, and wickedness destroy all.

(Sirach 32:5) 
The Holy Spirit departs from all, and wisdom goes away from things without understanding.

(Sirach 32:6) 
The wise man knows the words of wisdom and receives it, and the hearing of the desire is the judgment of the law.

(Sirach 32:7) 
Just as water puts out a fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 32:8) 
He who gives thanks is mindful of the future, and in due time will find favor.

(Sirach 32:9) 
As water puts out a blazing fire, so almsgiving resists sins.

(Sirach 32:10) 
He who gives grace is mindful of the future, and in due time will find favor.

(Sirach 32:11) 
Many give but do not have, and those who receive what is not theirs do evil.

(Sirach 32:12) 
Many become poor from great glory and are honored because of the hands of others.

(Sirach 32:13) 
Many have toiled in needs and have poverty in their life.

(Sirach 32:14) 
These are those who trust in themselves and look to their own glory.

(Sirach 32:15) 
Greater is he who is honored in poverty, and he who dishonors glory in abundance is less.

(Sirach 32:16) 
He who is justified in poverty is good, and he who is rich and becomes sad is wicked.

(Sirach 32:17) 
He who loves his soul flagellates it, and he who loves his son constantly chastises him.

(Sirach 32:18) 
He who bends his rod burdens his son, and will rejoice in him in the end.

(Sirach 32:19) 
He who teaches his son will have profit from him, and will glory in him among his acquaintances.

(Sirach 32:20) 
He who teaches his son will be envied by his enemy and will glory in him among his friends.

(Sirach 32:21) 
He who dies for his son is as if he had not died, for he has left a protector after him.

(Sirach 32:22) 
He who leaves a son as an heir in his testament leaves him as if he had left him from his treasures and trusts in him.

(Sirach 32:23) 
He who begets a son saves himself from his enemies, and the enemy will glory in him.

(Sirach 32:24) 
He who loves his son frequently flagellates him, so that he may rejoice in him in the end.

(Sirach 32:25) 
He who restrains his son binds up wounds, and is troubled by every sound.

(Sirach 32:26) 
An untamed horse becomes harsh, and a son neglected becomes willful.

(Sirach 32:27) 
Correct a boy and you will trouble his loins.

(Sirach 32:28) 
A goad for a horse, a rod for a donkey, and whips for a son.

(Sirach 32:29) 
Teach your son, and you will work with him, and you will not be ashamed of his behavior.

(Sirach 32:30) 
Do not abandon your soul to your desires, and do not afflict yourself with your own thoughts.

(Sirach 32:31) 
If you give your soul its desire in the thing it wants, it will make you a cause of joy to your enemies.

(Sirach 32:32) 
Do not glory in riches if you lose yourself, and do not say, “I have enough, and I will suffer nothing bad.”

(Sirach 32:33) 
Do not follow your soul in its desires; turn away from your desires.

(Sirach 33:1) 
One who fears God will avoid all evils, and by keeping His commandments, he protects himself.

(Sirach 33:2) 
A wise heart will know the law, and justice will grow like the moon.

(Sirach 33:3) 
The heart of the wicked seeks evil, but like a shadowy attempt, it vanishes.

(Sirach 33:4) 
A man of piety will be strong in wisdom like the sun, and his righteousness will be as firm as the moon.

(Sirach 33:5) 
The wicked heart scrutinizes iniquity, seeking evil, and will not cease until wrath descends.

(Sirach 33:6) 
The wicked are hated by the perfect man, and the just man curses the wicked.

(Sirach 33:7) 
A proven son is a hidden treasure, and one who loves him will honor him.

(Sirach 33:8) 
One who fears God lacks nothing: and as his works are, so shall his reward be.

(Sirach 33:9) 
He who hopes in the Lord will not fail: nor will he delay, and will not pass away.

(Sirach 33:10) 
He who fears God fears nothing: and he will not be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 33:11) 
The soul that fears God, whom will it fear? And in whom is his hope?

(Sirach 33:12) 
The eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him: a protector of strength, the foundation of hope, and a shadow from the sun on the right, a protection from ruin, and a defense against falling.

(Sirach 33:13) 
Enlightening the eyes, and giving grace, health, and life.

(Sirach 33:14) 
He who sacrifices unjustly offers a stained sacrifice: and the sacrifices of the unjust are not pleasing.

(Sirach 33:15) 
The Most High does not delight in the offerings of the wicked, nor will He be appeased for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.

(Sirach 33:16) 
He who offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who kills his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 33:17) 
The bread of the poor is the life of the needy: he who defrauds him is a man of blood.

(Sirach 33:18) 
He who takes away bread from labor is like one who kills his neighbor.

(Sirach 33:19) 
Those who shed blood, and those who defraud a hired worker, are brothers.

(Sirach 33:20) 
When you build, and when you destroy, what will you gain? Why pray if it is a burden to you?

(Sirach 33:21) 
When you fast, and again fast, and when you fast a third time, what do you gain? Because fasting is not pleasing to the Lord.

(Sirach 33:22) 
He who fasts for sins: and who puts away sins, let him beware lest he do them again: and he who prays for sins is foolish.

(Sirach 33:23) 
He who offers sacrifice from the substance of the poor, is like one who kills his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 33:24) 
The bread of the poor is life, he who defrauds him is a man of blood.

(Sirach 33:25) 
He who takes away bread from labor takes away the blood of his neighbor.

(Sirach 33:26) 
When you build, the wicked then build, and you who build, the wicked destroy: and when you pray, what will you pray for?

(Sirach 33:27) 
When you fast, you are not delighted: and when you offer, you will not be received.

(Sirach 33:28) 
What is the value of life, and what of works, and what of labor?

(Sirach 33:29) 
Do not contend with your children, nor use words against the wicked.

(Sirach 33:30) 
Turn away from the wicked man, and from the understanding of the impious.

(Sirach 33:31) 
Be to me in judgment, and defend me: and deliver me.

(Sirach 33:32) 
Give me confidence in your understanding: and do not confound me in fear.

(Sirach 33:33) 
Teach the fear of the Lord to your children, and God will humble your enemies.

(Sirach 33:34) 
The more you are exalted, the more humble yourself in all things, and you will find grace before God.

(Sirach 33:35) 
For there are many powerful, and unknown, and noble, and poor, all seeking the grace of God.

(Sirach 33:36) 
Those who feared the Lord, and feared, and did not despise his commandments.

(Sirach 33:37) 
Those who feared the Lord, hoped in him: and they were not abandoned.

(Sirach 33:38) 
Those who feared the Lord did not despise his words: and they were not disobedient to him.

(Sirach 33:39) 
Those who feared the Lord, and sought his pleasure, and loved him.

(Sirach 33:40) 
Those who feared the Lord, prepare their hearts, and humbled their souls in his sight.

(Sirach 33:41) 
Let us fall into the hands of men, and not into the hands of God: for according to his greatness and his mercy, so also is his rebuke.

(Sirach 34:1) 
The one who fears God will do good things, and the one who holds onto justice will grasp it fully.

(Sirach 34:2) 
And justice will meet him like an honorable mother, and she will meet him as a new wife does her husband.

(Sirach 34:3) 
Bread gives food to the living, and wisdom gives understanding to the heart.

(Sirach 34:4) 
In wisdom, his heart will be made strong, as if in the days of rain, and like a great river, his knowledge will overflow.

(Sirach 34:5) 
Just as a flood sends forth rivers, so too does the anger of the angry. As fire burns wood, so too does the anger of the arrogant.

(Sirach 34:6) 
God is merciful and good, and He will have mercy. In the days of affliction, He will show favor like the rain clouds.

(Sirach 34:7) 
The one who trusts in Him will not be afraid or fear, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 34:8) 
The soul of the one who fears God will not fear. Indeed, his hope is not in strangers.

(Sirach 34:9) 
Who has feared the Lord, and He has abandoned him? Or who has called upon Him, and He has despised him?

(Sirach 34:10) 
For God is compassionate and merciful, and He will forgive sins in the day of tribulation and protect all who confess themselves.

(Sirach 34:11) 
Woe to the cowardly heart, because it does not believe; therefore, it will not be protected.

(Sirach 34:12) 
Woe to the one who loses patience, and what will he do with what he has done?

(Sirach 34:13) 
The one who fears God will not be saddened, and the one who loves Him will keep His law.

(Sirach 34:14) 
The one who fears God will prepare his heart and sanctify his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 34:15) 
The one who fears God will seek to please Him, and those who love Him will fulfill His law.

(Sirach 34:16) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in the sight of the Most High.

(Sirach 34:17) 
Sinners will fall into the hands of God and will perish according to His wrath.

(Sirach 34:18) 
The impious man will not remain in repentance, and the sinner will not remain long.

(Sirach 34:19) 
The sinner and the impious speak harsh words and write their wicked deeds.

(Sirach 34:20) 
As is the generation, so too are their works.

(Sirach 34:21) 
The works of the proud are detestable to God, and He is angry with them.

(Sirach 34:22) 
Terrible vengeance is upon the impious nations.

(Sirach 34:23) 
The judgment of the day of death is for the sons of men.

(Sirach 34:24) 
Remember your last things, and you will cease to sin forever.

(Sirach 34:25) 
What is more beautiful than the sun and the moon? For even the shining star changes in its time.

(Sirach 34:26) 
And what is more beautiful than a vessel shining in goodness? For even gold and the emerald stone; and what is more beautiful than the beauty of a beautiful woman?

(Sirach 34:27) 
Nothing surpasses the beauty of a woman, and what is more delightful than a good man?

(Sirach 34:28) 
As the sun when it rises in the world, so is the beauty of a woman in the adornment of her home.

(Sirach 34:29) 
A lamp shining on a holy lampstand is how a face is in a beautiful stature.

(Sirach 34:30) 
As golden pillars upon a silver base, so are the feet upon stable soles.

(Sirach 34:31) 
What is the value against the eyes of a man who is alone, like beauty in appearance?

(Sirach 34:32) 
It is better for both, the one who keeps both; because both the one who is praised by him, and the one who loves him, is a friend.

(Sirach 34:33) 
The one who fears God will have both, and as is his fruit, so too is his glory.

(Sirach 34:34) 
It is not good to be wicked, and the proud is not honorable. For the one who does not fear the Lord will perish.

(Sirach 35:1) 
The one who honors God does good deeds, and the one who holds to the truth will grasp it like a fire, and he will hold to it.

(Sirach 35:2) 
The one who fears God will desire good, and he will receive the blessing as a mother's honor.

(Sirach 35:3) 
He will nourish himself on the bread of life and understanding, and he will drink the water of wisdom.

(Sirach 35:4) 
God will make him strong, and he will not be shaken. He will hold fast to God, and he will not be put to shame.

(Sirach 35:5) 
God will lift him up in the midst of the Church, and He will open his mouth with the fullness of the spirit of wisdom, and He will fill him with the spirit of understanding.

(Sirach 35:6) 
And God will clothe him in a garment of glory and a crown of joy.

(Sirach 35:7) 
Let your friends and your neighbors not separate from you. Be constantly with the powerful and the one who knows God.

(Sirach 35:8) 
Hold fast to the teaching of piety, and choose a just man and a God-fearing man.

(Sirach 35:9) 
May the spirit of the just be with you, and you will be glorified in the fear of God.

(Sirach 35:10) 
To hope in God is a great thing, and not to abandon His commandments is life.

(Sirach 35:11) 
The one who fears the Lord will fear nothing, and he will not be afraid because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:12) 
The Lord will not reject the soul of the one who fears God, and He will not abandon him in temptation.

(Sirach 35:13) 
The one who fears God will hope in Him, and his eyes are fixed on the Lord.

(Sirach 35:14) 
The one who fears God will not fear men, and he will not be troubled because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:15) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 35:16) 
To whom, in what manner, and by whom, and about what will he hope?

(Sirach 35:17) 
The eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear Him. He is a powerful protector, the foundation of strength, and a shelter from the burning sun, and a shade from the midday heat.

(Sirach 35:18) 
From the one who strikes with anger, and from the one who offends, He protects the soul, and delivers it from the troubles of the world.

(Sirach 35:19) 
The one who offers a sacrifice unjustly is stained. The offerings of the wicked will not be accepted.

(Sirach 35:20) 
The Lord is good to those who love Him.

(Sirach 35:21) 
They do what is just and labor in the judgment of truth.

(Sirach 35:22) 
Do not turn to wickedness, and do not follow the path of sinners.

(Sirach 35:23) 
All wickedness is an abomination to God, and He will punish sinners for it.

(Sirach 35:24) 
You will not be separated from the wicked without cause, and you will depart from sins.

(Sirach 35:25) 
Do not be joined to a disobedient son, and depart from the sons of sinners.

(Sirach 35:26) 
Recognize the time, and beware of evil.

(Sirach 35:27) 
A good soul will endure all things, and it will be crowned for its patience.

(Sirach 35:28) 
If you find yourself in affliction, remain. In your patience, have patience.

(Sirach 35:29) 
Accept whatever happens to you, endure pain, and be patient in your humility.

(Sirach 35:30) 
For gold and silver are tested in fire, and men are tested in the furnace of humility.

(Sirach 35:31) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you. Direct your ways, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 35:32) 
The one who fears God will fear nothing, and will not be troubled because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:33) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 35:34) 
For God looks upon those who love Him.

(Sirach 35:35) 
Those who fear God, and who endure in His works, will find grace from Him.

(Sirach 35:36) 
The one who seeks the Law will be filled with it, and the one who meditates on its work will be glorified.

(Sirach 35:37) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts, and in His sight, they humble their souls.

(Sirach 35:38) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and their sins will not be removed.

(Sirach 36:1) 
God of all, show mercy to us and look upon us. Let Your face shine upon us, and have mercy.

(Sirach 36:2) 
So we may know Your ways and understand Your paths.

(Sirach 36:3) 
Show us Your mercy, Lord, and grant us Your salvation.

(Sirach 36:4) 
I will speak in my tribulation: The Lord has been my hope.

(Sirach 36:5) 
My soul is troubled, and because of this, I remember You from the land of the Jordan, and from Hermon and the little mountain.

(Sirach 36:6) 
Deep calls to deep at the voice of Your cataracts; all Your high things and Your waves have passed over me.

(Sirach 36:7) 
In the daytime the Lord commanded His mercy, and at night His song.

(Sirach 36:8) 
My prayer is to God, the life of my soul.

(Sirach 36:9) 
I will say to God: You are my protector and my refuge, my God, for You are merciful to me.

(Sirach 36:10) 
For the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth comes prudence and understanding.

(Sirach 36:11) 
Whoever comes from the earth and is upon the earth returns to dust, and so it is with those who pursue and those who offer.

(Sirach 36:12) 
All men are like the earth, and Adam was fashioned from the earth.

(Sirach 36:13) 
In the knowledge of God, He separated them and scattered their ways.

(Sirach 36:14) 
Whoever does iniquity is an abomination, and whoever acts proudly is unjust.

(Sirach 36:15) 
What is pride? It is death.

(Sirach 36:16) 
All things that move upon the earth will turn to dust; and He who created them is also from the earth.

(Sirach 36:17) 
The body of man lasts but a time: what is more than all that is born of the earth?

(Sirach 36:18) 
Nothing is above the sun, and nothing is more empty than the tongue of the wicked.

(Sirach 36:19) 
Blessed are those in wisdom, and those in understanding, and those who meditate on God in their thoughts.

(Sirach 36:20) 
The wise will be in their heart, and they will proclaim the teachings of justice.

(Sirach 36:21) 
Whoever is wise will also teach wisely, and whoever listens will judge.

(Sirach 36:22) 
The more you are wise, the greater you will be, and the more you grow, the more great things will be in you.

(Sirach 36:23) 
He who sees much will understand more than a man.

(Sirach 36:24) 
Who has investigated His works? And who will declare His marvels?

(Sirach 36:25) 
For what is man? What is his understanding? And what will he do?

(Sirach 36:26) 
The number of a man's days, at best, is one hundred years. What is that in the sight of eternity?

(Sirach 36:27) 
Like a drop of the sea, and like a drop of rain: and who can number the sea, and the drops, and the days of the age?

(Sirach 36:28) 
There are three things my soul feared, and I feared a fourth: when a rumor about a city arises, and the gathering of a multitude,

(Sirach 36:29) 
and the slander of the people: it is more horrible than death.

(Sirach 36:30) 
Misery and sorrow is when a woman is jealous of her husband, and when jealousy becomes angry.

(Sirach 36:31) 
The tongue is a sharp sword, and anger and disturbance are unjust.

(Sirach 36:32) 
He who loves God will have life, and he who loves Him will receive discipline.

(Sirach 36:33) 
He who fears God will be in good, and he who hopes in Him will not fail.

(Sirach 36:34) 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of His love; and faith is chosen with justice.

(Sirach 36:35) 
His Spirit is life, and refreshment: He will visit those who love Him, and He will appear to them in His joy.

(Sirach 36:36) 
He who fears God will prepare his heart, and in His sight he will humble his soul.

(Sirach 36:37) 
He who fears God will hope in Him, and as in His sight, so also he will find mercy.

(Sirach 36:38) 
He who seeks the law will be filled with it: and he who is on its way will be loved.

(Sirach 36:39) 
He who fears God will understand judgment, and he will be enlightened like light.

(Sirach 36:40) 
The sinner despises the law: and he will find in it according to his own will.

(Sirach 36:41) 
The wicked man does not direct his heart, and therefore he will not prosper.

(Sirach 36:42) 
When a wicked man is saddened, he curses: and he will find bitterness of heart.

(Sirach 36:43) 
The proud man will not be filled with doctrine: and as in a vessel of ignorance, so it will not be in him.

(Sirach 36:44) 
The wise man will hear the words of wisdom, and will test them; and a parable in doctrine, and he will understand the sense.

(Sirach 37:1) 
Every truly wise man will seek reverence for God, and he will learn wisdom and justice, and embrace discipline.

(Sirach 37:2) 
Whoever fears God will do good, and whoever is careful to be just, will have his prayers heard.

(Sirach 37:3) 
Whoever fears God honors his parents, and is like a servant to them who gave him life.

(Sirach 37:4) 
In deed and word, honor your father and your mother, and in all patience.

(Sirach 37:5) 
So that God's blessing may come to you, and remain with you until the end of your life.

(Sirach 37:6) 
Son, assist your father in his old age, and do not grieve him during his life.

(Sirach 37:7) 
Even if his mind has failed, have mercy on him, and do not despise him when you are strong.

(Sirach 37:8) 
For the alms of your father will not be forgotten, and for the sins of your mother, you will have a store of merit.

(Sirach 37:9) 
In the day of your tribulation, you will remember them, and as ice melts in the heat, so will your sins be forgiven.

(Sirach 37:10) 
A son is cursed who forsakes his father, and who embitters her who gave him birth.

(Sirach 37:11) 
Perform your works with gentleness, and you will be honored by men.

(Sirach 37:12) 
The greater you are, humble yourself in all things, and you will find favor before God.

(Sirach 37:13) 
For God is great in power, and He favors those who are humble.

(Sirach 37:14) 
Those who seek to understand His majesty are overwhelmed by His glory.

(Sirach 37:15) 
For in the searching of those who seek, glory is hidden, and in power, He conceals glory.

(Sirach 37:16) 
Observe the proper time for your tasks, and beware of evil.

(Sirach 37:17) 
Do not do what is displeasing to Him, and do not believe evil.

(Sirach 37:18) 
Before all your works, know your end, and then act accordingly.

(Sirach 37:19) 
Before judgment, do what is just, and before you investigate, justify yourself.

(Sirach 37:20) 
Before illness, take care of yourself, and before judgment, examine yourself, and you will find favor in the sight of God.

(Sirach 37:21) 
Before death, work, and at the appointed time, you will die like a passing man.

(Sirach 37:22) 
As leaves on a blooming tree, and fruits, so are the generations of human flesh.

(Sirach 37:23) 
One generation of man is born, and another follows, and as a leaf falls from a tree, so too does the generation of flesh and blood.

(Sirach 37:24) 
One follows another, and he himself remains in his own generation, and after that, what will he gain from his works?

(Sirach 37:25) 
All things return to the earth, and like water, so are the just.

(Sirach 37:26) 
The many works of the wicked will be scattered, but justice will remain forever.

(Sirach 37:27) 
The riches of the wicked dry up like a torrent, and will resound like a great thunder in the rain.

(Sirach 37:28) 
They open their hands, and rejoice: but transgressors will be consumed.

(Sirach 37:29) 
The root of the wicked will not produce branches, and the unclean branches will not bear fruit.

(Sirach 37:30) 
The children of the wicked will not multiply, and an impious people will not have a root.

(Sirach 37:31) 
The children of the just are like branches, a holy planting.

(Sirach 37:32) 
And the seed of the elect is like a strengthened root.

(Sirach 37:33) 
The just man is known by his fruit, and his memory will not be taken away forever.

(Sirach 37:34) 
In judgment, he will not fear, and he will stand confidently at the end.

(Sirach 37:35) 
A heart that fears God, and in His commandments, will find wisdom.

(Sirach 37:36) 
He who does not fear God will not be justified, because His wrath falls upon him.

(Sirach 37:37) 
The patience of a man is seen in his dealings with his neighbor, and his works are marked with sense.

(Sirach 37:38) 
God hates the proud man, and all wickedness is detestable to Him.

(Sirach 37:39) 
God has removed nations from the unjust, and has planted the humble in their place.

(Sirach 37:40) 
God gave the land to the nations, and He took Israel as an inheritance.

(Sirach 37:41) 
All the works of men are before Him, and those who will stand before Him will not be hidden from His eyes.

(Sirach 37:42) 
From age to age, He looks, and nothing is a marvel before Him.

(Sirach 37:43) 
It is not right to say, 'What is this?' or 'Why is this?', because in all His will, God will act.

(Sirach 37:44) 
The blessing of a man is like a flower, and the just man's fruit will remain.

(Sirach 37:45) 
Do not say, 'What is this?' or 'What is that?' because all things will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 37:46) 
God will immediately justify in His word, and in a moment He will hasten judgment.

(Sirach 37:47) 
The wicked man who rejects God and has an iniquitous heart will multiply evils for himself.

(Sirach 38:1) 
Honor the doctor, for his service is a necessity, because God Himself created the doctor to heal.

(Sirach 38:2) 
And all healing comes from the Most High: it is a gift from God, and the doctor will receive it.

(Sirach 38:3) 
The doctor's knowledge will lift up his head, and he will be admired by the great.

(Sirach 38:4) 
God made medicines from the earth, and a prudent man will not reject them.

(Sirach 38:5) 
Wasn't bitter water sweetened by a tree? The power of the doctor is seen in his works.

(Sirach 38:6) 
God gave knowledge to men, so that they might be glorified in His wonders.

(Sirach 38:7) 
With them he cures and alleviates pain: and with them he makes a medicine, so that his work may be perfected.

(Sirach 38:8) 
Son, when you are sick, do not be negligent: but pray to God, and He will heal you.

(Sirach 38:9) 
Turn away from sin and direct your hands, and cleanse your heart from every fault.

(Sirach 38:10) 
Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour, and make a fat sacrifice.

(Sirach 38:11) 
And give the doctor his place, because he too is necessary: because God Himself created him.

(Sirach 38:12) 
For there is a time when there are prosperities in their hands.

(Sirach 38:13) 
And they will pray to God, that He may direct them on the way, and to the progress of healing and to life.

(Sirach 38:14) 
He who sins against Him Who made him, let him fall into the hands of the doctor.

(Sirach 38:15) 
Son, pour out tears over the dead, and begin to mourn as if you were suffering evil.

(Sirach 38:16) 
And bury his body according to custom: and do not be idle over his burial.

(Sirach 38:17) 
Mourn with love, and lament for her, because she is worthy: and make mourning for her according to her merits, for one or two days, because of the curse, and then be consoled after your sorrow.

(Sirach 38:18) 
For sorrow causes death, and the life of a sinful man.

(Sirach 38:19) 
After the death of a man, his inheritance rests: and before his death, his life.

(Sirach 38:20) 
When he lives, and breathes, he is changed: and he labors, and is troubled.

(Sirach 38:21) 
A wise man in doctrine, and abounding in wisdom, he will work righteousness.

(Sirach 38:22) 
He who looks to the law of the Most High, will acquire it: and he who is occupied with it, will be glorified.

(Sirach 38:23) 
Those who work in it, will say: Because there is no labor in it: and the children of wisdom are justified.

(Sirach 38:24) 
He who prepares his words, will be heard: and he who perseveres in his prayers, will obtain.

(Sirach 38:25) 
His heart will search at dawn: and he will persevere in his doctrine.

(Sirach 38:26) 
A wise heart will seek good things: and for all who are occupied with it, it will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 38:27) 
Like the work of a potter, and his work: all his works are in his will.

(Sirach 38:28) 
All his works are in his will: and He commanded, and they will be done in His will.

(Sirach 38:29) 
The Lord loves holy works: and He has love for all his chosen ones.

(Sirach 38:30) 
Water and fire, and sword and wars, and famine and pestilence: all these were created for the use of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:31) 
They were changed for evil: and for the punishment of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:32) 
All things that are created are in two: good and evil.

(Sirach 38:33) 
Such are all the works of the wicked: and contrary to the works of the saints.

(Sirach 38:34) 
It is not wonderful that glory is given in a moment and in time: since when it is present, it is not wonderful.

(Sirach 38:35) 
It is better, therefore, that he should work in evil in good days.

(Sirach 38:36) 
The works of the just are like the sun: and the works of the wicked, night and darkness.

(Sirach 38:37) 
It is better for you, to preserve your soul, than to walk in the sight of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:38) 
A wise man in speech is detestable: and a fool will not remain in it.

(Sirach 38:39) 
The wise man in speech, and in doctrine will become hateful.

(Sirach 38:40) 
He gave sense to the wise, and he found the treasure of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:41) 
For he who works in the will, does not perfect himself in the work: and he who is angry, corrupts his soul.

(Sirach 38:42) 
The heart of the patient, is until the time: and then joy will be returned to him.

(Sirach 38:43) 
His speech is brief, until the time: and afterwards his lips will drip words of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:44) 
In the treasures of wisdom are the words of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:45) 
The treasure of impiety is hateful, for he who is occupied with them is detestable.

(Sirach 38:46) 
Son, if you have, work with fear, and do all things in faith.

(Sirach 38:47) 
In all your work, look to your end, and you will not sin for eternity.

(Sirach 39:1) 
The wisdom of the just will explain its judgment, and the assembly will hear his praise.

(Sirach 39:2) 
You will not be praised by the mouth of the wicked, for he is the father of iniquity.

(Sirach 39:3) 
Praise will be in the mind of the just, and the nations will speak of his wisdom.

(Sirach 39:4) 
The mouth of the wicked is like dead wood: they will see, and they will rejoice.

(Sirach 39:5) 
You will not give riches to the wicked, and the just will not see iniquity.

(Sirach 39:6) 
The wicked will hate the just, and the just will hate him.

(Sirach 39:7) 
The wicked and the iniquitous are alike.

(Sirach 39:8) 
The tribulations of the just are from the hand of the wicked: scourges and death.

(Sirach 39:9) 
Wise men understand wisdom and put it forth in the sight of lords: and judgement, and the teaching of justice and judgement.

(Sirach 39:10) 
They hope in God, and they will be saved: and they keep his commandments, and they will find him.

(Sirach 39:11) 
Those who fear the Lord will find judgement and will illuminate their justice like fire.

(Sirach 39:12) 
The sinner will not regard wisdom, but his iniquity will be called upon him.

(Sirach 39:13) 
The son of a fool will destroy his father, and he who has no understanding will shame his mother.

(Sirach 39:14) 
Woe to you, fools, because you have not observed the law of God: when you fall, you will not be.

(Sirach 39:15) 
It is better for a man without wisdom, and not having wisdom, than having it and sinning.

(Sirach 39:16) 
It is better for a man who does not have wisdom to fear, than to have it and be saddened.

(Sirach 39:17) 
It is better for a man without wisdom and sinning, than to multiply wisdom and sins.

(Sirach 39:18) 
Let him fear himself, and sustain himself in the sight of God, and in his judgement wisdom will liberate him.

(Sirach 39:19) 
The wisdom of men is to know their way: and to recognize the power of him who made it.

(Sirach 39:20) 
He who knows his ways will know his laws, and will show glory in his judgement.

(Sirach 39:21) 
He who does not know wisdom, nor its power, will perish in judgement.

(Sirach 39:22) 
My son, do not have many things in your works: and if you do many things, you will not be free from blame: and if you follow after, you will not attain.

(Sirach 39:23) 
Do not hasten after riches, nor the powerful in judgement.

(Sirach 39:24) 
Do not despise the poor in judgement: because he is humble and you will be thankful to him, and do not grieve the poor in your sight.

(Sirach 39:25) 
Do not do injury against a hungry soul: and do not provoke a man in need.

(Sirach 39:26) 
Do not add to a saddened mind: and do not delay because of the needy.

(Sirach 39:27) 
Do not die for the soul of the poor, and do not turn your eyes away from the needy.

(Sirach 39:28) 
Turn away from a reviling tongue: and do not associate with him who slanders, because the ruin of his work is in his mouth.

(Sirach 39:29) 
Do not seek sin, and do not scrutinize those things which do not pertain to you.

(Sirach 39:30) 
Son, do not have many business dealings: for if you multiply them, you will not be free from blame: and if you follow after them, you will not attain, and you will not escape, and you will not succeed.

(Sirach 39:31) 
Many have labored to become rich, and their life is for nothing: and who are they?

(Sirach 39:32) 
But others have labored and did not hasten, and others progressed, and did not find.

(Sirach 39:33) 
But others have labored and did not have: and in this too they labored.

(Sirach 39:34) 
Others worked and were careful, and did not take care: and in this too they labored.

(Sirach 39:35) 
I saw a certain man who labored in those things which he had prepared, and did not have food to eat.

(Sirach 39:36) 
All these things are in the fear of God: and in his will.

(Sirach 39:37) 
Like the works of the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the clouds, and the wind, and the waters, and the spirits, and the thunders, and the lightnings.

(Sirach 39:38) 
Who do these in their time, and they will return on their day.

(Sirach 39:39) 
Those who act from God, and his commandments, will be blessed in their works.

(Sirach 40:1) 
God made great wisdom, and is perfect in all His works.

(Sirach 40:2) 
Who can count the grains of sand in the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of the world?

(Sirach 40:3) 
Who can measure the height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, or the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 40:4) 
Wisdom was created before everything: understanding of prudence comes from eternity.

(Sirach 40:5) 
The source of wisdom is the Word of God in the highest heavens, and its path is eternal law.

(Sirach 40:6) 
To whom was the root of wisdom revealed, and who has known its shrewdness?

(Sirach 40:7) 
There is only one Almighty Creator, a powerful King, greatly feared, who sits on his throne and rules.

(Sirach 40:8) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit, saw it, counted it, and measured it.

(Sirach 40:9) 
He poured wisdom out over all His works, over all flesh according to His gift, and gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 40:10) 
Fear of the Lord is glory, boasting, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 40:11) 
Fear of the Lord will delight the heart, give joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 40:12) 
It will go well for those who fear God in the end, and they will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 40:13) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of it: and they love Him through sanctification.

(Sirach 40:14) 
The love of wisdom is honor: and those to whom she appears love her.

(Sirach 40:15) 
Fear of God is the fulfillment of God's commandments: and whoever holds it, lives as if in paradise.

(Sirach 40:16) 
Every sensible person, and whoever understands wisdom, will hate evil.

(Sirach 40:17) 
The source of wisdom is the Word of God in the highest heavens: and its path is eternal law.

(Sirach 40:18) 
To whom are the roots of wisdom revealed, and who has known its shrewdness?

(Sirach 40:19) 
There is one most high, almighty creator, a powerful king greatly to be feared, sitting upon His throne, and ruling as God.

(Sirach 40:20) 
He created it in the Holy Spirit, and saw it, and counted it, and measured it.

(Sirach 40:21) 
And He poured it out over all His works, and over all flesh according to His gift: and He gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 40:22) 
Fear of God is glory, boasting, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 40:23) 
Fear of God delights the heart, and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 40:24) 
It will be well for those who fear God in the end, and they will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 40:25) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of it: and they love Him through sanctification.

(Sirach 40:26) 
The love of wisdom is honor: and those to whom she appears love her.

(Sirach 40:27) 
The fear of God is the fulfillment of God's commandments: and whoever holds it, dwells as if in paradise.

(Sirach 40:28) 
Every sensible person and whoever understands wisdom, will hate evil.

(Sirach 40:29) 
Son, if you receive your soul, keep it from lust, and give it what it desires.

(Sirach 40:30) 
Do not give your soul to lust, and turn away from your own will.

(Sirach 40:31) 
If you give your soul to appetite, it will make your enemies happy.

(Sirach 40:32) 
Do not delight in pleasures, and do not let their expenses turn you aside.

(Sirach 40:33) 
Do not become a beggar in poverty: it is better to die than to be in need.

(Sirach 40:34) 
The life of a man who is in his work, who is in his agriculture, who is in his vineyards, and who is in the work of artifice, and in his riches.

(Sirach 40:35) 
It is better to work than to go begging: and to hope under the table of others.

(Sirach 40:36) 
In the life of those who are in their work, and who are in their agriculture, and who are in their vineyards, and who are in the work of artifice, and in their riches.

(Sirach 40:37) 
In their work all find wisdom.

(Sirach 40:38) 
The poor in his work, and those who work in labor, is better than the rich who err.

(Sirach 40:39) 
Son, keep your soul in peace, and fear God.

(Sirach 40:40) 
From His splendor comes the Holy Spirit, and His fear, and there is nothing in His precepts.

(Sirach 40:41) 
Every soul loves wisdom with fear: and whoever keeps it will be amazed.

(Sirach 40:42) 
Whoever holds wisdom will possess life.

(Sirach 40:43) 
But whoever fears God will obtain both: and whoever holds it will be enlightened.

(Sirach 40:44) 
Whoever holds her will be enlightened: and she will meet him like a mother.

(Sirach 40:45) 
She will feed him with the bread of life, and give him the water of understanding to drink.

(Sirach 40:46) 
He will trust in her, and will not be ashamed: and he will exalt her, and will rule among men: and will open his mouth in prayer, and will be heard even by God.

(Sirach 40:47) 
And afterwards he will direct his mind to her: and he will converse in her knowledge.

(Sirach 40:48) 
If you love your soul, son, keep chastity, and give her what pleases.

(Sirach 40:49) 
If you lust in your soul, depart from your will, and from your own will.

(Sirach 40:50) 
This is the good of man, a good conscience, and honor is in all justice.

(Sirach 41:1) 
Remembering death and life—this is the beginning of wisdom.

(Sirach 41:2) 
In life, be mindful of good things and avoid evil.

(Sirach 41:3) 
The sins of the wicked are their enemies, and they love those who commit evil.

(Sirach 41:4) 
Every living creature loves its own kind, and every person loves their neighbor.

(Sirach 41:5) 
All living things associate with their own, and people associate with their equals.

(Sirach 41:6) 
What fellowship can exist between a wolf and a lamb? So too, between a sinner and a righteous person.

(Sirach 41:7) 
What peace is there between a hyena and a dog? That is how it is with sinners.

(Sirach 41:8) 
Who can associate with the unclean? What common ground is there between truth and lies?

(Sirach 41:9) 
There is no agreement between a righteous person and a sinner, and no harmony among the wicked.

(Sirach 41:10) 
A lion stalks donkeys in search of prey; that's how sinners hunt those who do evil.

(Sirach 41:11) 
Scorn is for the wicked, and reproach for sinners.

(Sirach 41:12) 
Do not let your heart be filled with sorrow.

(Sirach 41:13) 
Do not stray onto their paths.

(Sirach 41:14) 
Don't linger on the paths of sinners, lest you fall into their traps.

(Sirach 41:15) 
Turn away from them, or you will be lost. You will be safe from evil.

(Sirach 41:16) 
Do not go near them, lest you come to love their sins.

(Sirach 41:17) 
And you will be taken by their destruction.

(Sirach 41:18) 
Do not let your soul fall into their power.

(Sirach 41:19) 
Be careful not to go down their paths.

(Sirach 41:20) 
Do not stray from the paths of the wicked, lest your feet slip.

(Sirach 41:21) 
Do all your work in faith; this is the way of the commandments.

(Sirach 41:22) 
Faith is the preservation of salvation.

(Sirach 41:23) 
Works of justice light the way.

(Sirach 41:24) 
Those who do good will prepare rewards for themselves.

(Sirach 41:25) 
Those who do what is right will be filled with them.

(Sirach 41:26) 
Like water for the thirsty, so is the sinner.

(Sirach 41:27) 
They look at bitter things, but hope for what they cannot obtain.

(Sirach 41:28) 
Those who forsake the law despise His hand, and those who walk in the ways of the wicked offend Him.

(Sirach 41:29) 
Those who turn their hearts to vanity multiply their sins.

(Sirach 41:30) 
Good is returned to the good, and evil to the evil.

(Sirach 41:31) 
The iniquity of sinners is not wiped away, but a pious man will receive grace.

(Sirach 41:32) 
The good of a person is given, and the iniquity of the impious is reserved.

(Sirach 41:33) 
Do not say: “I have turned away from God. What is hidden from Him? Who remembers me?”

(Sirach 41:34) 
Think that you are seen by Him, and all your works bear witness.

(Sirach 41:35) 
Do not say: “God does not see, and He has turned away His face, and does not look at my ways.”

(Sirach 41:36) 
Because all your works are before Him, and all things are arranged in His sight.

(Sirach 41:37) 
Your works will always be before Him. You will be glorified for what you have done.

(Sirach 42:1) 
The wise contemplate all of His works, and the entire world is filled with His glory.

(Sirach 42:2) 
He established the universe; through His will, He created everything. Indeed, the Almighty spoke, and all things were made.

(Sirach 42:3) 
Who can ever explain the beauty of all His glorious works, or the full measure of His glory?

(Sirach 42:4) 
The sky's vastness, its height, the foundations of its splendor are the wonders He created.

(Sirach 42:5) 
The sun, when it appears in the universe, proclaims how wondrous is God's creation.

(Sirach 42:6) 
Midday's heat, and the sun's warmth in the changing seasons, is yet another example of His work.

(Sirach 42:7) 
He created frost and cold, and snow. They have their own courses, and their appointed seasons.

(Sirach 42:8) 
The wind, the clouds, and the spirit are all at His command.

(Sirach 42:9) 
All of these things give glory to God, who is the Spirit and Creator of all things.

(Sirach 42:10) 
God directs thunder at the appointed time, and creates tempests through His power.

(Sirach 42:11) 
He created the rivers, too, and directs them to serve His judgment, so that they may never fail.

(Sirach 42:12) 
Day and night display God's works, just as the sun always shines.

(Sirach 42:13) 
All living creatures think and feel in their own time, both day and night.

(Sirach 42:14) 
The sea with its depths, and its creatures, shows us His wonders.

(Sirach 42:15) 
The Holy Spirit, fire, and wind are all at God’s disposal on the day of judgment for vengeance.

(Sirach 42:16) 
God created water and clouds to give food to men.

(Sirach 42:17) 
He created seeds, and gave life on earth to men and women for their salvation.

(Sirach 42:18) 
He sends His people among the nations. Through these people, God’s judgment is at work.

(Sirach 42:19) 
And what does the work of man accomplish? His works are within him.

(Sirach 42:20) 
He created man from the earth, and gave him strength.

(Sirach 42:21) 
He said: “I created all things, and the whole earth is full of my power.”

(Sirach 42:22) 
He is wise, strong, just, and fears God. And in the days of the just, he will be honored.

(Sirach 42:23) 
The man who fears God will be honored, and the knowledge of the Law will be in him.

(Sirach 42:24) 
There is no fear of God in those who do not fear Him; instead, there is wrath, envy, and conflict.

(Sirach 42:25) 
Evil days are coming, and the wicked will be destroyed.

(Sirach 42:26) 
All things are created and will endure to their proper time.

(Sirach 42:27) 
For one is not like another, and one’s day of death is approaching.

(Sirach 42:28) 
There are two types of creation: good and evil.

(Sirach 42:29) 
The Lord will judge, and each man will receive what he has done.

(Sirach 42:30) 
The Lord will also judge the heart and mind.

(Sirach 42:31) 
Those with good hearts will receive the reward of their goodness, but those with evil hearts will receive their punishment.

(Sirach 42:32) 
Evil is the cause of all wicked deeds.

(Sirach 42:33) 
All creation is subject to sin, and all that is done is to be judged according to what is done.

(Sirach 42:34) 
The wicked will receive evil for evil.

(Sirach 42:35) 
The good will receive good for their good deeds.

(Sirach 42:36) 
The Lord sees with a discerning eye and will judge justly.

(Sirach 42:37) 
The Lord will always remember what each person does, and in their days he will judge.

(Sirach 42:38) 
There is no remembrance of what has been done, and no respite from the punishment.

(Sirach 42:39) 
My son, do good deeds, and seek the counsel of the wise.

(Sirach 42:40) 
Be cautious, and do not let your heart be swayed by any evil or wickedness.

(Sirach 42:41) 
Carry out your work well, and do not hesitate. Perform what you have been assigned to do.

(Sirach 42:42) 
Do not be ashamed of these words; have no shame in keeping His commandments.

(Sirach 42:43) 
Do not be ashamed of the Lord’s truth and His covenant, and speak the truth in the sight of all men.

(Sirach 42:44) 
Do not be ashamed to speak the truth, and do not conceal what you see.

(Sirach 42:45) 
Do not be ashamed to be questioned, and never be afraid to be just.

(Sirach 42:46) 
And do not be ashamed to keep the Sabbath and the Lord’s feasts.

(Sirach 42:47) 
And do not be ashamed to pay your vows, and to offer what you promised.

(Sirach 42:48) 
And do not be ashamed to pray to God and give alms, and to pay them.

(Sirach 42:49) 
Do not be ashamed to visit the sick, and to care for your deceased.

(Sirach 42:50) 
Do not be ashamed to be counted among the blessed and just.

(Sirach 42:51) 
Do not be ashamed to speak boldly, and do not hesitate to speak the truth.

(Sirach 42:52) 
But be ashamed of evil, wickedness, and injustice.

(Sirach 42:53) 
Do not be ashamed to correct the foolish, or to rebuke those who are unjust.

(Sirach 42:54) 
Follow your training, and do not be afraid to speak in the sight of all, and offer what is commanded.

(Sirach 42:55) 
The Lord is always with you, and His word gives you strength.

(Sirach 43:1) 
The sun is magnificent as it rises; its appearance is wonderful when it emerges.

(Sirach 43:2) 
At noon it scorches the land, and who can endure its heat?

(Sirach 43:3) 
The sun is like a furnace that provides heat. It is in the mountains, radiating outwards.

(Sirach 43:4) 
The sun is like a golden crown. Its position is perfect in its season.

(Sirach 43:5) 
The sun proclaims its own work and its rising, and it announces wonders.

(Sirach 43:6) 
How great is the work of the Lord! His wonders are hidden!

(Sirach 43:7) 
Who can know its strength?

(Sirach 43:8) 
And who can describe its works?

(Sirach 43:9) 
The moon is also magnificent at its time, in the months, to the season; it is a sign of the times.

(Sirach 43:10) 
The moon is from the table to the decrease and change in the months.

(Sirach 43:11) 
The moon is a sign of the feast, shining in the sky: the splendor of the sky.

(Sirach 43:12) 
The glory of the stars is its beauty in splendor on high from the Lord.

(Sirach 43:13) 
In the words of the Holy One, they shine in the expanse of the sky and are beautiful in their glory.

(Sirach 43:14) 
By the command of the Holy One, they stand in their place and do not tire in their vigils.

(Sirach 43:15) 
Look at the rainbow, and bless the one who made it; it is very beautiful in its radiance.

(Sirach 43:16) 
The rainbow surrounds the sky with its glory; the hands of the Most High have stretched it out.

(Sirach 43:17) 
He quickly sends out his command and hastens to go out, and does not delay in his day.

(Sirach 43:18) 
Who can describe the strength of the clouds, and who can describe the speed of thunder?

(Sirach 43:19) 
As the thunder comes out, it crushes the earth, and the mountains will thunder.

(Sirach 43:20) 
In its horror, the heart of my heart trembles, and I am disturbed by its cold.

(Sirach 43:21) 
When the spirit blows, ice solidifies, and like a flying bird, it passes.

(Sirach 43:22) 
In its appearance, the waters are amazed, and the ice is over the waters, almost like outside.

(Sirach 43:23) 
All the works of the Lord are good, and he will give each in its time.

(Sirach 43:24) 
We should not say, 'This is worse than that,' because all things will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 43:25) 
Now, with words, praise God and magnify him as much as you can.

(Sirach 43:26) 
Exalt him, and exalt him as much as you can, for he is greater, and you will not tire.

(Sirach 43:27) 
Who has seen him and can describe him? And who will magnify him as he was in the beginning?

(Sirach 43:28) 
Many hidden things are greater than these, for we have seen only a few of his works.

(Sirach 43:29) 
For God made all things and gave wisdom to the impious.

(Sirach 43:30) 
Wisdom knows knowledge and shows his signs and works of praise.

(Sirach 43:31) 
He who lives forever created all things in common and gave them individually to the impious.

(Sirach 43:32) 
He made known his works, and we have heard his glory.

(Sirach 43:33) 
The word on these things is much, and in short, let us say that he is all things.

(Sirach 43:34) 
All the works of God are good and will be done in their time.

(Sirach 43:35) 
We should not say, 'This is worse than that,' because all will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 43:36) 
So now, with your whole heart and voice, praise and bless God.

(Sirach 44:1) 
I will now offer praise to the famous men of old, and their memory will be blessed for all time.

(Sirach 44:2) 
The prophets of old have found their rest, and in their lives is glory.

(Sirach 44:3) 
Their people walk with them, and recount their heroic acts.

(Sirach 44:4) 
The Lord has shown mercy to the elect, whose accomplishments are miracles. They never wavered in their devotion to God.

(Sirach 44:5) 
Their good works continue in their descendants, their holy heritage.

(Sirach 44:6) 
Their descendants will keep the covenant, and their children will be guided by them.

(Sirach 44:7) 
Their descendants will endure forever, and their glory will never be forgotten.

(Sirach 44:8) 
Their bodies were buried in peace, and their names live on for all generations.

(Sirach 44:9) 
The wise will speak with wisdom, and their righteousness recounts the praises of God.

(Sirach 44:10) 
Many will sing his praises, and his memory will never fade.

(Sirach 44:11) 
His memory is as sweet as honey in the mouth, and like music at a banquet of wine.

(Sirach 44:12) 
He was disciplined in his studies, in his teachings, and in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 44:13) 
The saints will not fail in their good works, and their works of mercy will endure.

(Sirach 44:14) 
Their good works will endure, and their holiness will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 44:15) 
Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives on through all generations.

(Sirach 44:16) 
The wise leave a good reputation, which they announce in the midst of the people.

(Sirach 44:17) 
The teachings of the wise are like jewels of honor, and they are honored wherever they appear.

(Sirach 44:18) 
But the foolish seize the earth, and their glory is quickly forgotten.

(Sirach 44:19) 
A wicked son diminishes his father's glory, and one born without fear is held in contempt.

(Sirach 44:20) 
A righteous son honors his father, and in the sight of the Lord, he vindicates his mother.

(Sirach 44:21) 
Those who fear God honor their parents, and they will serve their masters as though they were their own children.

(Sirach 44:22) 
In deed and word, honor your father and mother, and give them joy at all times.

(Sirach 44:23) 
With all your heart, bless your father, and pray for the sins of your mother.

(Sirach 44:24) 
Those who show mercy to their father are like those who store up treasures, and those who honor their mother store up treasures.

(Sirach 44:25) 
Those who fear God honor their parents and serve them as they would their masters.

(Sirach 44:26) 
Son, support your father in his old age, and do not grieve him in his life.

(Sirach 44:27) 
Even if his mind fails, be patient with him, and do not despise him in your strength.

(Sirach 44:28) 
The alms given to your father will never be forgotten, and for the sins of your mother, you will find refreshment.

(Sirach 44:29) 
In the day of your tribulation, remember them, and your sins will melt away like frost in the heat.

(Sirach 44:30) 
Whoever abandons their father is like a blasphemer, and whoever angers their mother is cursed by God.

(Sirach 44:31) 
Son, persevere in your work with gentleness, and you will abound in their love.

(Sirach 44:32) 
The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself in all things, and you will find favor with God.

(Sirach 44:33) 
For the power of God alone is great, and He is honored by the humble.

(Sirach 44:34) 
Do not seek things that are too high for you, and do not search into matters that are beyond your reach.

(Sirach 44:35) 
But always reflect on the commandments given to you, and do not involve yourself with too many of His works.

(Sirach 44:36) 
You do not need to involve yourself with the things that are hidden from you.

(Sirach 44:37) 
Do not become overly involved in your own affairs, and do not meddle in too many works.

(Sirach 44:38) 
For many things are shown to you which are beyond human understanding.

(Sirach 44:39) 
And the deception of many impious people will mislead them, and their wicked hearts will bring them down.

(Sirach 44:40) 
The heart of the hard-hearted will be burdened with sorrow, and the wicked will add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 44:41) 
In their afflictions, they will add more sins.

(Sirach 44:42) 
In their sorrows, they will add to their impiety.

(Sirach 44:43) 
The arrogance of the wicked is not justified, for the wicked are like a thorn in the wind.

(Sirach 44:44) 
The just man believes in the law, and his hope is in the law of the Lord.

(Sirach 44:45) 
Those who fear God do good, and those who practice justice will acquire it, and children will greet them as if they were a virtuous mother.

(Sirach 44:46) 
The children of the just are like a virtuous mother, and they will rejoice in them.

(Sirach 44:47) 
Those who fear the Lord will have a good end, and on the day of their completion, they will find grace.

(Sirach 45:1) 
The priesthood of Aaron and Moses began on the day when God gave them their mission.

(Sirach 45:2) 
The Lord then consecrated them, just as brothers.

(Sirach 45:3) 
He made them holy by His power and proved their faithfulness.

(Sirach 45:4) 
God chose them from among men, and then gave them the law of life.

(Sirach 45:5) 
God made a covenant with them that would last forever, and he showed them his ways.

(Sirach 45:6) 
He made them glorious and gave them great strength.

(Sirach 45:7) 
He gave them priestly garments and beautiful ornaments, clothing them in all that was needed.

(Sirach 45:8) 
Their duties were holy, and they were always mindful of God's honor.

(Sirach 45:9) 
They fulfilled their duties during their own time, and God was with them.

(Sirach 45:10) 
Their good works are remembered to this day.

(Sirach 45:11) 
Other men were anointed kings and given priestly duties.

(Sirach 45:12) 
And Moses, like Aaron, was honored in the sight of God and men.

(Sirach 45:13) 
The Lord blessed him and gave him a place of honor in His sanctuary.

(Sirach 45:14) 
He gave him authority over the various nations and distributed the tribes of Israel to him.

(Sirach 45:15) 
He gave Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, the eternal law and the covenant of peace.

(Sirach 45:16) 
He made an everlasting covenant with him and gave him the priesthood over the nation, glorifying him.

(Sirach 45:17) 
He placed him over the holy people, and he confirmed for him and his sons the right to offer incense and sacrifices to God.

(Sirach 45:18) 
And his priestly sons ministered to him, along with Moses and his anointed ones.

(Sirach 45:19) 
In his own time, Moses completed the work, and his glory increased.

(Sirach 45:20) 
He distributed the portions of the nations, dividing them among the twelve tribes.

(Sirach 45:21) 
He gave him the inheritance of the holy things, and all the best first fruits.

(Sirach 45:22) 
He extended his hand in sacrifice and offered sacrifices of libation as a sweet fragrance.

(Sirach 45:23) 
He glorified Aaron and blessed him, giving him an inheritance.

(Sirach 45:24) 
To Moses, however, he gave the commandments and judgments for the people, and he showed him his glory.

(Sirach 45:25) 
He made Aaron, a holy man, very similar to himself: and gave him an everlasting crown and priesthood.

(Sirach 45:26) 
And he did the same for Moses.

(Sirach 45:27) 
The sons of Aaron multiplied through the generations, becoming a family and inheriting.

(Sirach 45:28) 
So also was David, to whom God gave an eternal kingdom.

(Sirach 45:29) 
And Solomon, who was a wise man, sat on the throne of his kingdom.

(Sirach 45:30) 
And they reigned with justice.

(Sirach 45:31) 
Their glory will be with them, and the glory of their fathers will be in the hands of their sons.

(Sirach 45:32) 
The wise are well-instructed in their words and in the signs of their wisdom.

(Sirach 45:33) 
A wise man's teachings are like the rain, and wisdom will always be proven right.

(Sirach 45:34) 
Now, praise and honor wise men.

(Sirach 45:35) 
For the learned will be judged by them, and judgment will be known from them.

(Sirach 45:36) 
They will be praised among the nations and honored in the city.

(Sirach 46:1) 
Samuel, the strong one, powerful in his works, judged the Lord.

(Sirach 46:2) 
Afterwards, he slept with his ancestors and showed the Lord the king.

(Sirach 46:3) 
He gave anointing upon his head and appointed David as king.

(Sirach 46:4) 
A holy man, he judged the people and sanctified the people.

(Sirach 46:5) 
He surrounded his enemies, roaring like a lion on the path.

(Sirach 46:6) 
He gave him power forever and established a covenant with his descendants.

(Sirach 46:7) 
He sent Jacobites from among the nations and gave them land in division, distributing them according to their parts and the tribes of Israel.

(Sirach 46:8) 
And their memory is blessed forever.

(Sirach 46:9) 
Like the sun, Elias illuminated and knew the Lord.

(Sirach 46:10) 
In the word of the Lord, he judged, and at his word, the judge ceased.

(Sirach 46:11) 
He raised the dead from death and, from the abyss, at the word of the Most High.

(Sirach 46:12) 
He cast down kings and the glorious into ruin.

(Sirach 46:13) 
He heard the rebuke on Sinai and the judgments of vengeance at Horeb.

(Sirach 46:14) 
He anointed kings for repentance and the prophets after him, as a testimony of eternity.

(Sirach 46:15) 
He was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fire.

(Sirach 46:16) 
He is written in the judgments of the times, to appease the wrath of the Lord, in time.

(Sirach 46:17) 
He turned the heart of the father to the son and restored the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 46:18) 
Blessed are those who saw you and were in your friendship.

(Sirach 46:19) 
For we live by life, but after death, such a name will not be.

(Sirach 46:20) 
Elias was covered in a whirlwind of fire, and Elisha was filled with his spirit.

(Sirach 46:21) 
In his days, he did not fear the ruler, nor did any power disturb him.

(Sirach 46:22) 
His word surpassed all things, and in his life, he performed miracles.

(Sirach 46:23) 
He did not trust his heart, nor did he fear flesh, because he was strengthened in the faith of the Lord.

(Sirach 46:24) 
After death, his body prophesied, and even after his passing, he prophesied.

(Sirach 46:25) 
In his life, he did signs, and in his death, wonders.

(Sirach 46:26) 
In all these, the people did not acquiesce, nor did they depart from their sins, until they were expelled from their land.

(Sirach 46:27) 
And among all the nations who did not believe and did not work miracles.

(Sirach 46:28) 
In the days of Noah, they saw, and were saved: and in Noah, the world was created.

(Sirach 46:29) 
He was found to be a friend of God, and in the judgment, he was found just.

(Sirach 46:30) 
In temptation, he was found perfect, and he was found just.

(Sirach 46:31) 
Therefore, God gave him a covenant with Noah: that it would be forever over all flesh.

(Sirach 46:32) 
Abraham, the great father of many nations, and there is no one like him found in glory.

(Sirach 46:33) 
He kept the law of the Most High and made a covenant with Him.

(Sirach 46:34) 
In his flesh, he established a covenant, and in temptation, he was found faithful.

(Sirach 46:35) 
Therefore, he confirmed it to him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed.

(Sirach 46:36) 
That he would multiply his seed like the dust of the earth and exalt his seed like the stars.

(Sirach 46:37) 
And He gave him an inheritance, from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

(Sirach 46:38) 
Isaac and Jacob He blessed and gave them a blessing.

(Sirach 46:39) 
He placed the blessing of all nations upon their heads and placed His covenant and love in Jacob.

(Sirach 46:40) 
He sanctified him in His sanctifications and preserved him from temptations and delivered him.

(Sirach 46:41) 
He magnified him in the sight of all men and established him among all nations.

(Sirach 46:42) 
The covenant was confirmed in him, and the blessing He gave him, and He distributed it among the parts.

(Sirach 46:43) 
He gave the inheritance in parts and divided the twelve tribes.

(Sirach 47:1) 
The prophet Elijah arose like a fire, and his word burned like a torch.

(Sirach 47:2) 
He brought famine upon them, and in his zeal he reduced them to a few.

(Sirach 47:3) 
By the Word of the Lord, he closed the sky, and three times he brought down fire.

(Sirach 47:4) 
How glorious you were, Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! Who is like you in glory?

(Sirach 47:5) 
You raised the dead from death, and from the underworld at the command of the Most High.

(Sirach 47:6) 
You brought kings to ruin, and the mighty from their beds.

(Sirach 47:7) 
You heard judgment on Sinai, and judgments of vengeance on Horeb.

(Sirach 47:8) 
You anointed kings for repentance, and established prophets to succeed you.

(Sirach 47:9) 
You were taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses.

(Sirach 47:10) 
You are recorded in the judgments of the ages, to appease the wrath of the Lord, so as to reconcile the heart of the father to the son.

(Sirach 47:11) 
And restore the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 47:12) 
Blessed are those who saw you, and were adorned with your friendship.

(Sirach 47:13) 
For while we live, we have life, and after death we will have nothing like it.

(Sirach 47:14) 
Elijah was covered in spirit, and Elisha was filled with his spirit. In his days, he did not fear a prince, and no power could overcome him.

(Sirach 47:15) 
His word surpassed all things, and his heart prophesied.

(Sirach 47:16) 
He slept in peace, and his eye remained watchful even in sleep.

(Sirach 47:17) 
His signs are in their portions, and he is known among the nations.

(Sirach 47:18) 
In Elisha, a double spirit; he performed great signs and wonders, and judged by his word.

(Sirach 47:19) 
He feared no one, and no human spirit could overcome him.

(Sirach 47:20) 
His heart did not waver, and nothing could disturb his will.

(Sirach 47:21) 
His works are holy and glorious, and his wonders have been performed in the sight of all.

(Sirach 47:22) 
Therefore, he did not give up in his sins, and after his death, his body prophesied.

(Sirach 47:23) 
In his life, he worked wonders, and in death, he performed miracles.

(Sirach 47:24) 
In all these things, the people did not believe, and they did not cease from their sins until he was taken away from the earth.

(Sirach 47:25) 
And the heart of the people did not understand, nor did they know the works of God and the works of His hands.

(Sirach 47:26) 
He was like a tree in his works; and afterwards there were those who would judge him.

(Sirach 47:27) 
This is concerning the people; and later, concerning all nations.

(Sirach 47:28) 
For who will search out the strength of the Lord? And who will declare His glory?

(Sirach 47:29) 
For who is great in His works? And who will change His works?

(Sirach 47:30) 
God made all things, and this is good in His sight.

(Sirach 47:31) 
Each one for their own works.

(Sirach 47:32) 
For he who says: 'This is what is,' what is it? And who will honor His works?

(Sirach 47:33) 
After these things, we will praise the holy men in their works, who did not fail in the fear of Him.

(Sirach 47:34) 
Nations were saved in their own righteousness.

(Sirach 47:35) 
The people of the Lord were saved in their own righteousness.

(Sirach 47:36) 
And we will praise the glorious in glory, who gave glory in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 47:37) 
There were those who did not have, that they might work: in the mercies which were given, they were justified.

(Sirach 47:38) 
Some remained with their seed: and some were not born.

(Sirach 47:39) 
This one was glorified, and that one was offered up.

(Sirach 47:40) 
He gathered wealth and treasured it like silver.

(Sirach 47:41) 
And he was not found in his works; and he became a stranger.

(Sirach 47:42) 
His sons and his grandsons were sinners.

(Sirach 47:43) 
From his lineage, seed remained, and from the nations.

(Sirach 47:44) 
From a good father, inheritance remains in the sons.

(Sirach 47:45) 
But even from him, inheritance has perished to the wicked sons.

(Sirach 47:46) 
Those who are not just have lost their inheritance, and have perished with the sinners.

(Sirach 47:47) 
Love your friends more than gold and silver.

(Sirach 47:48) 
For a good treasure is better than gold and silver.

(Sirach 47:49) 
Life and soul are better in the grace of love.

(Sirach 47:50) 
There is no better treasure than gold, and a good man is better than silver.

(Sirach 47:51) 
A friend and neighbor in a time of need, is found in the day of tribulation.

(Sirach 47:52) 
Life is not to be compared to gold, and the best companionship of a good man is beyond measure.

(Sirach 47:53) 
Love piety more than gold and silver, more than treasures.

(Sirach 48:1) 
The prophet Elijah rose up, glowing like a fire. His words were like a torch that burned.

(Sirach 48:2) 
He brought them famine, and in his zeal, he made them few in number.

(Sirach 48:3) 
By the Lord's word, he closed the sky, and he made fire fall three times.

(Sirach 48:4) 
How glorious you became, Elijah, in your wonders! Who is like you in glory?

(Sirach 48:5) 
You raised the dead from death and from the underworld by the word of the Most High.

(Sirach 48:6) 
You brought kings to ruin, and easily broke them from on high.

(Sirach 48:7) 
You heard judgment on Sinai and the judgments of vengeance on Horeb.

(Sirach 48:8) 
You anointed kings to do penance and prophets in their lineage.

(Sirach 48:9) 
You were received into a fiery whirlwind in a chariot of fiery horses.

(Sirach 48:10) 
You are written in the judgments of the times, to placate the Lord's anger, to turn the father's heart to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 48:11) 
Blessed are those who saw you and were adorned in your friendship.

(Sirach 48:12) 
For we also live, but when we die, we will die with the dead.

(Sirach 48:13) 
Elijah was taken up in the whirlwind, and Elisha was filled with his spirit. In his days, he did not fear a prince, and no one had power over him.

(Sirach 48:14) 
His word surpassed all power. He performed signs in his life and wonders in his death.

(Sirach 48:15) 
In all these things, the people did not repent, and they did not turn away from their sins, until they were cast out of their land and scattered throughout the earth.

(Sirach 48:16) 
The nation was forsaken, and there was no one to show them mercy.

(Sirach 48:17) 
I remember Jeremiah the prophet, who was sanctified from the womb to be a prophet, to destroy, to plant, and to build.

(Sirach 48:18) 
Who in a holy vision brought rain and sent fire upon the people from heaven.

(Sirach 48:19) 
Who was denounced for bloodshed and who gave rebuke to sinners before he died.

(Sirach 48:20) 
Who ascended into heaven, and now gathers souls by the Lord's hand, and sees with power in all things.

(Sirach 48:21) 
Concerning Ezekiel, who saw the vision of glory, which was shown to him in the chariot of the cherubim.

(Sirach 48:22) 
For he remembers enemies in the rain and gives thanks to those who do good.

(Sirach 48:23) 
And of the twelve prophets: may their bones sprout from their place, for they consoled Jacob, and they consoled with great faith.

(Sirach 48:24) 
How shall we honor Zerubbabel? He became like a signet ring on the right hand.

(Sirach 48:25) 
Likewise, Joshua, the son of Nun, who became great in his power in his days.

(Sirach 48:26) 
He gave testimony about him, that after the setting of the sun, he made the sun stand still, and one day, he made double.

(Sirach 48:27) 
He called upon the Most High with strength, surrounding them in battle.

(Sirach 48:28) 
He gave testimony to him in glory, that he fulfilled before God until the end.

(Sirach 48:29) 
In the testimonies of Moses, the holy man knew, and David in his mercies.

(Sirach 48:30) 
Solomon rested in peace, and in his days, the sun was disturbed.

(Sirach 48:31) 
For they did their works and went to their rest.

(Sirach 48:32) 
For in all things, they taught the people, and in them, their doctrine.

(Sirach 48:33) 
Their memory rises, and their name will not fail.

(Sirach 48:34) 
A nation will proclaim wisdom, and their praise will be spoken in the church.

(Sirach 49:1) 
The memory of Josias is like a pleasant scent, like honey in the mouth, like music at a wine banquet.

(Sirach 49:2) 
He turned away from sin, leading his people in the right way, removing the abominations of iniquity.

(Sirach 49:3) 
His heart turned toward God and was not weakened by impiety.

(Sirach 49:4) 
Beyond David, Ezechias, and Josias, all others sinned, forsaking the law of the Most High, forgetting His blessings.

(Sirach 49:5) 
The mighty kings of Judea grew weak, failing in wars.

(Sirach 49:6) 
They abandoned the law of God, despised His covenant, and did not follow the commandments of the righteous, nor did they walk the path of justice, and so they were all destroyed.

(Sirach 49:7) 
The Lord saw their impiety because they had departed from Him.

(Sirach 49:8) 
So He divided them among the nations, scattering them across the earth.

(Sirach 49:9) 
He brought in strangers against them and multiplied their enemies in the land.

(Sirach 49:10) 
Their deeds were changed; in all their ways they were altered.

(Sirach 49:11) 
But in the days of Josias, there was peace, and the land rejoiced in his rest.

(Sirach 49:12) 
His heart was strengthened towards the Lord, and he was not weakened by impiety.

(Sirach 49:13) 
For all that was before him, and all that came after him, brought impiety and forgetfulness of iniquity upon the earth.

(Sirach 49:14) 
And his works were just in the eyes of the Lord, and in all his life.

(Sirach 49:15) 
The rest of the words of Josias, his mercy toward the Lord, his piety, and all that he did, are written in the book of the kings of Judea.

(Sirach 49:16) 
And so Josias, son of Amon, became king of Judea.

(Sirach 49:17) 
The memory of Josias, they make in his composition like a scent, and like honey in the mouth, like music at a wine banquet.

(Sirach 49:18) 
And these things in his life were for all the people, to the glory of God.

(Sirach 49:19) 
And Josias acted to put down impiety and removed the abominations of iniquity.

(Sirach 49:20) 
He directed his heart to the Lord and was strengthened in the times of the wicked.

(Sirach 49:21) 
Moreover, the works of David and Solomon, their magnificence and holiness, are written in the book of Kings.

(Sirach 49:22) 
Indeed, none of those who were on earth are compared to Josias in the works of God.

(Sirach 49:23) 
Because in all his works, he acted well and also he was glorious.

(Sirach 49:24) 
Solomon was a father of peace; and God gave him peace, and it ceased all his days.

(Sirach 49:25) 
And Solomon acted and built the house of God in his days.

(Sirach 49:26) 
Although the wisdom of Solomon was great and glorious, in parables, proverbs, sentences, and answers,

(Sirach 49:27) 
In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, he gathered gold like a pond and multiplied silver like sand.

(Sirach 49:28) 
You placed it in his womb, and from your wisdom, you gave it to him.

(Sirach 49:29) 
You exalted his honor and fulfilled his glory.

(Sirach 49:30) 
You gathered his enemies, and removed the wicked, and exalted his kingdom.

(Sirach 49:31) 
For the glory of Solomon illuminated even to a distant time, and his name among the nations was famous because of these things.

(Sirach 49:32) 
But insanity, pride, iniquity, and perversity corrupted his heart.

(Sirach 49:33) 
He divided the kingdom, and a rebellious kingdom rose up against him.

(Sirach 49:34) 
But the Lord will remain in all His blessings and does not abandon His graces, nor does He diminish His works; nor does He take away from His holy ones, nor does He change His works.

(Sirach 49:35) 
He left their remnants, and the names of His elect. And all His works endure forever.

(Sirach 50:1) 
The great high priest is a glory to his brothers, like the sun when it rises.

(Sirach 50:2) 
Like the moon during its days; when it is full it lights the whole world.

(Sirach 50:3) 
Feast days and the season of the months, those feasts make the celebration.

(Sirach 50:4) 
Like the shining sun, so he shines when in the Temple of God.

(Sirach 50:5) 
Like a rainbow, which brings glory during the cloud-filled days of a festival.

(Sirach 50:6) 
Like a rose in the springtime, and during the days of roses: so he is beautiful during his days.

(Sirach 50:7) 
Like the cedar that is raised up on the mountains of Lebanon, or like a palm tree standing tall.

(Sirach 50:8) 
So is he, when he is raised up in his days.

(Sirach 50:9) 
Like an olive tree with its fruit, or a cypress that has been raised in height.

(Sirach 50:10) 
When he put on the robe of glory, and was covered with perfect majesty, he ascended the holy altar.

(Sirach 50:11) 
Around the holy altar, the brilliance of the veil, is like a crown of palm branches, or like roses during the springtime.

(Sirach 50:12) 
Around him is a crown of glory, like the horns of a bull, or like a vessel of incense in the Temple.

(Sirach 50:13) 
The son of Aaron is like snow in the winter, or like a rose during the springtime.

(Sirach 50:14) 
Like fire and incense in the censer.

(Sirach 50:15) 
A golden vessel adorned with gems, with every sort of beauty.

(Sirach 50:16) 
After entering from the Temple, he is like the morning star coming from the cloud.

(Sirach 50:17) 
Like the moon in its fullness, and like the shining sun.

(Sirach 50:18) 
The call during the feast days, and like the rainbow in the cloud of glory.

(Sirach 50:19) 
Golden vessels, and hyacinthine ornaments, and garments of silk, and purple.

(Sirach 50:20) 
Chosen gifts, and the best donations.

(Sirach 50:21) 
Sweet bread, and the intoxication in the scent.

(Sirach 50:22) 
In this time, my heart was mindful, and my spirit was troubled.

(Sirach 50:23) 
I feared because of the fear of the Lord, and His glory.

(Sirach 50:24) 
I feared the multitude of sinners, and His glory.

(Sirach 50:25) 
And I extended my hand, and I implored and said:

(Sirach 50:26) 
I have sinned, and I have acted wickedly, and I have failed, and I was not worthy of Your sight.

(Sirach 50:27) 
Because I know that you do not judge mankind in any place.

(Sirach 50:28) 
If I give witness about my own works, I will not be exalted: because my works are many and evil.

(Sirach 50:29) 
If I am righteous, all my works are with Him: and I am not worthy.

(Sirach 50:30) 
Because behold, in Him is all my justice.

(Sirach 50:31) 
And of this I have acted wickedly, because I have done until the end.

(Sirach 50:32) 
And the Lord heard me.

(Sirach 50:33) 
And He turned my mourning into joy, and my tribulation into joy.

(Sirach 50:34) 
And this has been given back to me by the Lord, and glory was made for me before all.

(Sirach 50:35) 
Descend into humility, and I will bless the Lord, and I will praise Him.

(Sirach 50:36) 
Receive the doctrine, you who are ignorant, and place it in your hearts.

(Sirach 50:37) 
Because he who finds it is near.

(Sirach 50:38) 
Hear me, little ones, and like a rose in the field, sprout the scent.

(Sirach 50:39) 
And give the scent, like incense, and bloom with a flower, and place grace before Him.

(Sirach 50:40) 
Because God is great, and our Lord lives forever.

(Sirach 50:41) 
Amen, amen.

(Sirach 51:1) 
I will give thanks to You, O Lord my King, and I will praise You, my God, my Savior.

(Sirach 51:2) 
I confess Your holy name, because You have always been my protector and helper. You have freed my body from destruction, from the traps set by lying tongues, and from the lips of those who plot falsehoods.

(Sirach 51:3) 
You were always my helper. You rescued me from my enemies because of Your great mercy and Your holy name. You saved me from the jaws of those who prepared to devour me and from the hands of those who sought to kill me, and from the many troubles that I suffered,

(Sirach 51:4) 
and from the fire that surrounded me: I was delivered from the fire.

(Sirach 51:5) 
I will give thanks to You, I will praise You, and I will bless the Lord.

(Sirach 51:6) 
When I was still young, before I wandered astray, I sought wisdom openly.

(Sirach 51:7) 
And I prayed for her in the presence of the Temple.

(Sirach 51:8) 
And I sought her in the sight of the saints.

(Sirach 51:9) 
And afterwards, I realized that people do not have her.

(Sirach 51:10) 
So I went after her and sought her, and I entered into her way.

(Sirach 51:11) 
And I grasped her, and I blossomed, and I did not hide her.

(Sirach 51:12) 
My heart was troubled in her.

(Sirach 51:13) 
Therefore, I opened my mouth and spoke: “Listen, you powerful ones, and all you peoples, and incline your ears.

(Sirach 51:14) 
Pay attention, children, and adults, and hear the words of my mouth.

(Sirach 51:15) 
Teach your children doctrine, and bless them with her, because those who guard her, live.

(Sirach 51:16) 
The path of the just shines like the sun, and always goes towards perfection.

(Sirach 51:17) 
But the unjust do not know the ways of the just, and the seed of the wicked will burn like fire.

(Sirach 51:18) 
Guard yourself from evil, and do no evil, and do no injustice.

(Sirach 51:19) 
Flee from injustice, or it will seize you.

(Sirach 51:20) 
Son, do not involve yourself in vanity, and do not give your heart to things that are not necessary.

(Sirach 51:21) 
Turn away your eyes, and guard yourself from corruption.

(Sirach 51:22) 
Set your soul in righteous justice, and your works in the commandments of God.

(Sirach 51:23) 
Have faith with your neighbor, and work in the fear of God.

(Sirach 51:24) 
And know that all flesh withers like grass, and like the green leaves on a tree, and like the fruit that falls from a tree.

(Sirach 51:25) 
Because all flesh will quickly fail, but He who made all things, will endure.

(Sirach 51:26) 
Do not fear the judgment of death. Remember that those who came before you and those who will come after you, will pass away.

(Sirach 51:27) 
All flesh withers like a leaf, but he who is justified is like an ever-living tree.

(Sirach 51:28) 
The unjust falls like a dead tree, and his glory, once pushed, disappears like smoke.

(Sirach 51:29) 
Because good works are like a strong tree, and good thought is like a strong root.

(Sirach 51:30) 
A good root gives good fruit.

(Sirach 51:31) 
Poverty and the lack of mercy, and justice and the fear of God. For in these is life.

(Sirach 51:32) 
He who keeps the law will acquire it, and the end of his fear, is wisdom.

(Sirach 51:33) 
For him who is not unjust, there is no fear, but in all his ways is confidence.

(Sirach 51:34) 
Blessed is he who has life with wisdom, and he who speaks with sense, and he who meditates on justice, and he who considers the wisdom of God with understanding.

(Sirach 51:35) 
For if you do what pleases God, you will live, and you will be justified in all your works.

(Sirach 51:36) 
And then I will say: 'Give to the Lord everything that you do, and in due time, offer your sacrifice to Him.'

(Sirach 51:37) 
Give thanks to Him, make sacrifices of justice, and hope in Him.
