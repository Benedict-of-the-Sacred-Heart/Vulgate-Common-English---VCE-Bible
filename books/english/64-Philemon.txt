(Philemon 1:1) 
Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother in faith, to Philemon, our beloved coworker,

(Philemon 1:2) 
and to Apphia, our sister in faith, to Archippus, our fellow soldier for Christ, and to the Church that meets in your home.

(Philemon 1:3) 
Grace and peace be with you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philemon 1:4) 
I always thank my God and remember you in my prayers,

(Philemon 1:5) 
because I hear about your love and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus Christ, and how you show it to all the holy people in the Church.

(Philemon 1:6) 
I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through your recognition of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:7) 
For I have received great joy and comfort from your love, because you have refreshed the hearts and lives of the holy people, my brother.

(Philemon 1:8) 
Therefore, although I have much confidence in Christ to command you to do what is proper,

(Philemon 1:9) 
I rather appeal to you because of love. I, Paul, am an old man now, and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:10) 
I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus, whom I have fathered spiritually while I have been in prison.

(Philemon 1:11) 
He was once useless to you, but now he is useful to both you and me.

(Philemon 1:12) 
I am sending him back to you. Please receive him, that is to say, receive my very heart and soul.

(Philemon 1:13) 
I truly wanted to keep him with me, so that he could serve me on your behalf while I am in prison for the Gospel.

(Philemon 1:14) 
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but rather a voluntary act of your free will.

(Philemon 1:15) 
For perhaps he departed from you for a short time for this very reason: that you might have him back forever,

(Philemon 1:16) 
no longer as a slave, but as a beloved brotherâ€”far more than a slave. He is especially beloved to me, and how much more so to you, both physically (in the flesh) and spiritually (in the Lord)?

(Philemon 1:17) 
So if you consider me a partner in the faith, welcome him as you would welcome me.

(Philemon 1:18) 
If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge it to my account.

(Philemon 1:19) 
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay you. I do not need to mention that you owe me even your very self.

(Philemon 1:20) 
Yes, my brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart and soul in Christ.

(Philemon 1:21) 
I write to you confident in your obedience, knowing that you will do even more than what I am asking.

(Philemon 1:22) 
Also, at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

(Philemon 1:23) 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings.

(Philemon 1:24) 
Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers, also greet you.

(Philemon 1:25) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
