(Lamentations 1:1) 
How lonely she now sits, the city that was once full of so many people!
She has become like a widow, she who was the sovereign lady over many nations.
She who ruled among the provinces is now forced to pay tribute.

(Lamentations 1:2) 
She weeps bitterly throughout the night, and her tears stream down her cheeks.
Among all those who once loved her, there is no one to comfort her.
All her former friends have scorned her and have now become her enemies.

(Lamentations 1:3) 
Judah has been forced to go into exile because of her great affliction and her overwhelming servitude.
She now lives among foreign nations, but she finds no rest there.
All of her persecutors have overtaken her in these times of great distress.

(Lamentations 1:4) 
The roads leading to Sion are in mourning because there is no one coming to her solemn feasts anymore.
All of her city gates are destroyed, and her priests are groaning.
Her young women are in squalor, and Sion herself is oppressed with utter bitterness.

(Lamentations 1:5) 
Her enemies have become her masters, and her foes have become rich.
This has happened because the Lord Himself has brought judgment upon her due to the multitude of her sins.
Her little children have been led away into captivity before the very eyes of their tormentors.

(Lamentations 1:6) 
From the Daughter of Sion, all her beauty has now departed.
Her princes have become like rams who cannot find any pasture.
They have gone away, utterly without strength, before the face of their pursuers.

(Lamentations 1:7) 
Jerusalem now remembers the days of her affliction and her transgressions against God.
She remembers all the precious things she had from ancient times.
She remembers when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and there was no one to help them.
Her enemies saw her and openly mocked her Sabbaths, which she could no longer keep.

(Lamentations 1:8) 
Jerusalem has sinned terribly, which is why she has become unstable and wandering.
All those who used to glorify her now scorn her, because they have seen her disgrace.
She herself is groaning and has turned away in shame.

(Lamentations 1:9) 
Her defilement is on her very feet, and she did not remember what her end would be.
She has been violently cast down, having no one to comfort her.
O Lord, look upon my affliction, for the enemy has risen up against me.

(Lamentations 1:10) 
The enemy has stretched out his hand to seize all of her most precious things.
For she has seen the Gentiles enter her sanctuary,
â€”those very nations whom You had commanded should never enter into Your holy assembly.

(Lamentations 1:11) 
All of her people are now groaning as they search for bread.
They have given up all their precious possessions in exchange for food, just to keep themselves alive.
O Lord, look and consider this, for I have become worthless.

(Lamentations 1:12) 
O, all you who pass by on this road, pay attention and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow!
For the Lord has afflicted me, as He promised, on the very day of His fierce and burning anger.

(Lamentations 1:13) 
From His exalted dwelling, God sent fire down into my very bones, and He chastised me.
He spread a net for my feet and made me stumble backward.
He has made me desolate, utterly consumed with sorrow all the day long.

(Lamentations 1:14) 
The heavy yoke of my sins has been fastened upon me; they have been intertwined by His hand and placed upon my neck.
My strength has completely failed.
The Lord has delivered me into a hand from which I will never be able to rise.

(Lamentations 1:15) 
The Lord has taken away all my mighty men from among me.
He has called for a specific time to come against me, so that He might crush my valiant men.
The Lord has trodden the winepress upon the virgin daughter of Judah, crushing her utterly.

(Lamentations 1:16) 
Therefore, I weep continuously, and my eyes pour out tears.
For the Comforter, who could restore my soul, has gone far from me.
My children have become desolate because the enemy has utterly prevailed.

(Lamentations 1:17) 
Sion stretches out her hands for help, but there is no one to comfort her.
The Lord has commanded her enemies to surround Jacob, so they are all around her.
Jerusalem has become like an unclean woman among them, utterly despised.

(Lamentations 1:18) 
The Lord is truly just in His judgment, for I have provoked His divine will to anger.
Listen, I beg you, all peoples, and see my great sorrow!
My young women and my young men have been led away into captivity.

(Lamentations 1:19) 
I called upon my friends, but they themselves deceived me.
My priests and my elders perished within the city,
because they were desperately searching for food to keep themselves alive.

(Lamentations 1:20) 
O Lord, look upon me, for I am in severe distress.
My innermost being is in turmoil; my heart is utterly overturned within me, for I am filled with overwhelming bitterness.
Outside the city, the sword has brought death, and inside my home, it feels just like death.

(Lamentations 1:21) 
They have heard that I am groaning, and there is no one to comfort me.
All my enemies have heard of my misfortune, and they rejoiced that You, O God, have done this.
You have brought their day of reckoning, and they will become just like me in their suffering.

(Lamentations 1:22) 
Let all their wickedness come before Your sight, O God.
And punish them just as You have punished me, because of all my many sins.
For my groans are many, and my heart is filled with sorrow.

(Lamentations 2:1) 
How the Lord, in His fury, has covered the Daughter of Zion with darkness, casting down from its exalted position to the ground the renown of Israel! In the day of His anger, He did not even remember His holy footstool, the Temple.

(Lamentations 2:2) 
The Lord has cast down and shown no mercy to all the glorious places of Jacob. In His fury, He destroyed the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah, leveling them to the ground. He has defiled both the kingdom and its leaders.

(Lamentations 2:3) 
In the blazing anger of His fury, He broke every source of Israel's strength. He withdrew His powerful right hand from the sight of the enemy, and He set Jacob ablaze like a devouring fire that consumed everything around it.

(Lamentations 2:4) 
Like an enemy, He drew His bow. He stood firm with His right hand like an adversary, and He killed everything beautiful to behold in the dwellings of Zion. He poured out His indignation like a raging fire.

(Lamentations 2:5) 
The Lord acted like an enemy; He utterly destroyed Israel. He destroyed all its walls and demolished its strongholds. And in Zion, He brought a time of mourning for both its outer walls and its inner ramparts.

(Lamentations 2:6) 
He has torn down His protective hedge as one would a garden wall. He has demolished His own dwelling place, the Temple. The Lord has made all the feast days and Sabbaths in Zion to cease. And in His fierce indignation, He has rejected both king and priest.

(Lamentations 2:7) 
The Lord has rejected His own altar. He has cursed His sanctuary, delivering the walls of its towers into the hands of the enemy. The enemies now shout in the House of the Lord, as if it were a feast day of their own celebration.

(Lamentations 2:8) 
The Lord planned to tear down the wall of the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out His measuring line for destruction and did not withdraw His hand from the task until it was complete. The outer wall mourned, and the city wall was utterly destroyed with it.

(Lamentations 2:9) 
Its gates are buried deep in the ground. He broke and shattered all its defensive bars. Its king and its princes are now exiled among the foreign nations. There is no Law of God observed, and its prophets no longer receive a vision from the Lord.

(Lamentations 2:10) 
The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit silently on the ground. They have sprinkled ashes on their heads and clothed themselves in sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground in despair.

(Lamentations 2:11) 
My eyes are consumed with weeping, and my inner being is deeply troubled. My life essence feels poured out onto the ground because of the utter destruction of the Daughter of my people, as I see little children and infants fainting in the streets of the city.

(Lamentations 2:12) 
The children cried to their mothers, 'Where is bread and wine?' as they fainted like wounded soldiers in the city streets, and breathed their last breath in their mothers' arms.

(Lamentations 2:13) 
To what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, or how can I comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? For your destruction is as vast as the sea; who can possibly heal you?

(Lamentations 2:14) 
Your prophets saw for you false and foolish visions. They did not expose your iniquity to provoke you to repentance. Instead, they saw for you false burdens and misleading delusions.

(Lamentations 2:15) 
All who pass by the way clap their hands in scorn over you. They hiss and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem, saying, 'Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?'

(Lamentations 2:16) 
All your enemies open their mouths wide against you. They hiss and gnash their teeth, saying, 'We have utterly devoured her! Behold, this is the day we have waited for; we have found it, we have seen it with our own eyes!'

(Lamentations 2:17) 
The Lord has done what He purposed; He has fulfilled the word He spoke from ancient days. He has destroyed without sparing, and He has made your enemy rejoice over you. He has exalted the strength of your adversaries.

(Lamentations 2:18) 
Their hearts cry out to the Lord over the walls of the Daughter of Zion: 'Let your tears flow like a torrent day and night. Do not give yourself any rest, and let the stream of your tears never cease!'

(Lamentations 2:19) 
Arise! Cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches. Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to Him for the lives of your little children, who are fainting from hunger at every street corner.

(Lamentations 2:20) 
Look, O Lord, and consider how You have utterly ravaged us. Shall women really eat their own children, the fruit of their own bodies? Shall priest and prophet be put to death in the very sanctuary of the Lord?

(Lamentations 2:21) 
The young child and the old man lie on the ground, lifeless. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of Your fury; You struck them down without any mercy.

(Lamentations 2:22) 
As if for a solemn feast day, You called forth my terrors from every side. In the day of the Lord's fury, no one escaped or was left alive. Those children whom I had lovingly raised and nourished, my enemy has utterly consumed them all.

(Lamentations 3:1) 
I am the man who has seen my own utter misery, inflicted by the rod of God's righteous anger.

(Lamentations 3:2) 
God has led me and brought me into spiritual darkness, and not into His light.

(Lamentations 3:3) 
God has continually turned His hand against me, all day long.

(Lamentations 3:4) 
He has stripped away my skin and my flesh, and broken my bones, leaving me utterly vulnerable.

(Lamentations 3:5) 
He has built a wall around me, and surrounded me with bitter affliction and great suffering.

(Lamentations 3:6) 
He has placed me in the deepest darkness, like those who have been dead for a long time.

(Lamentations 3:7) 
He has walled me in completely so that I cannot escape; He has made my chains heavy and unbreakable.

(Lamentations 3:8) 
And even when I cry out and pray for help, God has shut out my prayers.

(Lamentations 3:9) 
He has blocked my paths with massive, squared stones, and made my ways impossible to navigate.

(Lamentations 3:10) 
God has become to me like a bear lying in ambush, or a lion hidden in wait.

(Lamentations 3:11) 
He has completely overturned my life's paths and broken me; He has left me utterly desolate and alone.

(Lamentations 3:12) 
He has drawn His bow and set me up as a target for His arrow.

(Lamentations 3:13) 
He has shot the arrows from His quiver deep into my vital organs.

(Lamentations 3:14) 
I have become the object of mockery for all my own people, and their song of scorn all day long.

(Lamentations 3:15) 
God has filled me with bitter experiences; He has made me drunk with the bitter poison of suffering.

(Lamentations 3:16) 
He has broken my teeth on gravel; He has made me eat ashes.

(Lamentations 3:17) 
My soul has been driven far away from any peace, and I have forgotten what good things feel like.

(Lamentations 3:18) 
And I said to myself, "My strength is completely gone, and all my hope from the Lord has vanished."

(Lamentations 3:19) 
Remember my profound suffering and my homeless wandering, the bitter poison and the gall of it all.

(Lamentations 3:20) 
I will always remember these things, and my soul will waste away within me because of it.

(Lamentations 3:21) 
But when I bring this to my mind, I then find strength.

(Lamentations 3:22) 
It is because of the Lordâ€™s mercies that we are not completely destroyed; His compassions never fail.

(Lamentations 3:23) 
They are new every morning, constantly renewed; indeed, Your faithfulness is great.

(Lamentations 3:24) 
My soul proclaims, "The Lord is my portion and inheritance, therefore I will wait in hope for Him."

(Lamentations 3:25) 
The Lord is truly good to those who wait for Him, to the soul that earnestly seeks Him.

(Lamentations 3:26) 
It is good to quietly wait and hope for the saving help of God.

(Lamentations 3:27) 
It is good for a person to bear the burden of suffering from their youth.

(Lamentations 3:28) 
The one who bears suffering will sit alone and remain silent, because he has accepted this burden upon himself.

(Lamentations 3:29) 
He will put his mouth in the dust, prostrating himself in utter humility, if by chance there is still hope.

(Lamentations 3:30) 
He will offer his cheek to the one who strikes him; he will allow himself to be filled with insults and shame.

(Lamentations 3:31) 
For the Lord will not cast off His people forever.

(Lamentations 3:32) 
For even if He has cast them away, He will show mercy according to the abundance of His compassion.

(Lamentations 3:33) 
For God does not willingly humble or cast away the children of mankind from His heart.

(Lamentations 3:34) 
He takes no pleasure in seeing those bound on earth crushed underfoot by oppressors.

(Lamentations 3:35) 
Nor does He approve when a person's justice is subverted in the presence of the Most High God.

(Lamentations 3:36) 
Nor does the Lord approve when a man is defrauded in his legal judgment.

(Lamentations 3:37) 
Who is it that has spoken a command and it came to be, when the Lord Himself had not commanded it?

(Lamentations 3:38) 
Does not both evil and good proceed from the mouth of the Most High God?

(Lamentations 3:39) 
Why then should any living person murmur or complain, especially a man who suffers for his own sins?

(Lamentations 3:40) 
Let us carefully examine our ways, and search our consciences, and then turn back to the Lord.

(Lamentations 3:41) 
Let us lift up our hearts, not just our hands, in prayer to the Lord who dwells in the spiritual heavens.

(Lamentations 3:42) 
We have acted wickedly and defiantly, and provoked You to anger; because of this, You have not spared us.

(Lamentations 3:43) 
You have covered Yourself with fury and pursued us; You have slain us without mercy.

(Lamentations 3:44) 
You have covered Yourself with a thick cloud so that no prayer can pass through to You.

(Lamentations 3:45) 
You have made us an object of scorn and contempt in the midst of the nations.

(Lamentations 3:46) 
All of our enemies have opened their mouths against us in derision.

(Lamentations 3:47) 
A terrifying report and destruction have come upon us; calamity and utter ruin.

(Lamentations 3:48) 
My eyes pour out rivers of tears because of the utter destruction of the daughter of my people.

(Lamentations 3:49) 
My eyes will continue to pour out tears and will not stop, because there is no rest or relief from this suffering.

(Lamentations 3:50) 
Until the Lord looks down and sees from His dwelling in the spiritual heavens.

(Lamentations 3:51) 
The sight of my city's suffering has deeply grieved my soul, because of all the people, the daughters of my city.

(Lamentations 3:52) 
My enemies have hunted me down like a bird, without any cause or reason.

(Lamentations 3:53) 
They trapped me alive in a pit, and placed a large stone over me.

(Lamentations 3:54) 
The waters closed over my head, and I said, "We are utterly lost and destroyed!"

(Lamentations 3:55) 
I called upon Your Holy Name, O Lord, from the lowest, most desperate pit.

(Lamentations 3:56) 
You heard my voice calling out; do not turn away Your ear from my groaning and my cries.

(Lamentations 3:57) 
You came near to me on the very day I called upon You; You said, "Do not be afraid."

(Lamentations 3:58) 
You have defended the cause of my soul, O Lord; You have redeemed my very life.

(Lamentations 3:59) 
You have seen, O Lord, the injustice done to me; now, give judgment on my behalf.

(Lamentations 3:60) 
You have seen all their acts of vengeance, and all their evil thoughts against me.

(Lamentations 3:61) 
You have heard their insults, O Lord, and all their malicious plots against me.

(Lamentations 3:62) 
You know the hostile words of those who rise up against me, and their wicked thoughts against me all day long.

(Lamentations 3:63) 
Observe their every action, whether they are sitting or rising; I am the constant subject of their mocking songs.

(Lamentations 3:64) 
You will repay them, O Lord, according to the evil works of their own hands.

(Lamentations 3:65) 
You will give them hardness of heart as a punishment, and Your curse will be upon them.

(Lamentations 3:66) 
You will pursue them in Your wrath and utterly destroy them under Your created universe, O Lord.

(Lamentations 4:1) 
How the gold has grown dim! How the finest color has changed! The precious stones of the sanctuary are scattered at the head of every street, desecrated and lost.

(Lamentations 4:2) 
The glorious sons of Sion, once adorned in the finest gold, how they are now esteemed as mere earthen vessels, like common pottery made by a potter's hands!

(Lamentations 4:3) 
Even the wild animals, like jackals, bare their breasts and nurse their young. But the daughter of my people, out of desperation, has become cruel, like an ostrich in the desert that abandons its eggs.

(Lamentations 4:4) 
The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of its mouth from unbearable thirst. Little children beg for bread, but there is no one to break it and give it to them.

(Lamentations 4:5) 
Those who used to eat luxuriously have perished in the streets from hunger. Those who were brought up in scarlet robes now embrace dung heaps out of sheer starvation.

(Lamentations 4:6) 
The punishment for the iniquity of the daughter of my people has become greater and more prolonged than the sin of Sodom. Sodom was overthrown in a moment, its destruction was swift and complete, with no human hands laying hold of it for further torment.

(Lamentations 4:7) 
Her Nazirites, who once were purer than snow and whiter than milk, more ruddy than ancient ivory, and more beautiful than sapphires,

(Lamentations 4:8) 
now have faces darker than charcoal. They are not recognized in their own streets. Their skin clings to their bones, shriveled and become dry like wood.

(Lamentations 4:9) 
Those killed by the sword were better off than those killed by famine, for the latter wasted away, consumed by the utter barrenness of the land.

(Lamentations 4:10) 
The hands of even compassionate women have cooked their own children. These children became their food during the destruction and heartbreak of the daughter of my people.

(Lamentations 4:11) 
The Lord has fully accomplished His fury; He has poured out the wrath of His indignation. He kindled a devastating fire in Zion, and it devoured even her very foundations.

(Lamentations 4:12) 
The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world could not believe that an enemy and an adversary would ever enter through the gates of Jerusalem, a city thought to be impregnable.

(Lamentations 4:13) 
This disaster came because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst.

(Lamentations 4:14) 
They, the defiled priests and prophets, wandered like blind men in the streets, so stained with blood that they became ritually impure. And when they could not avoid it, they defiled others even by touching them with their garments.

(Lamentations 4:15) 
'Depart, you who are defiled!' people cried out to them. 'Depart, depart, do not touch!' Indeed, they were consumed by wrath and wasted away. The nations said among themselves: 'They, the people of God, will no longer dwell among them here.'

(Lamentations 4:16) 
The very presence of the Lord has scattered them; He will no longer look upon them with favor. He showed no regard for the priests, nor did He pity the elders, no matter their former status.

(Lamentations 4:17) 
While we still had a little life left, our eyes failed, constantly looking for our vain help. We watched intently for a foreign nation that could not possibly save us.

(Lamentations 4:18) 
Our enemies hunted our steps so that we could not walk in our own streets. Our end drew near, our days were fulfilled, for our ultimate destruction had come.

(Lamentations 4:19) 
Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the sky. They pursued us relentlessly over the mountains, and they lay in wait for us in the barren desert.

(Lamentations 4:20) 
Our very breath of life, the Lord's Anointed King, was captured because of our sins. He, in whom we had placed our hope, to whom we had said: 'Under your shadow, we shall live safely among the nations.'

(Lamentations 4:21) 
Rejoice and be glad for now, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. But beware, to you also the cup of God's wrath shall pass; you shall be made drunk with judgment and stripped bare in humiliation.

(Lamentations 4:22) 
Your punishment is now complete, O daughter of Zion; the Lord will no longer cause you to go into exile. But He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, and He will fully uncover your sins.

(Lamentations 5:1) 
Remember, Lord, what has happened to us. Look upon us and truly see our deep disgrace.

(Lamentations 5:2) 
Our inheritance, the land God gave us, has been given to strangers. Our homes have been taken by foreigners.

(Lamentations 5:3) 
We have become like orphans, completely abandoned by our father. Our mothers are like widows, left alone and unprotected.

(Lamentations 5:4) 
We have to buy even our own water to drink. We must pay a high price for our own wood to burn.

(Lamentations 5:5) 
We are constantly under threat, with the enemy's yoke on our necks. Even when we are exhausted, there is no rest for us.

(Lamentations 5:6) 
We were forced to seek help and make alliances with Egypt and Assyria, just so we could get enough bread to eat.

(Lamentations 5:7) 
Our fathers sinned greatly, and now they are gone from this earth. But we, their children, are left to carry the heavy burden of their wickedness.

(Lamentations 5:8) 
We are ruled by mere servants, who have no right to govern us. There was no one who could rescue us from their cruel grasp.

(Lamentations 5:9) 
We had to go out into the desolate wilderness, risking our very lives to find bread, facing the constant threat of the enemy's sword.

(Lamentations 5:10) 
Our skin has become as dark and cracked as a baking oven, scorched by the ravaging heat of famine and disease.

(Lamentations 5:11) 
They violated the women in Jerusalem, the holy city. They violently dishonored the virgins in the towns throughout the land of Judah.

(Lamentations 5:12) 
Our respected leaders were brutally hanged, left to die by their hands. The faces of our elders were shown no reverence or mercy; they were not ashamed to dishonor them.

(Lamentations 5:13) 
They forced our young men to do the heavy labor of grinding grain. Even young boys collapsed under the burden of carrying heavy loads of wood.

(Lamentations 5:14) 
The wise elders no longer sit at the city gates to offer counsel. Our young men are gone from the joyful choirs of praise.

(Lamentations 5:15) 
The joy in our hearts has utterly vanished. Our festive dances have turned into bitter mourning.

(Lamentations 5:16) 
The crown of our glory has fallen from our headsâ€”our honor and our rule are gone. Woe to us! All this has happened because we have sinned against God.

(Lamentations 5:17) 
Because of this profound loss, our hearts are filled with sorrow. Our eyes are now dimmed, darkened by endless tears and despair.

(Lamentations 5:18) 
All this suffering has come upon us because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate and burned. Wild foxes now roam freely where our holy Temple once stood.

(Lamentations 5:19) 
But You, O Lord, remain on Your throne forever. Your sovereign rule endures through every single generation.

(Lamentations 5:20) 
Why would You forget us forever, O Lord? Will You abandon us for the rest of our days, leaving us in this endless sorrow?

(Lamentations 5:21) 
Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will truly turn. Make our lives new again, restoring our days as they were in the beginning of our history.

(Lamentations 5:22) 
It cannot be that You have completely rejected us, can it? Or is Your anger against us simply too great to ever relent?
