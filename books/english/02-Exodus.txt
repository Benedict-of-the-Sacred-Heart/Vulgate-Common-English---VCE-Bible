(Exodus 1:1) 
These are the names of the sons of Israel who migrated into Egypt with Jacob, each one entering with his own household:

(Exodus 1:2) 
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,

(Exodus 1:3) 
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

(Exodus 1:4) 
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

(Exodus 1:5) 
All the descendants who came forth from Jacob were seventy in number, counting Jacob himself; Joseph, however, was already residing in Egypt.

(Exodus 1:6) 
And so Joseph died, and all of his brothers, and all that entire generation of his relatives passed away.

(Exodus 1:7) 
But the sons of Israel grew greatly in numbers, multiplying like seeds sown in the earth; they filled the entire land of Egypt.

(Exodus 1:8) 
In the meantime, a new king arose over Egypt, one who did not know or remember Joseph's contributions and legacy.

(Exodus 1:9) 
He spoke to his own people, saying, 'Look, the nation of the sons of Israel is numerous, and they are becoming stronger than we are.'

(Exodus 1:10) 
Come, let us deal cunningly with them, lest they multiply further, and if war breaks out against us, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and then depart from our land entirely.

(Exodus 1:11) 
Therefore, the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over them to oppress the Israelites with heavy burdens. The Israelites then built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.

(Exodus 1:12) 
But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and grew. This caused the Egyptians to despise the sons of Israel even more,

(Exodus 1:13) 
and they afflicted them with harsh servitude in every kind of work.

(Exodus 1:14) 
They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks, and with all types of forced labor in the fields, imposing every kind of heavy agricultural work upon them.

(Exodus 1:15) 
Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives—one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other Puah—

(Exodus 1:16) 
commanding them: 'When you attend to the Hebrew women in childbirth, and the time for delivery comes: if it is a son, you must kill him; but if it is a daughter, you may let her live.'

(Exodus 1:17) 
However, the midwives feared God more than the king. They did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but allowed the male children to live.

(Exodus 1:18) 
So the king summoned the midwives and asked them, 'Why have you done this, allowing the male children to live?'

(Exodus 1:19) 
They answered Pharaoh: 'The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are strong and give birth quickly, and they have already delivered before we midwives can even arrive to assist them.'

(Exodus 1:20) 
Therefore, God dealt kindly with the midwives and blessed them; and the people of Israel continued to increase and grew exceedingly strong.

(Exodus 1:21) 
And because the midwives feared God, He built up their households and gave them families of their own.

(Exodus 1:22) 
So Pharaoh then gave a command to all his people, saying, 'Every son who is born to the Hebrews, you must throw into the Nile River; but every daughter, you may let live.'

(Exodus 2:1) 
A man from the tribe of Levi married a woman from the very same tribe of Levi.

(Exodus 2:2) 
She conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a healthy and beautiful child, she hid him for three months.

(Exodus 2:3) 
When she could no longer hide him, she took a basket made of reeds and waterproofed it with tar and pitch. She placed the baby in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the river.

(Exodus 2:4) 
And the baby's sister stood at a distance, watching to see what would happen to him.

(Exodus 2:5) 
Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to bathe in the river, while her attendants walked along the river's bank. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent one of her servants to get it. When the basket was brought to her and opened, she saw the crying baby inside. She felt compassion for him and said, "This is one of the Hebrew children."

(Exodus 2:6) 
Then the baby's sister spoke to Pharaoh's daughter, "Do you want me to go and call a Hebrew nurse for you, so she can nurse the baby for you?"

(Exodus 2:7) 
Pharaoh's daughter replied, "Go." So the girl went and called the baby's mother.

(Exodus 2:8) 
Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.

(Exodus 2:9) 
When the child had grown up, his mother gave him back to Pharaoh's daughter. She adopted him as her own son and named him Moses, explaining that she had drawn him out of the water.

(Exodus 2:10) 
In those days, after a long time had passed, Moses went out to his people, the Hebrews. He saw their suffering and watched an Egyptian man striking one of his Hebrew kinsmen.

(Exodus 2:11) 
He looked around carefully, and when he saw no one else was around, he struck down the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.

(Exodus 2:12) 
The next day, when Moses went out again, he saw two Hebrew men quarreling. He said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you striking your fellow man?"

(Exodus 2:13) 
The man replied, "Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" Moses became afraid and said to himself, "How did this deed become known?"

(Exodus 2:14) 
When Pharaoh heard this report, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh's presence and settled in the land of Midian, sitting by a well.

(Exodus 2:15) 
The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water and fill the watering troughs to water their father's flock.

(Exodus 2:16) 
Other shepherds would often come and drive them away from the well. But Moses rose to their defense, and after drawing water himself, he watered their sheep for them.

(Exodus 2:17) 
When they returned to Reuel, their father, he asked them, "Why have you come back sooner than usual today?"

(Exodus 2:18) 
They answered, "An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds and even drew water for us, then watered our sheep."

(Exodus 2:19) 
Reuel said, "Where is he now? Why did you leave him there? Go and invite him to come eat a meal with us."

(Exodus 2:20) 
So Moses agreed and swore to stay with Reuel. Reuel then gave Zipporah, his daughter, to be Moses' wife.

(Exodus 2:21) 
She bore him a son, whom Moses named Gershom, explaining that he had been a sojourner in a foreign land.

(Exodus 2:22) 
Later, she bore another son, whom Moses named Eliezer, saying, "For the God of my father has been my helper, and delivered me from Pharaoh's hand."

(Exodus 2:23) 
After a very long time, the king of Egypt died. But the children of Israel continued to groan under their oppressive labor. They cried out, and their cry for help from their labor went up to God.

(Exodus 2:24) 
God heard their groaning and remembered His solemn covenant that He had established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Exodus 2:25) 
The Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and He truly acknowledged their plight.

(Exodus 3:1) 
Moses was shepherding the sheep belonging to Jethro, his father-in-law, who was the priest of Midian. He led the flock deep into the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.

(Exodus 3:2) 
Then the Lord God appeared to him in a flame of fire coming out of the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was burning with fire, yet it was not consumed or destroyed.

(Exodus 3:3) 
And Moses said to himself: "I will go and see this great sight, to understand why the bush does not burn away."

(Exodus 3:4) 
When the Lord saw that Moses was moving closer to investigate, God called to him from the middle of the bush, saying: "Moses, Moses!" And Moses answered: "Here I am."

(Exodus 3:5) 
Then God said: "Do not come any closer here. Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."

(Exodus 3:6) 
He continued: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses covered his face because he did not dare to look directly at God.

(Exodus 3:7) 
And the Lord God said: "I have clearly seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of the harshness of those who are over them in their work. I know their pain,

(Exodus 3:8) 
and so I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians and to lead them out of that land into a good and spacious land—a land flowing with milk and honey. This is the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

(Exodus 3:9) 
The cry of the children of Israel has indeed reached me, and I have seen how the Egyptians oppress them.

(Exodus 3:10) 
Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may lead my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

(Exodus 3:11) 
And Moses said to God: "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the children of Israel out of Egypt?"

(Exodus 3:12) 
God said: "I will be with you. And this will be the sign that I have sent you: When you have led the people out of Egypt, you will offer sacrifice to God on this very mountain."

(Exodus 3:13) 
Moses then said to God: "Look, when I go to the children of Israel and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is His name?'—what shall I tell them?"

(Exodus 3:14) 
God said to Moses: "I AM WHO I AM." He added: "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'The One Who Is—has sent me to you.'"

(Exodus 3:15) 
God also said to Moses: "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.

(Exodus 3:16) 
Go and gather the elders of Israel. Tell them: 'The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have indeed visited you and seen everything that has happened to you in Egypt.

(Exodus 3:17) 
And I have said that I will lead you out of the afflictions of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'

(Exodus 3:18) 
They will listen to your voice. Then you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and tell him: 'The Lord God of the Hebrews has summoned us. Let us go on a journey of three days into the wilderness, so that we may offer sacrifice to the Lord our God.'

(Exodus 3:19) 
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless it is by a mighty hand.

(Exodus 3:20) 
For I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders, which I will perform in their midst. And after these things, he will let you go.

(Exodus 3:21) 
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that when you depart, you will not leave empty-handed.

(Exodus 3:22) 
Instead, you will plunder the Egyptians. You will take from them silver articles and gold articles, and clothing. You will put these upon your sons and your daughters, and thus you will strip Egypt of its riches.

(Exodus 4:1) 
Moses answered the Lord, saying: "They will not believe me, nor will they listen to what I say. Instead, they will insist: 'The Lord never appeared to you.'"

(Exodus 4:2) 
The Lord then asked Moses: "What is that you are holding in your hand?" Moses answered: "A staff."

(Exodus 4:3) 
And the Lord said: "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it down, and it turned into a serpent. Moses immediately fled from it.

(Exodus 4:4) 
Then the Lord said: "Reach out your hand and grasp its tail." Moses stretched out his hand, seized it, and held it. The serpent then returned to being a staff in his hand.

(Exodus 4:5) 
The Lord said: "Do this so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has truly appeared to you."

(Exodus 4:6) 
The Lord spoke again, saying: "Now, put your hand inside your cloak." When Moses placed his hand inside, he pulled it out, and it was leprous, white as snow.

(Exodus 4:7) 
And He said: "Put your hand back into your cloak." Moses put it back, and when he drew it out of his cloak, it was restored, just like his other flesh.

(Exodus 4:8) 
The Lord said: "If they do not believe you, nor listen to the message of the first sign, they will then believe the message of the second sign."

(Exodus 4:9) 
"But if they do not believe even these two signs, nor listen to your voice, then take water from the river and pour it on the dry ground. What you draw from the river will turn into blood."

(Exodus 4:10) 
Moses said: "Oh, please, Lord! I am not an eloquent speaker. I haven't been from yesterday, nor the day before, and not even since you began speaking to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."

(Exodus 4:11) 
The Lord said to him: "Who gave humans their mouths? Or who made them mute or deaf, or able to see or blind? Was it not I, the Lord?"

(Exodus 4:12) 
"Now, go! I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you are to say."

(Exodus 4:13) 
But Moses replied: "Oh, please, Lord! Send someone else to whom you intend to send."

(Exodus 4:14) 
The Lord became angry with Moses and said: "Is not Aaron, your brother, a Levite? I know that he is eloquent. Look, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad."

(Exodus 4:15) 
"Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will show both of you what you must do."

(Exodus 4:16) 
"He will speak for you to the people, and he will be your mouth. You, in turn, will be like God for him, guiding him in what pertains to God."

(Exodus 4:17) 
"Also, take this staff in your hand, with which you will perform the miraculous signs."

(Exodus 4:18) 
Moses went and returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him: "I need to go back to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive." Jethro said to him: "Go in peace."

(Exodus 4:19) 
The Lord then said to Moses in Midian: "Go, and return to Egypt, for all those who sought to kill you are dead."

(Exodus 4:20) 
So Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon a donkey. He returned to Egypt, carrying the staff of God in his hand.

(Exodus 4:21) 
And the Lord said to Moses: "When you return to Egypt, be sure to perform all the wonders that I have put in your power before Pharaoh. However, I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go."

(Exodus 4:22) 
"And you shall say to him: 'Thus says the Lord: Israel is My firstborn son.'"

(Exodus 4:23) 
"'Let My son go, so that he may serve Me. If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'"

(Exodus 4:24) 
It came to pass on the way, at a lodging place, that the Lord met Moses and intended to kill him.

(Exodus 4:25) 
Immediately, Zipporah took a sharp flint knife and circumcised the foreskin of her son. She then touched Moses' feet with it and said: "You are a bridegroom of blood to me."

(Exodus 4:26) 
So the Lord departed from him. For after she spoke the words "bridegroom of blood," the Lord immediately let him go.

(Exodus 4:27) 
And the Lord said to Aaron: "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So Aaron went, and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.

(Exodus 4:28) 
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all about the miraculous signs which He had commanded him to perform.

(Exodus 4:29) 
So Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel.

(Exodus 4:30) 
And Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had said to Moses, and he performed the miraculous signs before the people.

(Exodus 4:31) 
And the people believed. They heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and had seen their affliction, and they bowed down and worshipped.

(Exodus 5:1) 
After these events, Moses and Aaron came and spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: Release my people, so they may offer a sacrifice to me in the desert."

(Exodus 5:2) 
But Pharaoh replied, "Who is the Lord that I should listen to His voice and release Israel? I do not know the Lord, and I will not release Israel."

(Exodus 5:3) 
Moses and Aaron said to him, "The God of the Hebrews has called upon us to go a three-day journey into the desert, to offer sacrifice to the Lord our God. We must do this, lest He strike us with plague or with the sword."

(Exodus 5:4) 
Pharaoh replied to them, "Why, Moses and Aaron, do you distract the people from their labors? Go back to your own burdens."

(Exodus 5:5) 
Pharaoh then said, "Look, the people of the land are numerous, as you can see. Think how much worse it will be if they stop working."

(Exodus 5:6) 
Therefore, on that very day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying:

(Exodus 5:7) 
"You will no longer give straw to the people for making bricks, as you did before. Instead, they must go and gather straw for themselves."

(Exodus 5:8) 
"And you will impose upon them the same quota of bricks that they previously made; you are not to reduce it in any way. For they are idle, and because of this, they cry out, saying, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'"

(Exodus 5:9) 
"Let the men's work be made heavier, and let them complete it; and let them not pay attention to false words."

(Exodus 5:10) 
So the taskmasters and foremen went out to the people and said, "Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw."

(Exodus 5:11) 
"Go yourselves and gather straw wherever you can find it. Nevertheless, your quota of the former work will not be reduced at all."

(Exodus 5:12) 
So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather straw.

(Exodus 5:13) 
And the taskmasters urged them on, saying, "Complete your daily work, just as before, when you were given straw."

(Exodus 5:14) 
So the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. The taskmasters asked them, "Why have you not completed the required number of bricks today, just as yesterday and the day before yesterday?"

(Exodus 5:15) 
Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you treat your servants in this manner?"

(Exodus 5:16) 
"Straw is not given to us, yet bricks are still demanded from us. Behold, your servants are beaten with whips, and we are treated unjustly."

(Exodus 5:17) 
Pharaoh replied, "You are idle, and because of this, you say, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to the Lord.'"

(Exodus 5:18) 
"Go now and work. Straw will not be given to you, but you must complete the required number of bricks."

(Exodus 5:19) 
The foremen of the sons of Israel saw themselves in trouble, because they were told, "Nothing will be reduced from the original number of bricks required each day."

(Exodus 5:20) 
And as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron, who were standing there waiting for them.

(Exodus 5:21) 
And they said to them, "May the Lord see and judge! For you have made our name foul before Pharaoh and his servants, and you have put a sword in their hands to kill us."

(Exodus 5:22) 
Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Lord, why have you afflicted this people? Why did you send me?"

(Exodus 5:23) 
"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has afflicted Your people, and You have not delivered them."

(Exodus 6:1) 
But the Lord said to Moses, "Now you will see what I am about to do to Pharaoh. For by My strong hand, Pharaoh will be compelled to drive the Israelites out, and with a mighty arm, he will expel them from his land."

(Exodus 6:2) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the Lord, God Almighty."

(Exodus 6:3) 
And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but My name, YHWH, in its full meaning and power, I did not fully reveal to them.

(Exodus 6:4) 
And I established My covenant with them, promising to give them the land of Canaan—the land where they lived as sojourners and strangers.

(Exodus 6:5) 
Therefore, I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered My covenant.

(Exodus 6:6) 
Therefore say to the children of Israel: 'I am the Lord, who will lead you out from under the heavy burdens imposed by the Egyptians. I will rescue you from slavery, and I will redeem you with My powerful, outstretched arm, and I will execute great judgments upon Egypt.'

(Exodus 6:7) 
And I will take you to Myself as My own people, and I will be your God. You will know for certain that I am the Lord your God, who has led you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

(Exodus 6:8) 
And I will bring you into the land for which I solemnly swore to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give that land to you as your possession. I am the Lord.

(Exodus 6:9) 
So Moses told all these things to the children of Israel, but they would not listen to him because of their deep discouragement and the harshness of their labor.

(Exodus 6:10) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses again, saying:

(Exodus 6:11) 
"Go and speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, telling him to let the children of Israel leave his land."

(Exodus 6:12) 
Moses replied before the Lord, "Look, the children of Israel themselves do not listen to me. So how will Pharaoh possibly listen to me, especially since I am a man of 'uncircumcised lips'—meaning my speech is ineffective or halting?"

(Exodus 6:13) 
And the Lord spoke to both Moses and Aaron, giving them a specific command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: that they were to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 6:14) 
These are the heads of the tribal families by their ancestral houses. The sons of Reuben, who was Israel's firstborn, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

(Exodus 6:15) 
These are the clans descended from Reuben. The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, who was the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families descended from Simeon.

(Exodus 6:16) 
And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their clans: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived for one hundred thirty-seven years.

(Exodus 6:17) 
The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their respective clans.

(Exodus 6:18) 
The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath himself lived for one hundred thirty-three years.

(Exodus 6:19) 
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi according to their family lines.

(Exodus 6:20) 
Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, as his wife. She bore him Aaron and Moses, as well as their sister Miriam. Amram lived for one hundred thirty-seven years.

(Exodus 6:21) 
The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.

(Exodus 6:22) 
The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.

(Exodus 6:23) 
Aaron took as his wife Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

(Exodus 6:24) 
The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the clans that descended from Korah.

(Exodus 6:25) 
Furthermore, Eleazar, Aaron's son, took a wife from the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levitical families according to their clans.

(Exodus 6:26) 
These are the very Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord gave the command to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, organized by their divisions.

(Exodus 6:27) 
These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. This refers to the very Moses and Aaron mentioned previously.

(Exodus 6:28) 
On the day that the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt—

(Exodus 6:29) 
—the Lord spoke to him, saying, "I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything that I tell you."

(Exodus 6:30) 
But Moses said before the Lord, "Look, I am a man of 'uncircumcised lips,' meaning my speech is ineffective. How then will Pharaoh possibly listen to me?"

(Exodus 7:1) 
The Lord said to Moses, "Listen, I have made you like a god to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet."

(Exodus 7:2) 
You will speak everything I command you, and Aaron, your brother, will speak for you, so that he may lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 7:3) 
But I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 7:4) 
He will not listen to you, so I will stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring out My army—My people, the children of Israel—from the land of Egypt through very great acts of judgment.

(Exodus 7:5) 
And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring the children of Israel out from among them.

(Exodus 7:6) 
So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded.

(Exodus 7:7) 
Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.

(Exodus 7:8) 
The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

(Exodus 7:9) 
"When Pharaoh says to you, 'Show a sign,' you will say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will turn into a serpent.'"

(Exodus 7:10) 
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it turned into a serpent.

(Exodus 7:11) 
But Pharaoh called for his wise men and his sorcerers. And the Egyptian magicians also did the same thing with their enchantments and secret arts.

(Exodus 7:12) 
For each of them threw down his staff, and they also turned into serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.

(Exodus 7:13) 
And Pharaoh's heart grew stubborn, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

(Exodus 7:14) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go."

(Exodus 7:15) 
"Go to Pharaoh in the morning. He will be going out to the waters—to the Nile River—and you will stand to meet him on the riverbank. Take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent."

(Exodus 7:16) 
"And you will say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying: "Let My people go, so that they may sacrifice to Me in the desert." But up until now, you have refused to listen.'"

(Exodus 7:17) 
"Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'By this, you will know that I am the Lord. Behold, I will strike the water of the river with the staff that is in My hand, and it will turn into blood.'"

(Exodus 7:18) 
"And the fish in the river will die, and the water will become foul and rot, and there will be a stench throughout Egypt. The Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river."

(Exodus 7:19) 
The Lord also said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, over their canals, over their marshes, and over all their pools of water—so that they may turn into blood. Let there be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in wooden vessels and in stone vessels.'"

(Exodus 7:20) 
So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. Aaron lifted up his staff and struck the waters of the river before Pharaoh and his servants, and all the waters of the river turned into blood.

(Exodus 7:21) 
And the fish that were in the river died, and the water became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink the water from the river. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 7:22) 
And the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments. So Pharaoh's heart grew stubborn again, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

(Exodus 7:23) 
And Pharaoh turned away and went into his house, and he did not even take this to heart this time.

(Exodus 7:24) 
But all the Egyptians dug wells around the river to get water to drink, for they could not drink the water from the river.

(Exodus 7:25) 
And seven days passed after the Lord struck the river.

(Exodus 7:26) 
The Lord said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says: Let My people go, so that they may sacrifice to Me.'"

(Exodus 7:27) 
"But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will strike all your territory with frogs."

(Exodus 7:28) 
"And the river will swarm with frogs, which will come up and enter your house, your bedroom, and your bed, and the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls."

(Exodus 7:29) 
"And the frogs will come up on you, and on your people, and on all your servants."

(Exodus 7:30) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the marshes, and bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt.'"

(Exodus 7:31) 
So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came out and covered all the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 7:32) 
And the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 7:33) 
Pharaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the Lord that He may remove the frogs from me and from my people. Then I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord."

(Exodus 7:34) 
Moses said to Pharaoh, "Set a time for me, when I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, so that the frogs may be driven away from you and from your houses and remain only in the river."

(Exodus 7:35) 
Pharaoh answered, "Tomorrow." And Moses said, "It will be as you say, so that you may know that there is no one else like the Lord our God."

(Exodus 7:36) 
"And the frogs will withdraw from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They will remain only in the river."

(Exodus 7:37) 
Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs, according to the promise he had made to Pharaoh.

(Exodus 7:38) 
And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died in the houses, in the villages, and in the fields.

(Exodus 7:39) 
And they gathered them together in immense heaps, and the land became foul with their stench.

(Exodus 7:40) 
But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, his heart grew stubborn, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

(Exodus 8:1) 
The Lord then gave Moses another command: "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the Lord declares: Let My people go so they can offer sacrifices to Me.'"

(Exodus 8:2) 
"But if you refuse to let them go, understand that I will strike all your territories with a plague of frogs."

(Exodus 8:3) 
The Nile River will swarm with frogs, and they will crawl out and enter your palace, your bedroom, and even your bed. They will invade the homes of your officials and your people, and get into your ovens and your kneading bowls where you prepare food.

(Exodus 8:4) 
The frogs will cover you, your people, and all your servants everywhere.

(Exodus 8:5) 
The Lord then told Moses, "Command Aaron: 'Stretch out your hand over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and bring forth the frogs upon the land of Egypt.'"

(Exodus 8:6) 
Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs emerged, covering the entire land of Egypt.

(Exodus 8:7) 
The Egyptian magicians, using their secret arts, also attempted to do the same and managed to bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt through their dark magic.

(Exodus 8:8) 
Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and pleaded with them: "Pray to the Lord to remove these frogs from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord."

(Exodus 8:9) 
Moses said to Pharaoh, "You name the time when I should pray for you, your servants, and your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your homes, remaining only in the Nile River."

(Exodus 8:10) 
Pharaoh replied, "Tomorrow." Moses then responded, "It will be according to your word, so you may know that there is no other God like the Lord our God."

(Exodus 8:11) 
"The frogs will be removed from you, your homes, your servants, and your people; they will remain only in the Nile River itself."

(Exodus 8:12) 
After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the plague of frogs that Pharaoh had agreed to have removed.

(Exodus 8:13) 
The Lord acted according to Moses' request: the frogs died in the houses, in the villages, and in the fields—everywhere they had been.

(Exodus 8:14) 
The Egyptians gathered them into enormous piles, and the land became foul with the stench of decaying frogs.

(Exodus 8:15) 
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief from the plague, he hardened his heart once again and refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had foretold.

(Exodus 8:16) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Command Aaron: 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become gnats throughout the entire land of Egypt.'"

(Exodus 8:17) 
They did as commanded. Aaron stretched out his hand, holding his staff, and struck the dust of the ground. Gnats then appeared on people and animals; all the dust of the ground was transformed into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.

(Exodus 8:18) 
The magicians also tried to produce gnats using their secret spells, but they could not. The gnats continued to infest both people and animals.

(Exodus 8:19) 
The magicians finally confessed to Pharaoh, "This is the very finger of God at work here." Yet Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn, and he refused to listen to them, just as the Lord had foretold.

(Exodus 8:20) 
The Lord then told Moses, "Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he goes out to the water—which he often did for religious rituals. Say to him: 'This is what the Lord declares: Let My people go so they can offer sacrifices to Me.'"

(Exodus 8:21) 
"But if you do not let My people go, then I will send swarms of various kinds of flies upon you, your officials, your people, and into your houses. The homes of the Egyptians will be filled with these swarms of flies, and the very ground where they stand will be covered with them."

(Exodus 8:22) 
"But on that day, I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people reside, so that no swarms of flies will be found there. This way you will know that I, the Lord, am present in the midst of this land."

(Exodus 8:23) 
"I will make a clear distinction between My people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow."

(Exodus 8:24) 
The Lord did exactly as He said: immense swarms of flies invaded Pharaoh's palace and his officials' homes, and the entire land of Egypt. The land was devastated by these swarms of flies.

(Exodus 8:25) 
Pharaoh then called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, "Go, and offer sacrifices to your God here within this land of Egypt."

(Exodus 8:26) 
Moses replied, "That cannot be done, because the sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God are an abomination to the Egyptians—they consider our sacred animals as idols. If we were to openly sacrifice what the Egyptians worship, they would surely stone us to death."

(Exodus 8:27) 
"We must travel three days into the wilderness and offer sacrifices to the Lord our God there, as He has commanded us to do."

(Exodus 8:28) 
Pharaoh then said, "I will indeed let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go too far. And be sure to pray for me."

(Exodus 8:29) 
Moses answered, "Look, I am leaving your presence now, and I will pray to the Lord that the swarms of flies may be removed from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people tomorrow. But let Pharaoh not deceive us again by refusing to let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord."

(Exodus 8:30) 
So Moses left Pharaoh's presence and prayed to the Lord.

(Exodus 8:31) 
The Lord acted according to Moses' word and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not a single fly remained.

(Exodus 8:32) 
But even on this occasion, Pharaoh hardened his heart and still refused to let the people go.

(Exodus 9:1) 
So Moses went in to Pharaoh and spoke to him, saying, "This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrew people, declares: Let My people go, so they can offer Me proper public worship."

(Exodus 9:2) 
But if you refuse to let them go, and you continue to detain them, then behold, My power will be against all your possessions: your fields, your horses, your donkeys, your camels, your cattle, and your sheep. A very severe plague of disease will strike them.

(Exodus 9:3) 
And the Lord will show a powerful distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians. Nothing belonging to the children of Israel will die from this disease.

(Exodus 9:4) 
The Lord set a specific time, saying, "Tomorrow the Lord will bring about this event in the land."

(Exodus 9:5) 
So the Lord did this the next day. All the animals belonging to the Egyptians died from the disease, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not a single one died.

(Exodus 9:6) 
Pharaoh sent servants to investigate, and indeed, not one of the animals belonging to Israel had died. But Pharaoh's heart became even more hardened, and he did not let the people go.

(Exodus 9:7) 
Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of ash from a furnace, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh."

(Exodus 9:8) 
And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt. It will turn into festering boils breaking out on people and animals throughout the entire land of Egypt.

(Exodus 9:9) 
So they took ash from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw it toward the sky, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.

(Exodus 9:10) 
The magicians, who used occult practices, could not even stand before Moses because of the boils that had broken out on them. The boils were on them and on all the people of Egypt.

(Exodus 9:11) 
And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had told Moses would happen.

(Exodus 9:12) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him: 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrew people, says: Let My people go, so they can offer Me proper public worship.'

(Exodus 9:13) 
For at this time I will send all My plagues against your heart, and against your servants, and against your people, so that you may know there is no one like Me in all the earth.

(Exodus 9:14) 
For if I had by now stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with the plague that killed the livestock, you would have been wiped off the earth completely.

(Exodus 9:15) 
But it is for this reason that I have preserved you and kept you alive—so that I may display My power in you, and that My Name may be proclaimed throughout all the earth.

(Exodus 9:16) 
You are still holding My people captive, and you refuse to let them go.

(Exodus 9:17) 
Listen: tomorrow, about this time, I will cause a very heavy hailstorm to fall, such as has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.

(Exodus 9:18) 
Therefore, send word now and gather your livestock and everything you have in the open fields. For every person and animal that is found outside and not brought under shelter will be struck by the hail, and they will die.

(Exodus 9:19) 
Those among Pharaoh's servants who feared the word of the Lord quickly brought their own servants and their livestock into their homes for shelter.

(Exodus 9:20) 
But those who disregarded the word of the Lord left their servants and their livestock out in the fields.

(Exodus 9:21) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that hail may fall throughout all the land of Egypt, upon people, upon animals, and upon every plant in the fields across the land of Egypt."

(Exodus 9:22) 
So Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the Lord sent thunder, and hail, and lightning flashed across the land. The Lord caused rain to fall heavily upon the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 9:23) 
There was hail, and fire was mingled with the hail. This hailstorm was so immense and destructive that nothing like it had ever appeared in all the land of Egypt since that nation was founded.

(Exodus 9:24) 
The hail struck down everything that was in the open fields throughout the entire land of Egypt, from people to animals. The hail also destroyed every plant in the region and shattered every tree in the fields.

(Exodus 9:25) 
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were living, did the hail not fall.

(Exodus 9:26) 
Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous and just, and I and my people are wicked."

(Exodus 9:27) 
Pray to the Lord, that He may stop these powerful thunders and this hail. I will let you go; you will not remain here any longer."

(Exodus 9:28) 
Moses replied, "As soon as I leave the city, I will stretch out my hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the Lord."

(Exodus 9:29) 
However, we know that neither you nor your servants truly fear the Lord God yet.

(Exodus 9:30) 
Thus, the hail and the lightning continued. This was because the barley and the flax crops were already in their growing season—the flax was in bloom, and the barley had already formed its heads.

(Exodus 9:31) 
But the wheat and the spelt were planted later in the season, and therefore they were not destroyed by the hail.

(Exodus 9:32) 
When Moses left Pharaoh's presence and went out of the city, he stretched out his hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder and hail ceased, and the heavy rain no longer poured down upon the earth.

(Exodus 9:33) 
But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, his heart became hardened once more. Both he and his servants became stubborn and unyielding.

(Exodus 9:34) 
So Pharaoh did not let the children of Israel go, just as the Lord had declared through Moses.

(Exodus 10:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Go in to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants stubborn, so that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them.'

(Exodus 10:2) 
and so that you may recount in the hearing of your sons and your grandsons how many times I have struck the Egyptians, and the miraculous signs that I have performed among them; and so that you may know that I am the Lord.'

(Exodus 10:3) 
Therefore, Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: "How long will you refuse to submit to Me? Let My people go, so that they may offer sacrifice to Me."'

(Exodus 10:4) 
'But if you still refuse to submit and will not let them go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locust into your lands.'

(Exodus 10:5) 
'These locusts will cover the surface of your land, so that nothing of it can be seen; and they will devour whatever remained after the hail, and whatever is left of your trees.'

(Exodus 10:6) 
'They will fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and of all the Egyptians. Such a plague has never been seen by your fathers or your grandfathers, from the day they were born upon the earth until this very day.' And then Moses turned and left Pharaoh's presence.

(Exodus 10:7) 
Pharaoh's servants then said to him: 'How long will we endure this scandal? Let the men go, so that they may offer sacrifice to the Lord their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is utterly ruined?'

(Exodus 10:8) 
So Moses and Aaron were called back to Pharaoh, and he said to them: 'Go, offer sacrifice to the Lord your God. But tell me, who exactly are those who will go?'

(Exodus 10:9) 
To him Moses replied: 'We will go with our young children and our elders, with our sons and our daughters, with all our sheep and our cattle; for it is a solemn feast of the Lord our God.'

(Exodus 10:10) 
Pharaoh replied: 'May the Lord be with you! As for me, in what way would I ever let you go, you and your little ones? Beware, for danger is imminent!'

(Exodus 10:11) 
'Not so! Only the men among you are to go and offer sacrifice to the Lord, for that is what you yourselves requested.' And Pharaoh's guards then drove them out from his presence.

(Exodus 10:12) 
The Lord then said to Moses: 'Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, and let the locusts come up upon it and devour all the vegetation of the land, whatever remained after the hail.'

(Exodus 10:13) 
So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt; and the Lord brought a scorching wind from the south throughout that entire day and night. And when morning came, the scorching wind carried the locusts.

(Exodus 10:14) 
The locusts covered the entire surface of Egypt, settling in all the regions of the Egyptians in such countless numbers that there had never been such a plague before that time, nor will there ever be one like it again.

(Exodus 10:15) 
Therefore, they devoured all the vegetation of the land, and whatever fruit was on the trees, and even the bark of the trees. Nothing green at all remained in all of Egypt, neither on the trees nor in the plants of the land.

(Exodus 10:16) 
For this reason, Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and he said: 'I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.'

(Exodus 10:17) 
'Now therefore, I beg you, forgive this wickedness of mine, and pray to the Lord your God, that He may at least take away this deadly plague from me.'

(Exodus 10:18) 
So Moses left Pharaoh's presence and prayed to the Lord.

(Exodus 10:19) 
And immediately the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea. Not even one locust remained in all the regions of Egypt.

(Exodus 10:20) 
But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he refused to let the children of Israel go.

(Exodus 10:21) 
The Lord then said to Moses: 'Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that there may be a darkness over the land of Egypt so dense that it can be felt.'

(Exodus 10:22) 
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and a horrible darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days.

(Exodus 10:23) 
No one could see his brother, nor did anyone move from the place where he was for three days. However, where the children of Israel were, there was light.

(Exodus 10:24) 
Pharaoh then called Moses and said: 'Go, offer sacrifice to the Lord. Only your sheep and your cattle must remain behind; your young children may go with you.'

(Exodus 10:25) 
Moses replied: 'No, you must also provide us with burnt offerings and sacrificial animals, which we may offer to the Lord our God.'

(Exodus 10:26) 
'We will take all our livestock with us; not a single hoof will remain. For it is necessary for us to take from them for the worship of the Lord our God, and we do not know exactly what will be pleasing to Him until we arrive at the appointed place.'

(Exodus 10:27) 
But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he refused to let them go.

(Exodus 10:28) 
Pharaoh then said to Moses: 'Get away from me! See to it that you never again seek my presence. On whatever day you appear before me again, you will surely die!'

(Exodus 10:29) 
To him Moses replied: 'As you have spoken, I will not see your face again.'

(Exodus 11:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying: 'There is one more plague I will send upon Pharaoh and Egypt. After this, Pharaoh will surely let you go. And when he finally lets you go, he will utterly drive you out of Egypt without delay.'

(Exodus 11:2) 
Therefore, speak to all the people of Israel, so that every man asks his Egyptian neighbor, and every woman asks her Egyptian female neighbor, for articles of silver and gold.

(Exodus 11:3) 
For the Lord will grant favor to His people in the sight of the Egyptians, so they will give them what they ask for. And Moses himself was a very great man in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh's servants and by all the people.

(Exodus 11:4) 
Then Moses declared: 'This is what the Lord says: About midnight tonight, I will go forth into the midst of Egypt.'

(Exodus 11:5) 
And every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die: from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits upon his throne, down to the firstborn son of the servant girl who grinds at the mill, and also all the firstborn of the livestock.

(Exodus 11:6) 
And there will be a great cry throughout the entire land of Egypt, such as has never been before, nor will there ever be again.

(Exodus 11:7) 
But among all the children of Israel, not even a dog will bark, neither against a human nor against an animal. This is so you may know with what great miracle the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.

(Exodus 11:8) 
And all these servants of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: 'Leave, you and all the people who are under your authority!' And only after this will I depart from Egypt.

(Exodus 11:9) 
The Lord had also said to Moses: 'Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that many of My wonders may be performed in the land of Egypt.'

(Exodus 11:10) 
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders that are written about, in the presence of Pharaoh. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel leave his land.

(Exodus 12:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron while they were in the land of Egypt:

(Exodus 12:2) 
"This month will be the beginning of your calendar months. It will be the first month of your year.

(Exodus 12:3) 
Tell the whole community of the Children of Israel: 'On the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family and for his household.

(Exodus 12:4) 
If the household is too small for a whole lamb, then the family and their nearest neighbor should share one, based on the number of people who can eat the lamb.

(Exodus 12:5) 
The lamb must be without blemish, a male, and one year old. You may choose it from either the sheep or the goats.

(Exodus 12:6) 
You must keep the lamb until the fourteenth day of this month. Then, the entire assembly of the Children of Israel will sacrifice it at twilight.

(Exodus 12:7) 
And they are to take some of its blood and put it on both doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat the lamb.

(Exodus 12:8) 
On that very night, they must eat the meat roasted over fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

(Exodus 12:9) 
Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water. It must be roasted over fire, including its head, legs, and internal organs.

(Exodus 12:10) 
You must not leave any of it until morning. If anything remains, you are to burn it with fire.

(Exodus 12:11) 
This is how you are to eat it: with your belts fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You must eat it quickly, because it is the Lord's Passover—meaning His passing over.

(Exodus 12:12) 
For on that very night, I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn son in Egypt, from the firstborn of humans to the firstborn of animals. And I will execute judgments against all the false gods of Egypt, for I am the Lord.

(Exodus 12:13) 
The blood on your houses will be a sign for you. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no destructive plague will touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 12:14) 
This day will be a memorial for you. You are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord throughout your generations, observing it as a perpetual ordinance.

(Exodus 12:15) 
For seven days, you must eat unleavened bread. On the very first day, you must remove all leaven from your houses. Anyone who eats anything leavened from the first day to the seventh day will be cut off from Israel.

(Exodus 12:16) 
The first day will be a holy and solemn assembly, and the seventh day will also be a solemn festival. You must not do any work on these days, except for what is necessary to prepare food for everyone.

(Exodus 12:17) 
You must observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. So you must keep this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.

(Exodus 12:18) 
In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day of that month, you must eat unleavened bread.

(Exodus 12:19) 
For seven days, no leaven is to be found in your houses. Anyone who eats anything leavened will be cut off from the community of Israel, whether they are a foreigner or a native-born Israelite.

(Exodus 12:20) 
You must not eat anything leavened. In all your dwelling places, you must eat unleavened bread."

(Exodus 12:21) 
Moses then called all the elders of the Children of Israel and said to them, "Go, select and take a lamb for your families, and sacrifice the Passover lamb.

(Exodus 12:22) 
Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of it to the lintel and both doorposts. And none of you shall go out the door of your house until morning.

(Exodus 12:23) 
For the Lord will pass through to strike the Egyptians. And when He sees the blood on the lintel and on both doorposts, the Lord will pass over that door and will not permit the Destroyer—God's instrument of judgment—to enter your houses to harm you.

(Exodus 12:24) 
You must observe this command as an ordinance for you and your children forever.

(Exodus 12:25) 
When you enter the land that the Lord will give you, as He promised, you must keep these ceremonies.

(Exodus 12:26) 
And when your children ask you, "What is the meaning of this religious service?"

(Exodus 12:27) 
You will tell them, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, because He passed over the houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians but spared our homes." Then the people bowed down and worshipped.

(Exodus 12:28) 
So the Children of Israel went and did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.

(Exodus 12:29) 
And it came to pass at the middle of that night, the Lord struck down every firstborn son in the land of Egypt—from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock.

(Exodus 12:30) 
Pharaoh rose up in the night, along with all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry throughout Egypt, for there was not a single house where there was not one dead.

(Exodus 12:31) 
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night and said, "Get up! Go out from among my people, both you and the Children of Israel. Go, worship the Lord as you have said.

(Exodus 12:32) 
Take your flocks and your herds, as you requested, and depart. And pray for me, too."

(Exodus 12:33) 
The Egyptians pressed the people to leave the land quickly, saying, "We will all die if you don't go!"

(Exodus 12:34) 
So the people took their dough before it was leavened, and binding their kneading bowls in their cloaks, they carried them on their shoulders.

(Exodus 12:35) 
The Children of Israel had also done as Moses commanded: they had asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for many garments.

(Exodus 12:36) 
And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so they gave them what they asked for. Thus, the Israelites plundered the Egyptians.

(Exodus 12:37) 
The Children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.

(Exodus 12:38) 
A mixed multitude of countless others also went up with them, along with a vast amount of flocks and herds and very much wealth.

(Exodus 12:39) 
And they baked unleavened cakes from the dough they had brought out of Egypt, for it could not be leavened. This was because the Egyptians had forced them to leave so suddenly, not allowing them to delay or prepare anything else.

(Exodus 12:40) 
Now, the dwelling of the Children of Israel, the time they had lived in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

(Exodus 13:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Exodus 13:2) 
“Consecrate to Me every firstborn male among the sons of Israel, whether human or animal, the first to be born from a mother’s womb; for all of them belong to Me and are Mine.”

(Exodus 13:3) 
Moses then said to the people: “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, from the house of slavery; because the Lord brought you out of that place with a strong hand, and therefore you shall not eat any leavened bread.”

(Exodus 13:4) 
“Today you are leaving, in the month of new harvests,” (which is the month of Aviv, or Nisan, marking the beginning of the religious calendar).

(Exodus 13:5) 
“And when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—the land He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall observe this rite of sacred feasts in this very month.”

(Exodus 13:6) 
“For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn feast of the Lord.”

(Exodus 13:7) 
“Only unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor any leaven in all your territory.”

(Exodus 13:8) 
“And you shall explain to your son on that day, saying: ‘This is done because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt, as a remembrance of His great works.’”

(Exodus 13:9) 
“And this feast shall be like a sign on your hand, and like a reminder before your eyes, so that the law of the Lord may always be on your lips and in your mind; for the Lord brought you out of Egypt with a strong, powerful hand.”

(Exodus 13:10) 
“You shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time, from year to year.”

(Exodus 13:11) 
“And when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, just as He swore to you and to your fathers, and has given it to you:”

(Exodus 13:12) 
“You shall set apart to the Lord every firstborn male, every first offspring that opens the womb, dedicating them as consecrated to the Lord.”

(Exodus 13:13) 
“Every firstborn of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep; but if you do not redeem it, you shall break its neck to put it to death. And every firstborn human of your sons you shall redeem by paying a price.”

(Exodus 13:14) 
“When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall answer him: ‘With a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.’”

(Exodus 13:15) 
“‘For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man even to the firstborn of animals. Because of this, I sacrifice to the Lord every firstborn male that opens the womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons by paying a price.’”

(Exodus 13:16) 
“‘And it shall be like a sign on your hand and like a memorial between your eyes, because the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong, powerful hand.’”

(Exodus 13:17) 
So when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, though that was the shortest and nearest route; for God said, 'Lest perhaps the people change their minds if they see war, and return to Egypt.'

(Exodus 13:18) 
Instead, God led them around by way of the desert toward the Red Sea. So the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for battle, carrying their weapons.

(Exodus 13:19) 
Moses also took the bones of Joseph with him; because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying: 'God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land, so you must carry my bones with you from here.'

(Exodus 13:20) 
Then they moved on from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.

(Exodus 13:21) 
And the Lord went before them, to show them the way by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire, so that He might be their guide for the journey at both times.

(Exodus 13:22) 
The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never departed from before all the people, always guiding them.

(Exodus 14:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Exodus 14:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel: Tell them to turn back and make camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, opposite Baal-zephon. They must camp by the sea there.”

(Exodus 14:3) 
“Pharaoh will then say about the children of Israel: ‘They are lost and wandering aimlessly in the land, and the desert has trapped them in.’”

(Exodus 14:4) 
“And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue you. I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.” The children of Israel then did exactly as God commanded.

(Exodus 14:5) 
News was brought to the king of Egypt that the people had fled. Then the hearts of Pharaoh and his servants changed regarding the people, and they said: “What have we done? Why did we let Israel leave our service?”

(Exodus 14:6) 
So Pharaoh prepared his royal chariot and took his entire army with him.

(Exodus 14:7) 
He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots in Egypt, and all the captains of the entire army.

(Exodus 14:8) 
And the Lord had hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel, who had departed with great confidence.

(Exodus 14:9) 
As the Egyptians followed the Israelites' tracks, they found them encamped by the Red Sea. All of Pharaoh's horsemen, chariots, and his entire army were at Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.

(Exodus 14:10) 
As Pharaoh approached, the children of Israel looked up and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. They became terrified and cried out to the Lord for help.

(Exodus 14:11) 
And they said to Moses: “Were there no graves for us in Egypt that you brought us out here to die in the wilderness? What have you done by leading us out of Egypt?”

(Exodus 14:12) 
“Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, saying: ‘Leave us alone so we may continue serving the Egyptians?’ It is far better for us to serve them than to die out here in the wilderness.”

(Exodus 14:13) 
And Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and witness the Lord's mighty works that He will perform for you today. For the Egyptians you see now, you will never see them again, ever.”

(Exodus 14:14) 
“The Lord Himself will fight on your behalf, and you only need to be silent.”

(Exodus 14:15) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the children of Israel to move forward!”

(Exodus 14:16) 
“As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the Red Sea, and divide its waters, so that the children of Israel may walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground.”

(Exodus 14:17) 
“And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, so that they will pursue you. I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.”

(Exodus 14:18) 
“Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have been glorified through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”

(Exodus 14:19) 
Then the Angel of God, who had been leading the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from its position in front of them and stood behind them.

(Exodus 14:20) 
It positioned itself between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. To the Egyptians, it was a dark cloud bringing darkness, but to the Israelites, it lit up the night. Thus, for the entire night, the two camps could not approach each other.

(Exodus 14:21) 
When Moses stretched out his hand over the Red Sea, the Lord drove the sea back with a powerful, strong wind that blew all night. He made the sea into dry land, and the waters were miraculously divided.

(Exodus 14:22) 
The children of Israel walked into the middle of the Red Sea on dry ground, with the waters forming a wall for them on both their right and left sides.

(Exodus 14:23) 
The Egyptians pursued them and went into the middle of the Red Sea after them—all of Pharaoh's cavalry, his chariots, and his horsemen.

(Exodus 14:24) 
In the early morning watch, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud upon the camp of the Egyptians and struck their army, causing great confusion.

(Exodus 14:25) 
He caused their chariot wheels to be removed, so that they drove with great difficulty. Then the Egyptians said: “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the Lord is fighting for them against us!”

(Exodus 14:26) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand over the Red Sea, so that the waters may return and cover the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen.”

(Exodus 14:27) 
So, when Moses stretched out his hand over the Red Sea, it returned to its full depth at the first break of dawn. As the Egyptians fled from it, they ran straight into the returning waters. The Lord then engulfed the Egyptians in the midst of the waves.

(Exodus 14:28) 
The waters returned and covered all the chariots and horsemen of Pharaoh's entire army that had pursued the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them survived.

(Exodus 14:29) 
But the children of Israel had walked safely through the middle of the dry Red Sea, with the waters forming a protective wall for them on their right and on their left.

(Exodus 14:30) 
On that day, the Lord delivered Israel from the power of the Egyptians. And the Israelites saw the dead bodies of the Egyptians lying on the seashore.

(Exodus 14:31) 
And Israel saw the Lord's great power that He had exercised against the Egyptians. The people then revered the Lord and put their trust in the Lord and in Moses, His servant.

(Exodus 15:1) 
Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying:

(Exodus 15:2) 
Let us sing to the Lord, for He has shown His great glory mightily; He has cast the horse and its rider into the sea.

(Exodus 15:3) 
My strength and my praise is the Lord; He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will glorify Him. He is the God of my father, and I will exalt Him.

(Exodus 15:4) 
The Lord is a mighty warrior; His name is the Almighty.

(Exodus 15:5) 
He cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea; his finest officers were submerged in the Red Sea.

(Exodus 15:6) 
Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power. Your right hand, O Lord, struck down the enemy.

(Exodus 15:7) 
And in the greatness of Your glory, You overthrew Your adversaries. You sent forth Your wrath, which devoured them like stubble.

(Exodus 15:8) 
And by the blast of Your fury, the waters were gathered together. The flowing waves stood up like a wall, and the mighty depths were congealed in the midst of the sea.

(Exodus 15:9) 
The enemy said, 'I will pursue, and I will overtake them. I will divide the spoil; my desire will be satisfied. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.'

(Exodus 15:10) 
You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

(Exodus 15:11) 
Who is like You among the mighty ones, O Lord? Who is like You, magnificent in holiness, awe-inspiring and worthy of praise, doing wonders?

(Exodus 15:12) 
You stretched out Your hand, and the earth swallowed them.

(Exodus 15:13) 
You led in Your mercy the people whom You redeemed; and You carried them in Your strength to Your holy dwelling place.

(Exodus 15:14) 
The nations heard, and they trembled. Pains seized the inhabitants of Philistia.

(Exodus 15:15) 
Then the princes of Edom were dismayed. Dread took hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan grew rigid with fear.

(Exodus 15:16) 
Let terror and dread fall upon them, by the greatness of Your arm. Let them become as still as a stone, until Your people pass over, O Lord—until this people passes over whom You have claimed as Your own.

(Exodus 15:17) 
You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance, Your most firm dwelling place, which You, O Lord, have made. It is Your sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.

(Exodus 15:18) 
The Lord will reign forever and beyond.

(Exodus 15:19) 
For Pharaoh’s horses, with his chariots and his horsemen, went into the sea; and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.

(Exodus 15:20) 
Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and in dances.

(Exodus 15:21) 
And Miriam led them in song, saying: 'Let us sing to the Lord, for He has shown His great glory mightily; He has cast the horse and its rider into the sea.'

(Exodus 15:22) 
Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the desert of Sur. They journeyed for three days through the wilderness and found no water.

(Exodus 15:23) 
And they came to Marah, but they could not drink the waters of Marah because they were bitter. Therefore, a fitting name was given to the place, and he called its name Marah, which means 'bitterness.'

(Exodus 15:24) 
And the people murmured against Moses, saying, 'What shall we drink?'

(Exodus 15:25) 
But Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When Moses cast it into the waters, they became sweet. There the Lord established for them decrees and judgments, and there He tested him—Moses, and through him, the people of Israel.

(Exodus 15:26) 
Saying: 'If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and will do what is right in His sight, and will obey His commandments, and keep all My statutes, I will bring upon you none of the diseases which I brought upon Egypt. For I am the Lord your healer.'

(Exodus 15:27) 
Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.

(Exodus 16:1) 
They set out from Elim. The entire people of the Children of Israel came to the desert of Sin, which is located between Elim and Sinai. This happened on the fifteenth day of the second month—about a month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 16:2) 
The entire community of the Children of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron while they were in the wilderness.

(Exodus 16:3) 
And they said to Moses and Aaron, 'If only we had died by the hand of the Lord while we were in the land of Egypt! There, we used to sit by pots of meat and eat our fill of bread. Why have you brought us out into this wilderness, only to kill this entire community with hunger?'

(Exodus 16:4) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Listen, I will rain bread down for you from the sky. The people must go out and gather what is sufficient for each day, so that I may test them to see whether they will follow My law or not.'

(Exodus 16:5) 
'But on the sixth day, they must prepare what they bring in, and it will be double what they are accustomed to gather on other days.'

(Exodus 16:6) 
Then Moses and Aaron said to all the Children of Israel, 'This evening you will know that the Lord brought you out from the land of Egypt.'

(Exodus 16:7) 
'And in the morning, you will see the glory of the Lord. For the Lord has heard your murmuring against Him. For who are we, that you should complain against us?'

(Exodus 16:8) 
And Moses added, 'The Lord will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to eat your fill in the morning. This is because the Lord has heard your murmuring, with which you have murmured against Him. For who are we? Your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord.'

(Exodus 16:9) 
Then Moses said to Aaron, 'Say to the entire assembly of the Children of Israel: Come forward before the Lord, for He has heard your murmuring.'

(Exodus 16:10) 
And as Aaron spoke to the entire multitude of the Children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness. And behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.

(Exodus 16:11) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Exodus 16:12) 
'I have heard the murmuring of the Children of Israel. Speak to them, saying: This evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. And you will know that I am the Lord your God.'

(Exodus 16:13) 
So, it came to pass that in the evening, quails came up and covered the entire camp. And in the morning, there was dew lying all around the camp.

(Exodus 16:14) 
When the dew had evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness, there appeared something like fine flakes of frost upon the ground.

(Exodus 16:15) 
When the Children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, 'Man hu?' which means: 'What is this?' For they did not know what it was.

(Exodus 16:16) 
Then Moses said to them, 'This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.'

(Exodus 16:17) 
'This is what the Lord has commanded: Let each one of you gather from it as much as he needs to eat—a gomor for each person, according to the number of souls in your tents. So shall you gather it.'

(Exodus 16:18) 
And the Children of Israel did so; some gathered more, some less.

(Exodus 16:19) 
And they measured it by the gomor: he who had gathered more had no excess, and he who had gathered less found no shortage. Each person had gathered just enough according to what they could eat.

(Exodus 16:20) 
And Moses said to them, 'Let no one leave any of it until morning.'

(Exodus 16:21) 
But they did not listen. Some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses became angry with them.

(Exodus 16:22) 
They gathered it every morning, each person as much as they needed. But when the sun grew hot, it would melt away.

(Exodus 16:23) 
But on the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food, two gomors for each person. And all the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.

(Exodus 16:24) 
He answered, 'This is what the Lord has said: Tomorrow is the rest of the Sabbath, a holy day for the Lord. Whatever you need to bake, bake today; and whatever you need to boil, boil today. But whatever is left over, set aside until morning.'

(Exodus 16:25) 
So they set it aside until morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not become foul, nor were any worms found in it.

(Exodus 16:26) 
Then Moses said, 'Eat it today, because today is the Sabbath of the Lord. Today you will not find any of it in the field.'

(Exodus 16:27) 
And it happened that on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, but they found nothing.

(Exodus 16:28) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, 'How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My law?'

(Exodus 16:29) 
'See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath. That is why on the sixth day He gave you food for two days. Let each of you remain in your place; let no one go out from his place on the seventh day.'

(Exodus 16:30) 
So the people rested on the seventh day.

(Exodus 16:31) 
The house of Israel called its name Manna. It was like white coriander seed, and its taste was like flour mixed with honey.

(Exodus 16:32) 
And Moses said, 'This is what the Lord has commanded: Fill a gomor of it and keep it for your future generations, so that your descendants may know how I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.'

(Exodus 16:33) 
Then Moses said to Aaron, 'Take an urn and put in it as much Manna as a gomor can hold, and place it beside the Testimony, so that it may be kept for your future generations.'

(Exodus 16:34) 
As the Lord had commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it beside the Testimony for safekeeping.

(Exodus 16:35) 
Now the Children of Israel ate Manna for forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They used this food until they reached the borders of the land of Canaan.

(Exodus 16:36) 
Now, a gomor is the tenth part of an ephah.

(Exodus 17:1) 
The entire community of the sons of Israel then moved on. They departed from the Desert of Sin, traveling through their regular stopping places. This was all according to the command of the Lord. They made their camp in a place called Rephidim, but there was no water there for the community to drink.

(Exodus 17:2) 
The community argued with Moses. They demanded: “Give us water so we can drink!” Moses replied to them: “Why are you quarreling with me? Why are you putting the Lord God to the test?”

(Exodus 17:3) 
The community there became extremely thirsty due to the lack of water. And they grumbled against Moses, saying: “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it so you could kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”

(Exodus 17:4) 
Moses then cried out to the Lord God, saying: “What should I do for this community? It will be only a little while, and they will stone me to death.”

(Exodus 17:5) 
Then the Lord God said to Moses: “Go ahead of the community, and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Also, take in your hand your staff—the very one with which you struck the Nile River—and go.”

(Exodus 17:6) 
“Look, I will stand before you there, on the rock at Horeb. You will strike that rock, and water will flow out of it so the community can drink.” Moses did exactly as he was told, in the presence of the elders of Israel.

(Exodus 17:7) 
And he called the name of that place Massa, which means “Testing”. He did this because the sons of Israel quarreled, and because they put the Lord God to the test, saying: “Is the Lord God truly among us, or not?”

(Exodus 17:8) 
Amalek then came and fought against Israel in Rephidim.

(Exodus 17:9) 
Moses said to Joshua: “Choose strong, capable men for yourself. Go out with them and fight against Amalek. Tomorrow, I will stand at the top of the hill, holding the staff of God in my hand.”

(Exodus 17:10) 
Joshua did exactly as Moses had told him, and he fought against Amalek. Meanwhile, Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the very top of the hill.

(Exodus 17:11) 
Whenever Moses raised his hands, Israel gained the advantage. But when he lowered them even slightly, Amalek began to prevail.

(Exodus 17:12) 
However, Moses' arms were very heavy. So they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands on both sides. And so it was that his hands remained raised until the setting of the sun.

(Exodus 17:13) 
Joshua then routed Amalek and his community with the edge of the sword.

(Exodus 17:14) 
Then the Lord God said to Moses: “Write this down as a memorial in a book, and recite it for Joshua to hear, because I will utterly blot out the name of Amalek from under the sky.”

(Exodus 17:15) 
And Moses built an altar. He called its name “The Lord is My Exaltation”, or “The Lord is My Banner”.

(Exodus 17:16) 
For he said: “Because a hand was lifted against the Lord God's throne, the Lord God's war will be against Amalek from generation to generation.”

(Exodus 18:1) 
Jethro, Moses' father-in-law and the priest of Midian, heard about all the great and mighty things God had done for Moses and for His people Israel, because the Lord had led Israel out of Egypt.

(Exodus 18:2) 
Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after Moses had sent her away for a time.

(Exodus 18:3) 
And Jethro also took Moses' two sons. The name of the first son was Gershom, which means 'I have been a stranger in a foreign land'.

(Exodus 18:4) 
The name of the other son was Eliezer, which means 'For the God of my father is my helper, and He has rescued me from the hand of Pharaoh'.

(Exodus 18:5) 
So Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with Moses' sons and his wife to Moses in the desert, where Moses had set up camp near the mountain of God.

(Exodus 18:6) 
Jethro sent a messenger to Moses, saying, 'I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife and your two sons with her.'

(Exodus 18:7) 
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. He bowed down to him and kissed him. They asked about each other's well-being, and then they entered Moses' tent.

(Exodus 18:8) 
Moses then recounted to his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and all the hardship and troubles that had befallen them on their journey, and how the Lord had graciously delivered them from every danger.

(Exodus 18:9) 
Jethro rejoiced greatly over all the good things the Lord had done for Israel, especially because He had delivered them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians.

(Exodus 18:10) 
And Jethro said, 'Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you from the cruel hand of the Egyptians and from the powerful hand of Pharaoh, and who has rescued His people from the servitude of Egypt.'

(Exodus 18:11) 
Now I know and fully understand that the Lord is greater than all other gods, because He has demonstrated His power against those who dealt so proudly and arrogantly with Israel.

(Exodus 18:12) 
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came and ate a sacred meal with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.

(Exodus 18:13) 
Now on the next day, Moses sat as judge over the people. And the people stood before Moses from early morning until late in the evening.

(Exodus 18:14) 
When Moses' father-in-law saw all the work Moses was doing for the people, he asked, 'What is this thing you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?'

(Exodus 18:15) 
Moses answered him, 'It is because the people come to me to inquire about God's will and to seek a judgment from Him.'

(Exodus 18:16) 
Whenever they have a dispute, they come to me, so that I may judge between them and make known to them the statutes of God and His laws.

(Exodus 18:17) 
Moses' father-in-law said to him, 'The way you are handling this situation is not good; it is not efficient or sustainable.'

(Exodus 18:18) 
'You will surely wear yourself out, and so will these people who are with you. The burden of this task is too heavy for you; you alone cannot possibly bear it.'

(Exodus 18:19) 
'Now listen to my words, and I will give you counsel, and may God be with you as you implement it. You should continue to represent the people before God, bringing their cases and concerns to Him.'

(Exodus 18:20) 
'You should also instruct them in God's statutes and sacred ceremonies, and show them the specific path they should walk and the work they are obligated to do.'

(Exodus 18:21) 
'But from among all the people, you must select capable men—men who truly fear God, who are trustworthy, and who utterly hate dishonest gain and corruption. Appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.'

(Exodus 18:22) 
'Let these men judge the people at all times. Whatever matters are too major or complex, they should refer to you, but they themselves should judge all the minor and simpler matters. This way, your burden will be lighter, as the responsibility will be shared by others.'

(Exodus 18:23) 
'If you do this, and God so commands you to do it, then you will be able to endure this work, and all these people will be able to return to their homes in peace and with justice served.'

(Exodus 18:24) 
Moses listened carefully to his father-in-law's voice and did everything that he had suggested.

(Exodus 18:25) 
So Moses chose capable and virtuous men from all of Israel and appointed them as leaders over the people: leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.

(Exodus 18:26) 
These appointed men judged the people at all times. Whatever matters were more significant, they referred to Moses himself; only the minor cases did they judge on their own.

(Exodus 18:27) 
Then Moses sent his father-in-law away, and Jethro returned and went back to his own land.

(Exodus 19:1) 
In the third month after Israel had departed from the land of Egypt, on that very day, they arrived in the Sinai wilderness.

(Exodus 19:2) 
After they had set out from Rephidim and arrived at the Sinai desert, they made their camp in that very place. There, the people of Israel pitched their tents facing Mount Sinai.

(Exodus 19:3) 
Moses then climbed the mountain to encounter God. From the mountain, the Lord called to him, saying, "You are to speak these words to the family of Jacob, and you are to announce them to the descendants of Israel:"

(Exodus 19:4) 
"You yourselves saw what I did to the Egyptians. You saw how I carried you safely, as if on the wings of eagles, and brought you directly to Myself."

(Exodus 19:5) 
"Now then, if you truly listen to My voice and faithfully keep My covenant, you will become My own cherished possession from among all the nations. For the entire earth is Mine."

(Exodus 19:6) 
"And you will be for Me a kingdom of priests—a nation set apart by God to serve Him—and a holy people. These are the words you must speak to the people of Israel."

(Exodus 19:7) 
So Moses returned and called together the elders of the people. He then explained to them all the words and instructions that the Lord had commanded him to share.

(Exodus 19:8) 
And all the people responded together, saying, "Everything that the Lord has spoken, we will do." Then Moses reported the people's words back to the Lord.

(Exodus 19:9) 
The Lord said to Moses, "Listen! I am coming to you in a thick, dark cloud. This is so the people will hear Me speaking with you directly, and from that moment on, they will always believe in you." Moses had already delivered the people's words to the Lord.

(Exodus 19:10) 
Then the Lord told him, "Go to the people and prepare them to be set apart for Me today and tomorrow. They must wash their garments."

(Exodus 19:11) 
"And they must be ready by the third day, because on that third day, the Lord Himself will descend visibly upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."

(Exodus 19:12) 
"You must also set boundaries around the mountain for the people, and tell them: 'Be extremely careful not to go up on the mountain or even touch its edge. Anyone who touches the mountain will certainly be put to death.'"

(Exodus 19:13) 
"No human hand should touch such a one, but they must be stoned or shot through with arrows. Whether it is an animal or a person, it shall not live if it touches the mountain. Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast, then they may ascend the mountain."

(Exodus 19:14) 
So Moses descended from the mountain to the people and oversaw their purification rites. When they had washed their garments,

(Exodus 19:15) 
he told them, "Be ready by the third day, and during this time, do not engage in marital relations."

(Exodus 19:16) 
On the third day, as morning dawned, suddenly there were thunderings and flashes of lightning, and a very thick cloud covered Mount Sinai. A powerful blast from a ram's horn sounded, growing louder and louder. The people who were in the camp were filled with terror.

(Exodus 19:17) 
Moses then led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the very foot of the mountain.

(Exodus 19:18) 
The entire Mount Sinai was smoking because the Lord had descended upon it in fire. Smoke billowed up from it like from a furnace, and the whole mountain was violently shaken.

(Exodus 19:19) 
The sound of the ram's horn continued to grow louder and more prolonged. Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice that could be heard.

(Exodus 19:20) 
The Lord descended upon the summit of Mount Sinai. From there, He called Moses to the very top of the mountain. When Moses had climbed up,

(Exodus 19:21) 
God said to him, "Go down at once and strictly warn the people not to break through the boundaries to gaze upon the Lord, for if they do, many of them will surely perish."

(Exodus 19:22) 
"Even the priests who regularly approach the Lord must consecrate themselves, otherwise, the Lord might strike them down."

(Exodus 19:23) 
Moses said to the Lord, "The people cannot possibly ascend Mount Sinai, because You Yourself warned us and strictly commanded: 'Set boundaries around the mountain and make it holy.'"

(Exodus 19:24) 
The Lord said to him, "Go down! Then you may come up again, you and Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through the boundaries and ascend to the Lord, lest He strike them dead."

(Exodus 19:25) 
So Moses went down to the people and told them all these things.

(Exodus 20:1) 
And the Lord spoke all these commands, saying:

(Exodus 20:2) 
“I am the Lord, your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of your slavery.

(Exodus 20:3) 
You shall not have other gods besides Me.

(Exodus 20:4) 
You shall not make for yourself any carved image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the sky above, or that is on the earth below, or that is in the waters beneath the earth.

(Exodus 20:5) 
You shall not adore these false images, nor worship them; for I am the Lord, your God, a powerful and jealous God, who punishes the wickedness of the fathers on their children, even to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me.

(Exodus 20:6) 
But I show mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

(Exodus 20:7) 
You shall not take the Name of the Lord, your God, in vain; for the Lord will not hold guiltless anyone who takes the Name of the Lord, his God, in vain.

(Exodus 20:8) 
Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.

(Exodus 20:9) 
For six days you shall labor and do all your work.

(Exodus 20:10) 
But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, your God; you shall not do any work on it, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your animal, nor the stranger who is within your gates.

(Exodus 20:11) 
For in six days the Lord made the universe, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

(Exodus 20:12) 
Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land that the Lord, your God, will give you.

(Exodus 20:13) 
You shall not murder.

(Exodus 20:14) 
You shall not commit adultery.

(Exodus 20:15) 
You shall not steal.

(Exodus 20:16) 
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

(Exodus 20:17) 
You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not desire his wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to him.”

(Exodus 20:18) 
Now all the people saw the thundering voices, and the lightning flashes, and the sound of the trumpet, and the smoking mountain. And being terrified and shaken with fear, they stood afar off.

(Exodus 20:19) 
They said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die.”

(Exodus 20:20) 
And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, and that His awe-inspiring presence might be in you, so that you do not sin.”

(Exodus 20:21) 
So the people stood afar off, but Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.

(Exodus 20:22) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I spoke to you from the sky.’

(Exodus 20:23) 
You shall not make gods of silver alongside Me, nor shall you make gods of gold for yourselves.

(Exodus 20:24) 
You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and on it you shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My Name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.

(Exodus 20:25) 
But if you make an altar of stones for Me, you shall not build it of cut and polished stones; for if you lift up a tool upon it, you will have defiled it.

(Exodus 20:26) 
Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be exposed upon it.”

(Exodus 20:27) 


(Exodus 20:28) 


(Exodus 20:29)

(Exodus 20:38) 


(Exodus 20:39) 


(Exodus 20:40) 


(Exodus 21:1) 
These are the legal decrees that you must present to the people of Israel.

(Exodus 21:2) 
If you purchase a Hebrew servant, he shall serve you for six years. In the seventh year, he shall leave as a free man without having to pay anything.

(Exodus 21:3) 
He shall leave with the same status he had when he entered service. If he entered with a wife, then his wife shall leave with him.

(Exodus 21:4) 
But if his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, then the wife and her children shall remain the master's property, and the man himself shall leave alone.

(Exodus 21:5) 
But if the servant should plainly declare, saying: 'I do not wish to leave as a free man, because I love my master, my wife, and my children; I want to remain with them.'

(Exodus 21:6) 
Then his master shall bring him before the judges, and he shall bring him to a door or doorpost. The master shall then pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall remain his servant for the rest of his life.

(Exodus 21:7) 
If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not leave her service as other female servants do.

(Exodus 21:8) 
If she does not please her master, to whom she was given, he must allow her to be redeemed by her family. He does not have the power to sell her to a foreign people if he has rejected her.

(Exodus 21:9) 
However, if he betroths her to his own son, then he must treat her with the same rights and dignity as a natural daughter.

(Exodus 21:10) 
And if he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, nor her conjugal rights.

(Exodus 21:11) 
If he does not provide her with these three things, then she shall leave as a free woman, without having to pay any money.

(Exodus 21:12) 
Whoever strikes a man and causes his death, he shall surely be put to death.

(Exodus 21:13) 
But if a man did not intentionally plot to kill, and God allowed the person to die by his hand accidentally, then I will designate a place for you where he may flee for safety.

(Exodus 21:14) 
But if someone intentionally and treacherously murders his neighbor, you shall take him away from My altar, and he shall be put to death.

(Exodus 21:15) 
Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

(Exodus 21:16) 
Whoever kidnaps a person and sells him, and is proven guilty, shall surely be put to death.

(Exodus 21:17) 
Whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

(Exodus 21:18) 
If men quarrel and one strikes his neighbor with a stone or with his fist, and the man does not die but is confined to his bed,

(Exodus 21:19) 
if the injured man then rises and walks about outside, even if with a staff, the man who struck him shall not be guilty of murder. However, the assailant must pay for the injured man’s lost wages and cover all medical expenses for his full recovery.

(Exodus 21:20) 
If a man strikes his male or female servant with a rod, and the servant dies while still under his hand, the master shall be guilty of a crime.

(Exodus 21:21) 
However, if the servant survives for a day or two, the master shall not be punished for murder, as the servant is considered his property, and the loss of his property is a sufficient consequence for him.

(Exodus 21:22) 
If men quarrel and one strikes a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry, but the woman herself lives, then the offender shall surely be fined. The amount of the fine shall be determined by what the woman's husband demands, and what the judges determine is just.

(Exodus 21:23) 
But if her death also results from the injury, then it shall be 'a life for a life'—the offender shall be put to death.

(Exodus 21:24) 
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,

(Exodus 21:25) 
a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, a bruise for a bruise.

(Exodus 21:26) 
If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant and permanently damages it, he must set the servant free in compensation for the eye he destroyed.

(Exodus 21:27) 
And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female servant, he shall likewise set them free.

(Exodus 21:28) 
If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. However, the owner of the ox shall be considered innocent of the death, provided he was unaware of the ox's aggressive nature.

(Exodus 21:29) 
But if the ox was known to be aggressive and prone to goring in the past, and its owner was warned about it yet failed to keep it securely confined, and it then kills a man or a woman, then both the ox shall be stoned to death and its owner shall also be put to death.

(Exodus 21:30) 
However, if a ransom is imposed upon him instead of the death penalty, he shall pay whatever amount is demanded as compensation for his life.

(Exodus 21:31) 
Whether the ox kills a son or a daughter, the owner shall be judged according to these same laws.

(Exodus 21:32) 
If the ox kills a male or female servant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the servant's master, and the ox itself shall be stoned to death.

(Exodus 21:33) 
If a man opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,

(Exodus 21:34) 
the owner of the pit shall fully compensate the animal's owner with money. The dead animal itself shall then belong to the owner of the pit.

(Exodus 21:35) 
If one man's ox gores another man's ox so that it dies, then they shall sell the living ox and divide the money from the sale equally. They shall also divide the carcass of the dead ox.

(Exodus 21:36) 
But if it was known that the ox was accustomed to goring in the past, and its owner did not keep it confined, then he must give an ox in full payment for the other ox. The dead ox shall then belong to the negligent owner.

(Exodus 22:1) 
If someone steals an ox or a sheep, and then either slaughters it or sells it, he shall repay five oxen for the one ox, and four sheep for the one sheep. This law ensures a high restitution for depriving the owner of their property permanently.

(Exodus 22:2) 
If a thief is caught breaking into a house—by tunneling through a wall or breaking in—and is struck and dies, the one who killed him will not be held guilty for his death. This law permits self-defense against burglars at night.

(Exodus 22:3) 
But if this happens after sunrise, the homeowner will be guilty for the death. If the thief survives, he must make restitution. If he has nothing, he shall be sold into servitude to cover the cost of his theft. This distinction between night and day reflects the assumption that at night, one cannot discern the thief's intent.

(Exodus 22:4) 
If the stolen animal—whether an ox, a donkey, or a sheep—is found alive in the thief's possession, he must restore double its value to the owner. This lesser penalty applies when the stolen item can be returned.

(Exodus 22:5) 
If someone lets his livestock graze in a field or vineyard belonging to another, causing damage, he must make restitution with the best produce from his own field and vineyard. This ensures that the compensation is full and fair.

(Exodus 22:6) 
If a fire starts and spreads to thorny bushes, then catches a field of grain—whether it is standing or gathered in piles—or an entire field, the person who started the fire must repay the damage. This law holds one responsible for negligence with fire.

(Exodus 22:7) 
If someone gives money or an item to a friend for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the one who received it: if the thief is caught, he must restore double its value. This protects entrusted property.

(Exodus 22:8) 
If the thief is not found, the owner of the house where the item was stolen from safekeeping must approach the judges—who represent God's justice—and swear an oath that he did not take the item himself. This places the matter under divine judgment.

(Exodus 22:9) 
For every case of fraud—whether it concerns an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any other loss—if a person is suspected but cannot prove he did not steal, he shall repay double to his neighbor. This covers various types of misappropriation.

(Exodus 22:10) 
If someone entrusts to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal for safekeeping, and it dies, is injured, or is carried off, and no one witnesses what happened:

(Exodus 22:11) 
An oath before God shall settle the matter between them both, that the keeper did not lay a hand on his neighbor's property. The owner must accept this sworn statement, and the keeper will not be compelled to pay restitution. This relies on the keeper's integrity before God.

(Exodus 22:12) 
But if the animal was stolen from the keeper, he must pay restitution for the loss to the owner. This indicates a higher level of responsibility for preventing theft.

(Exodus 22:13) 
If the animal was torn apart by a wild beast, the keeper must bring the remains as proof, and he will not have to pay restitution for the loss. This acknowledges uncontrollable circumstances.

(Exodus 22:14) 
If someone borrows an animal from a friend, and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, the borrower must certainly repay its value. This is because the borrower is solely responsible for its care.

(Exodus 22:15) 
But if the owner was present when the injury or death occurred, the borrower is not compelled to repay. This applies especially if the animal was hired out; the rental fee itself covers the risk of loss in the presence of the owner.

(Exodus 22:16) 
If someone seduces a virgin who is not yet promised to another man, and has relations with her, he must pay the marriage price for her and take her as his wife. This law protects the virgin's honor and ensures her future.

(Exodus 22:17) 
If the virgin's father utterly refuses to give her to him, the seducer must still pay money equal to the customary marriage price for virgins. This serves as a penalty for his actions, even without marriage.

(Exodus 22:18) 
You shall not allow sorcerers and witches to live. This command reflects God's strong condemnation of magic and demonic practices.

(Exodus 22:19) 
Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must surely be put to death. This is an abomination against natural law and purity.

(Exodus 22:20) 
Whoever sacrifices to any god except the Lord God alone shall be utterly destroyed—put to death. This is a primary commandment against idolatry.

(Exodus 22:21) 
You shall not distress a foreigner, nor oppress him, because you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. This command calls for empathy and justice, remembering their own past experience.

(Exodus 22:22) 
You shall not harm widows or orphans. These vulnerable groups are under God's special protection.

(Exodus 22:23) 
If you harm them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry. This warns of God's immediate response to injustice against the vulnerable.

(Exodus 22:24) 
And my wrath will be kindled, and I will strike you down with the sword, so your own wives will become widows and your children orphans. This is a severe warning of reciprocal divine judgment.

(Exodus 22:25) 
If you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, you shall not act like a moneylender towards them. You shall not burden them with interest. This command prohibits usury among Israelites, especially to the poor.

(Exodus 22:26) 
If you take your neighbor's outer garment as a pledge for a loan, you must return it to him before the sun sets. This is because the poor may need it for warmth during the night.

(Exodus 22:27) 
For it is his only covering, the very clothing for his body; he has nothing else to sleep in. If he cries out to me, I will hear him, because I am merciful. God hears the cries of the poor and oppressed.

(Exodus 22:28) 
You shall not revile the judges—those who represent God's authority—nor curse the ruler of your people. This command teaches respect for all authority, both divine and civil.

(Exodus 22:29) 
You shall not delay in offering your tithes and your first fruits. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me. This refers to the dedication of the firstborn male to God, later redeemed.

(Exodus 22:30) 
You shall do the same with your oxen and your sheep: for seven days, an offspring shall be with its mother, but on the eighth day, you shall give it to Me. This is about dedicating the firstborn animals.

(Exodus 22:31) 
You shall be holy people to Me. You must not eat any meat that has been torn by wild beasts in the field, but you shall throw it to the dogs. This preserves ritual purity and distinction.

(Exodus 23:1) 
You shall not accept a false report. Nor shall you join hands with a wicked person to give dishonest testimony.

(Exodus 23:2) 
You shall not follow the crowd to do evil. Nor shall you in a lawsuit agree with the opinion of the many, if their judgment would cause you to deviate from the truth.

(Exodus 23:3) 
You shall not show partiality to a poor person in a lawsuit.

(Exodus 23:4) 
If you encounter the ox or donkey of your enemy straying, you must bring it back to him.

(Exodus 23:5) 
If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying under its burden, you shall not just pass by it, but you must help the person to lift it up.

(Exodus 23:6) 
You shall not pervert justice against a poor person in their lawsuit.

(Exodus 23:7) 
You shall flee from falsehood. You shall not kill an innocent and righteous person, for I abhor the wicked.

(Exodus 23:8) 
Nor shall you accept bribes, which blind even the wise and distort the words of the righteous.

(Exodus 23:9) 
You shall not oppress a foreigner, for you know the hearts of foreigners, because you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.

(Exodus 23:10) 
For six years you shall sow your land and gather its harvest.

(Exodus 23:11) 
But in the seventh year, you shall let the land rest and lie fallow. This is so the poor among your people may eat from it, and whatever they leave, the wild animals of your region may devour. You shall do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.

(Exodus 23:12) 
For six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. This is so your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant, along with the foreigner, may be refreshed.

(Exodus 23:13) 
All that I have told you, you shall observe carefully. You shall not swear by the names of other gods, nor shall their names be heard from your mouth.

(Exodus 23:14) 
Three times a year you shall keep a feast for Me.

(Exodus 23:15) 
You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat no leavened bread, just as I commanded you at the appointed time in the month of Abib (which means 'new sprouts'), when you came out of Egypt. You shall not appear before Me empty-handed.

(Exodus 23:16) 
And you shall observe the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labor, of what you have sown in the field. And you shall observe the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered all your produce from the field.

(Exodus 23:17) 
Three times a year, all your males shall appear before the Lord, your God.

(Exodus 23:18) 
You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall any part of the sacrifice of My feast remain until the morning.

(Exodus 23:19) 
You shall bring the best of the firstfruits of your land into the house of the Lord, your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

(Exodus 23:20) 
Behold, I am sending My angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.

(Exodus 23:21) 
Be attentive to him and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him. For he will not forgive your transgressions, because My Name is in him.

(Exodus 23:22) 
But if you diligently listen to his voice and do all that I speak to you through him, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and afflict those who afflict you.

(Exodus 23:23) 
My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, whom I will utterly destroy.

(Exodus 23:24) 
You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them. You shall not imitate their practices, but you shall utterly break down their sacred pillars and smash their altars.

(Exodus 23:25) 
And you shall serve the Lord, your God, so that I may bless your bread and your water, and remove sickness from your midst.

(Exodus 23:26) 
There shall be no woman who miscarries or is barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.

(Exodus 23:27) 
I will send My terror before you and throw into confusion every people to whom you come. I will make all your enemies flee from you.

(Exodus 23:28) 
I will send My forces before you, which will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites, before you enter the land.

(Exodus 23:29) 
I will not drive them out from before you in a single year, lest the land become desolate and the wild animals multiply against you.

(Exodus 23:30) 
Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you become numerous and take possession of the land.

(Exodus 23:31) 
And I will set your boundaries from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River (meaning the Euphrates). For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hands, and I will drive them out from before you.

(Exodus 23:32) 
You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

(Exodus 23:33) 
They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me by serving their gods, which would become a snare to you.

(Exodus 24:1) 
God also said to Moses: "Come up to the Lord, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy elders from Israel, and you all shall worship from a distance (as a sign of reverence for My holy presence)."

(Exodus 24:2) 
Moses alone will ascend closer to the Lord. The others (Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders) will not come near Him, and the people will not ascend with Moses at all (maintaining a clear distinction in access to God's presence).

(Exodus 24:3) 
So Moses came down and told the people all the words (commands and laws) of the Lord, as well as His judgments. And all the people responded with one voice, proclaiming: "All the words which the Lord has spoken, we will do (confirming their acceptance of the covenant)."

(Exodus 24:4) 
Then Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord (the terms of the covenant). And rising early in the morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and he set up twelve stone pillars, each one representing one of the twelve tribes of Israel (symbolizing their unified presence before God).

(Exodus 24:5) 
He then sent young men from among the children of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings (sacrifices entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God). They also sacrificed calves as peace offerings (sacrifices for fellowship and communion with God and each other) to the Lord.

(Exodus 24:6) 
So Moses took half of the blood from these sacrifices and put it into basins. But the other half he poured over the altar (signifying atonement and consecration to God).

(Exodus 24:7) 
Then, taking the book of the covenant (the written laws and stipulations), he read it aloud for the people to hear. And they responded, saying: "Everything that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient (reaffirming their solemn commitment)."

(Exodus 24:8) 
Then Moses took the remaining blood and sprinkled it on the people. And he declared: "This is the blood of the covenant (the solemn agreement sealed by life itself) which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words (His laws and promises)."

(Exodus 24:9) 
So Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel (the same group mentioned in verse 1, now granted a closer approach) went up the mountain.

(Exodus 24:10) 
And they saw a manifestation of the God of Israel. Under His feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire stone, appearing as clear and blue as the sky when it is serene (a vision of divine glory, not God's essence).

(Exodus 24:11) 
And God did not lay His hand in judgment upon these leaders who had seen this manifestation of Him, even though it was a partial viewing of the Almighty. So they saw God (in His revealed glory), and they ate and drank (participating in a covenant meal in His presence, an act of great favor).

(Exodus 24:12) 
Then the Lord said to Moses: "Come up to Me on the mountain and stay there (for an extended period). And I will give you tablets of stone (the Decalogue, written by My own hand), containing the Law and the commandments which I have written, so that you may teach them to the people of Israel."

(Exodus 24:13) 
So Moses rose, along with Joshua his assistant (who would accompany him part-way up the mountain). And Moses began ascending the mountain of God (Mount Sinai, where God's presence was revealed).

(Exodus 24:14) 
He said to the elders (who remained at the foot of the mountain): "Wait here for us until we return to you. You will have Aaron and Hur with you; if any question or dispute arises among you, you shall refer it to them (as your temporary leaders)."

(Exodus 24:15) 
As Moses ascended higher, a thick cloud covered the mountain (a visible sign of God's dwelling there and His hidden glory).

(Exodus 24:16) 
And the glory of the Lord (His magnificent presence) dwelt (rested) upon Mount Sinai, with the cloud covering it for six days. On the seventh day, He called Moses from the midst of the thick darkness (the innermost part of the cloud where God communed directly with him).

(Exodus 24:17) 
Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord, as visible to the children of Israel below, was like a blazing fire on the very top of the mountain (a fearsome and awe-inspiring sight).

(Exodus 24:18) 
So Moses entered the midst of the cloud and ascended further into the mountain. And he remained there for forty days and forty nights (a profound period of fasting, communion, and divine instruction).

(Exodus 24:19) 
The Lord spoke to Moses again (while he was on the mountain), saying:

(Exodus 24:20) 
"Tell the children of Israel to bring Me offerings. From every person whose heart moves him to offer willingly (without compulsion), you shall accept these offerings for My sanctuary."

(Exodus 24:21) 
"Now these are the materials you are to receive (as voluntary offerings): gold, and silver, and bronze (or copper, as a strong and useful metal)."

(Exodus 24:22) 
"And blue fabric, and purple fabric, and scarlet fabric (dyed twice for a rich, vibrant color). Also, fine linen, and goats' hair (for durable textiles)."

(Exodus 24:23) 
"And rams' skins dyed red, and fine leather (likely badger skins or another durable, colorful leather suitable for covering). And acacia wood (a strong, rot-resistant wood found in the desert regions)."

(Exodus 24:24) 
"Oil for the lamps (to keep the sanctuary illuminated). Spices for the anointing oil (used to consecrate persons and objects) and fragrant incense (for worship, creating a sweet aroma before God)."

(Exodus 24:25) 
"Onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod (a sacred vestment worn on the shoulders by the High Priest) and the breastplate (a ceremonial pouch worn over the chest, containing the Urim and Thummim for divine guidance)."

(Exodus 24:26) 
"And they shall make Me a sanctuary (a holy, set-apart dwelling place). The purpose of this is so that I may dwell (make My presence known) among them (as their God and guide)."

(Exodus 24:27) 
"You are to make it according to every exact pattern of the tabernacle (this portable dwelling of God) which I will show you, and according to the pattern of all its vessels (the sacred furnishings) for its service. This is precisely how you shall make it (emphasizing divine origin and specific design)."

(Exodus 24:28) 
"They shall also make an ark (a sacred chest, the most important object in the Tabernacle) of acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits (approximately 45 inches). Its width shall be one and a half cubits (approximately 27 inches). And its height shall also be one and a half cubits (approximately 27 inches)."

(Exodus 24:29) 
"You shall overlay it (the ark) with pure gold, both inside and out. And you shall make a gold molding (a decorative rim, often called a 'crown') around its upper edge (adding to its beauty and distinction)."

(Exodus 24:30) 
"And you shall cast four gold rings, which you will place on its four feet (or corners), one on each side of the ark. Two rings shall be on one side, and two rings on the other side (providing attachment points for carrying)."

(Exodus 24:31) 
"You shall also make poles (carrying staves) of acacia wood, and you shall overlay them with gold (matching the ark's precious material)."

(Exodus 24:32) 
"You shall put these poles through the rings that are on the sides of the ark, so that it may be carried by them (without anyone directly touching the holy ark)."

(Exodus 24:33) 
"These poles shall remain in the rings permanently. They shall never be removed from them (as a strict command, emphasizing the ark's sanctity and readiness for movement)."

(Exodus 24:34) 
"And you shall put into the ark the Testimony (the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, which bear witness to God's covenant) which I will give to you (as the foundation of My covenant with Israel)."

(Exodus 24:35) 
"You shall also make a mercy seat (or 'atonement cover') of pure gold. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits (exactly matching the dimensions of the ark it will cover)."

(Exodus 24:36) 
"You shall also make two cherubim (angelic figures, symbolizing heavenly guardians of God's presence) of hammered gold. You shall make them skillfully crafted from the two ends of the mercy seat (where God will speak, hence 'oracle')."

(Exodus 24:37) 
"One cherub shall be on one side (of the mercy seat), and the other cherub on the other side. You shall make them to emerge seamlessly from each end of the mercy seat itself." This ensures they are an integral part of the mercy seat.

(Exodus 24:38) 
"The cherubim shall have their wings spread upwards, covering the mercy seat with their wings (as if guarding it). And their faces shall be turned towards each other, looking reverently down towards the mercy seat (the place of divine communion and atonement)."

(Exodus 24:39) 
"And you shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark. In that ark, you shall place the Testimony (the tablets of the Law) which I will give to you (thus the mercy seat covers the Law, signifying God's mercy over judgment)."

(Exodus 24:40) 
"From there (from above the mercy seat), I will give commands to you. And I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of the Testimony (the Ark of the Covenant). There, I will give you all the commandments that I will impart through you to the children of Israel (establishing this as the central place of divine revelation and intercession)."

(Exodus 25:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

(Exodus 25:2) 
Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to bring me contributions—offerings for the Tabernacle. You are to receive these gifts from everyone whose heart is willing to give.

(Exodus 25:3) 
These are the contributions you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze;

(Exodus 25:4) 
blue-violet yarn, purple yarn, scarlet yarn that has been dyed twice, fine linen, and goat hair;

(Exodus 25:5) 
rams’ skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;

(Exodus 25:6) 
oil for the lamps, aromatic spices for anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod and the breastpiece.

(Exodus 25:7) 
oil for the lamps, aromatic spices for anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod and the breastpiece.

(Exodus 25:8) 
And they shall build a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them and be present with My people.

(Exodus 25:9) 
You shall make it exactly according to all the design of the Tabernacle that I will show you, and of all its furnishings for its service. You shall make it in this way.

(Exodus 25:10) 
You shall make an Ark from acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, its width one and a half cubits, and its height likewise one and a half cubits.

(Exodus 25:11) 
You shall cover it with the purest gold, inside and outside you shall cover it. You shall also make a golden crown, a molding around its upper edge, all around it.

(Exodus 25:12) 
And you shall cast four gold rings for it, and place them on its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side.

(Exodus 25:13) 
You shall also make poles from acacia wood, and cover them with gold.

(Exodus 25:14) 
You shall put the poles into the rings that are on the sides of the Ark, so that it may be carried by them.

(Exodus 25:15) 
The poles shall remain in the rings permanently; they are not to be removed from them.

(Exodus 25:16) 
And into the Ark you shall put the testimony—the tablets of the Ten Commandments—which I will give to you.

(Exodus 25:17) 
You shall also make a propitiatory—a mercy seat—of the purest gold. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits.

(Exodus 25:18) 
You shall make two cherubim—angelic figures—of gold. You shall make them of hammered work at the two ends of the propitiatory.

(Exodus 25:19) 
Let one cherub be on one end and the other cherub on the other end. From the two ends of the propitiatory, you shall make the cherubim.

(Exodus 25:20) 
The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the propitiatory with their wings, and they shall face each other, with their faces turned toward the propitiatory, which is to cover the Ark.

(Exodus 25:21) 
You shall place the propitiatory on top of the Ark, and in the Ark you shall put the testimony—the tablets—which I will give to you.

(Exodus 25:22) 
From there I will give you instructions, and I will speak to you from above the propitiatory—the mercy seat—and from between the two cherubim that are upon the Ark of the Testimony, concerning all that I will command you for the children of Israel.

(Exodus 25:23) 
You shall also make a table from acacia wood. Its length shall be two cubits, its width one cubit, and its height one and a half cubits.

(Exodus 25:24) 
You shall cover it with the purest gold, and make a golden crown—a molding—all around its edge.

(Exodus 25:25) 
You shall make a rim all around it, a handbreadth wide, and make a golden molding for the rim around it. Also, you shall make two gold rings for it, and place them on the four corners that are on its four legs.

(Exodus 25:26) 
The ring shall be under the rim, so that poles may be put into them, and the table may be carried.

(Exodus 25:27) 
You shall make these poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold, so that the table may be carried by them.

(Exodus 25:28) 
And on the table you shall always place the Bread of the Presence—the showbread—before Me.

(Exodus 25:29) 
You shall also make its dishes, its censers, its bowls, and its jars of pure gold, in which libations—drink offerings—are to be poured.

(Exodus 25:30) 
And on the table you shall always place the Bread of the Presence—the showbread—before Me.

(Exodus 25:31) 
You shall also make a lampstand of pure, hammered gold. Its base and its shaft, its cups, its ornamental knobs, and its lilies shall proceed from it as one piece.

(Exodus 25:32) 
Six branches shall extend from its sides: three branches of the lampstand from one side, and three branches from the other side.

(Exodus 25:33) 
Three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily, shall be on one branch. And similarly, three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily, shall be on the next branch. This pattern applies to all six branches that extend from the lampstand's central shaft.

(Exodus 25:34) 
And on the central shaft of the lampstand, there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily.

(Exodus 25:35) 
There shall also be an ornamental knob under each pair of the six branches that extend from the central shaft of the lampstand.

(Exodus 25:36) 
Their ornamental knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with the lampstand; all of it shall be one piece of pure, hammered gold.

(Exodus 25:37) 
You shall also make its seven lamps, and set them on the lampstand so that they give light in front of it.

(Exodus 25:38) 
Its snuffers and its trays—for the wicks and soot from the lamps—shall also be of purest gold.

(Exodus 25:39) 
All these vessels which we have mentioned shall be made from a talent of purest gold.

(Exodus 25:40) 
Look carefully and make them according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.

(Exodus 26:1) 
You shall then make the Tabernacle itself—the sacred dwelling place—from ten curtains. These curtains are to be woven from fine twisted linen, along with blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, skillfully crafted with artistic designs.

(Exodus 26:2) 
Each one of these curtains is to be twenty-eight cubits long, which is about forty-two feet, and four cubits wide, which is about six feet. All the curtains will have the exact same measurements.

(Exodus 26:3) 
Five of these curtains are to be joined together to form one large sheet, and the other five curtains will likewise be joined together to form a second large sheet.

(Exodus 26:4) 
You shall also make loops of blue thread along the edge of the first set of five curtains, and similar loops along the edge of the second set of five curtains, on the sides where they will be joined.

(Exodus 26:5) 
You are to make fifty loops on the edge of one large curtain sheet, and fifty loops on the edge of the other large curtain sheet. These loops should be directly opposite each other, so that one sheet can be joined to the other.

(Exodus 26:6) 
Then you will make fifty golden clasps. With these clasps, you will join the loops of the curtains, and in this way, the two large sheets will become one complete Tabernacle covering.

(Exodus 26:7) 
You will also make an outer covering for the Tabernacle from eleven curtains woven from goat hair.

(Exodus 26:8) 
Each one of these goat hair curtains is to be thirty cubits long, which is about forty-five feet, and four cubits wide, which is about six feet. All the goat hair curtains will have the exact same measurements.

(Exodus 26:9) 
You will join five of these goat hair curtains together into one section, and the other six curtains into a second section, so that the sixth curtain in this second section will be folded over at the very front of the Tabernacle, providing extra coverage.

(Exodus 26:10) 
You shall make fifty loops along the edge of one section of goat hair curtains, and fifty loops along the edge of the other section of goat hair curtains, so that they can be joined together.

(Exodus 26:11) 
And you will make fifty bronze clasps, which you will use to join the loops. In this way, the two sections of goat hair curtains will form one unified roof covering.

(Exodus 26:12) 
The surplus fabric from the goat hair covering, specifically one cubit from each side, will hang down over the sides of the Tabernacle.

(Exodus 26:13) 
And the extra cubit of length from each end of the roof covering for the Tabernacle will cover both sides of the Tabernacle structure, extending fully over it.

(Exodus 26:14) 
You shall also make an additional covering for the Tabernacle from rams' skins dyed red, and above that, another covering made from fine leather.

(Exodus 26:15) 
You are to make the upright frames for the Tabernacle from acacia wood.

(Exodus 26:16) 
Each frame board will be ten cubits high, which is about fifteen feet, and two cubits wide, which is about three feet.

(Exodus 26:17) 
Each board will have two tenons at its bottom, like pegs, designed to fit into sockets, so that one board can be securely joined to another. You are to make all the boards for the Tabernacle this way.

(Exodus 26:18) 
Of these boards, twenty will be placed on the south side, facing the south wind.

(Exodus 26:19) 
You shall make forty silver bases to support these twenty boards. There will be two bases under each board, one for each of its tenons.

(Exodus 26:20) 
On the second side of the Tabernacle, which faces the north, there will also be twenty boards.

(Exodus 26:21) 
And for these, you will make forty silver bases, with two bases under each board.

(Exodus 26:22) 
For the west side of the Tabernacle, you are to make six boards.

(Exodus 26:23) 
And you will make two additional boards for the corners of the Tabernacle at the rear. These corner boards will be joined from the bottom all the way to the top and meet perfectly at the corner with a pivot-like joint. This is how it will be done for both corners.

(Exodus 26:24) 
These boards will be joined securely from the bottom up to the very top, meeting together in a single unit at the top and by means of a precise hinge. This design will be applied to both parts and both corners, ensuring stability.

(Exodus 26:25) 
So, for the west side and its corners, there will be a total of eight boards, and sixteen silver bases, with two bases under each board.

(Exodus 26:26) 
You shall also make crossbars from acacia wood: five bars to hold together the boards on one side of the Tabernacle.

(Exodus 26:27) 
And five bars for the boards on the other side of the Tabernacle, and five bars for the west side, which is the rear of the Tabernacle.

(Exodus 26:28) 
The middle crossbar will run all the way through the centers of the boards, from one end to the other, providing continuous strength.

(Exodus 26:29) 
You are to overlay the boards themselves with pure gold, and you will cast golden rings to serve as holders, through which the crossbars will be passed. And you shall also overlay the crossbars themselves with pure gold.

(Exodus 26:30) 
You are to set up the Tabernacle exactly according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.

(Exodus 26:31) 
You shall also make an inner veil from blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, along with fine twisted linen. It must be skillfully woven with intricate embroidery, showing various artistic designs.

(Exodus 26:32) 
You will hang this veil by golden rings upon four pillars made of acacia wood. These pillars are themselves to be overlaid with gold and set into silver bases.

(Exodus 26:33) 
Inside this veil, you are to place the Ark of the Testimony. The veil will then serve as the division between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, separating these two sacred areas.

(Exodus 26:34) 
You shall also place the Mercy Seat upon the Ark of the Testimony within the Most Holy Place itself.

(Exodus 26:35) 
You are to place the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, with the table itself on the north side.

(Exodus 26:36) 
You shall also make a screen for the entrance of the Tabernacle, using blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, along with fine twisted linen, all expertly embroidered.

(Exodus 26:37) 
And for this screen, you will make five pillars of acacia wood, which are to be overlaid with gold. Their capitals—the decorative tops—will also be golden, and you shall cast bronze bases for them.

(Exodus 27:1) 
You shall also make an altar out of acacia wood. It must be five cubits long and five cubits wide, so it will be square, and it must be three cubits high.

(Exodus 27:2) 
Make four horn-like projections extending from its four corners, all of it made from the same wood. Then cover the entire altar and its horns with bronze.

(Exodus 27:3) 
You shall also make all the necessary tools for the altar: pans for removing the ashes, shovels, meat forks, and fire pans. All these tools must be made of bronze.

(Exodus 27:4) 
You shall also make a bronze grate for it, designed like a net, and attach four bronze rings to its four corners.

(Exodus 27:5) 
You must place this bronze grate below the lower rim of the altar, extending halfway up the altar itself.

(Exodus 27:6) 
You shall also make carrying poles for the altar out of acacia wood, and cover these poles with bronze.

(Exodus 27:7) 
These poles are to be inserted through the rings on the altar, so they extend from both sides, allowing the altar to be carried.

(Exodus 27:8) 
You must make this altar hollow and empty on the inside, not solid, exactly as it was shown to you on the mountain.

(Exodus 27:9) 
You shall also make a courtyard for the Tent of Meeting. On its south side, there will be hangings made of finely twisted linen, a hundred cubits long on that one side.

(Exodus 27:10) 
For this, there will be twenty posts with twenty bronze bases, and the tops of these posts, along with their connecting rods, shall be made of silver.

(Exodus 27:11) 
Similarly, for the north side, there will be hangings a hundred cubits long, along with twenty posts, the same number of bronze bases, and silver tops for the posts and their connecting rods.

(Exodus 27:12) 
For the width of the courtyard, facing west, there will be hangings fifty cubits long, with ten posts and ten bases.

(Exodus 27:13) 
For the width of the courtyard that faces east, it will also be fifty cubits.

(Exodus 27:14) 
On one side of the entrance, there will be hangings ten cubits long, with three posts and three bases.

(Exodus 27:15) 
And on the other side of the entrance, there will also be hangings ten cubits long, with three posts and three bases.

(Exodus 27:16) 
At the entrance of the courtyard, you shall make a screen of twenty cubits in height, crafted from blue, purple, and scarlet material, and finely twisted linen, embroidered with designs. For this screen, there will be four posts and four bases.

(Exodus 27:17) 
All the posts around the perimeter of the courtyard shall be joined with silver connecting rods and have silver caps, and all their bases will be bronze.

(Exodus 27:18) 
The courtyard will be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. Its hangings will be five cubits high, made of finely twisted linen, and all the bases of its posts shall be bronze.

(Exodus 27:19) 
All the tools for the Tent of Meeting, used for every service and ceremony, and all its pegs, as well as the pegs for the courtyard, must be made of bronze.

(Exodus 27:20) 
Command the sons of Israel to bring you the purest and clearest olive oil, so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.

(Exodus 27:21) 
In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that screens the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend these lamps so they burn from evening until morning before the Lord. This is a perpetual decree for the generations of the sons of Israel.

(Exodus 28:1) 
You are to bring to yourself, Moses, your brother Aaron along with his sons from among the children of Israel. They are to perform the sacred office of priest for me: Aaron, Nadab, Abiu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

(Exodus 28:2) 
You shall then make sacred garments for Aaron your brother, which are for his glory and for his beauty.

(Exodus 28:3) 
And you shall speak to all those with wise hearts, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. They are to make Aaron’s garments, in which he will be consecrated and minister to me.

(Exodus 28:4) 
These are the garments which are to be made: the breastplate, the ephod, the priestly robe, the finely woven tunic, the turban, and the sash. They shall make these sacred garments for Aaron your brother and for his sons, so that they may perform the sacred office of priest for me.

(Exodus 28:5) 
They shall bring gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn that is dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.

(Exodus 28:6) 
You shall make the ephod from gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen, crafted with skillful weaving.

(Exodus 28:7) 
You shall attach two shoulder pieces to its two sides, joining them together.

(Exodus 28:8) 
The woven band of the ephod itself, which is a single piece, shall be made of the same skillful craftsmanship and materials: gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.

(Exodus 28:9) 
You shall take two onyx stones and engrave upon them the names of the children of Israel:

(Exodus 28:10) 
Six names on one stone, and the remaining six names on the other stone, according to the order of their birth.

(Exodus 28:11) 
With the skill of an engraver, like those who carve precious stones, you shall engrave both stones with the names of the children of Israel, setting them in gold filigree and joining them securely.

(Exodus 28:12) 
You shall place these stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, to serve as a memorial for the children of Israel. Aaron shall carry their names before the Lord upon both his shoulders, as a constant remembrance.

(Exodus 28:13) 
You shall also make two settings of gold,

(Exodus 28:14) 
and two chains of pure gold, woven like cords and intertwined with each other, which you shall fasten to the gold settings.

(Exodus 28:15) 
You shall also make the breastplate of judgment, crafted with the same skillful weaving as the ephod, from gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.

(Exodus 28:16) 
It shall be square and doubled over, measuring a span in length and a span in width.

(Exodus 28:17) 
You shall place in it four rows of precious stones. In the first row, there shall be a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald.

(Exodus 28:18) 
In the second row, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.

(Exodus 28:19) 
In the third row, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.

(Exodus 28:20) 
In the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl. These stones shall be set in gold filigree and securely joined.

(Exodus 28:21) 
There shall be twelve stones, each engraved with the name of one of the children of Israel, corresponding to each of the twelve tribes.

(Exodus 28:22) 
For the breastplate, you shall make chains of pure gold, crafted like cords and intertwined with each other, just as you did for the ephod.

(Exodus 28:23) 
You shall put these chains through two rings, which are to be on each side of the breastplate.

(Exodus 28:24) 
You shall also put two other gold chains into two rings that are to be at the top of the ephod, on its front side.

(Exodus 28:25) 
Then you shall join these chains to the gold settings that are on the front of the ephod's shoulder pieces.

(Exodus 28:26) 
You shall also make two gold rings, which you shall place at the two lower ends of the breastplate, on the inner edge that faces the ephod.

(Exodus 28:27) 
And two other gold rings you shall place on each side of the ephod, below, at its lower joint, on the front, and above the woven band of the ephod.

(Exodus 28:28) 
You shall join the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that the breastplate remains securely attached and cannot become loose from the ephod.

(Exodus 28:29) 
And Aaron shall carry all the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his chest whenever he enters the sanctuary. This will be a perpetual memorial before the Lord.

(Exodus 28:30) 
You shall put the Urim and the Thummim into the breastplate of judgment. These sacred objects are to be on Aaron's chest when he enters before the Lord. Thus, Aaron shall always carry the means of discerning God's judgment for the children of Israel upon his chest before the Lord.

(Exodus 28:31) 
You shall make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue thread.

(Exodus 28:32) 
There shall be an opening for the head in its middle, with a woven border around this opening, like the collar of a woven garment, so that it will not easily tear.

(Exodus 28:33) 
At the bottom hem of the robe, you shall make pomegranates of blue thread, purple thread, and scarlet yarn dyed twice, all around the hem. And in between these pomegranates, you shall place gold bells.

(Exodus 28:34) 
The pattern shall be a gold bell, then a pomegranate, then a gold bell, then a pomegranate, and so on, all around the hem of the robe.

(Exodus 28:35) 
Aaron shall wear this robe when he ministers as a priest, so that the sound of the bells is heard when he enters and exits the sanctuary before the Lord. This is to ensure his safety and prevent his death while ministering in God's presence.

(Exodus 28:36) 
You shall also make a plate of pure gold, and engrave upon it, as one engraves a seal, the words: 'Holy to the Lord'.

(Exodus 28:37) 
You shall fasten this plate with a blue cord, and it shall be worn upon the turban,

(Exodus 28:38) 
on Aaron’s forehead. Aaron shall bear the iniquities connected with the holy offerings, those consecrated by the children of Israel, in all their sacred gifts and oblations. This gold plate shall always be on his forehead, so that the Lord may be gracious to the Israelites, accepting their offerings and forgiving any unintended sin in their sacred acts.

(Exodus 28:39) 
You shall also make the turban of fine linen, and you shall weave the finely checkered tunic with embroidered needlework.

(Exodus 28:40) 
Furthermore, for Aaron's sons, you shall make linen tunics, sashes, and caps, for their glory and for their beauty.

(Exodus 29:1) 
Now, this is the ritual you shall perform to consecrate Aaron and his sons, so they may serve Me as priests. From the herd, take one young bull; also take two rams that are physically perfect and without blemish.

(Exodus 29:2) 
From the finest wheat flour, you shall bake unleavened bread, as well as cakes made without yeast but mixed with oil. Also, make unleavened wafers that are brushed with oil.

(Exodus 29:3) 
Place all these baked goods into one basket, and then present that basket to God. You shall also present the young bull and the two rams for the sacred offerings.

(Exodus 29:4) 
Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, the sacred dwelling where God’s presence is made known. There, you shall ritually cleanse them by washing them with water.

(Exodus 29:5) 
Then, you shall dress Aaron in his consecrated priestly garments. These include the long tunic, the ephod (a special outer garment), and the breastpiece. You must secure the ephod and breastpiece with its woven sash.

(Exodus 29:6) 
Next, place the priestly turban upon Aaron’s head, and fasten the sacred golden plate, inscribed with 'Holy to the Lord,' onto the front of the turban.

(Exodus 29:7) 
Afterward, pour the special anointing oil generously upon Aaron’s head. Through this sacred anointing ritual, Aaron will be fully consecrated and set apart for God’s service.

(Exodus 29:8) 
Bring Aaron’s sons forward also, and dress them in their tunics, the long white priestly garments.

(Exodus 29:9) 
You shall tie sashes around both Aaron and his sons. Then, place turbans on the heads of Aaron’s sons. By this ceremony, they will become My priests according to an eternal, unchangeable law. After you have fully ordained them through this hand-consecrating ceremony,

(Exodus 29:10) 
You shall bring the young bull, designated for the purification offering, to the front of the Tabernacle of Testimony. There, Aaron and his sons will lay their hands firmly upon the bull’s head, signifying the transfer of sin.

(Exodus 29:11) 
You shall then slaughter the bull in the presence of the Lord, right at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony.

(Exodus 29:12) 
Take some of the bull’s blood and, with your finger, smear it onto the four horns of the altar of burnt offering. Then, pour all the remaining blood from the bull at the base of the altar.

(Exodus 29:13) 
Take all the fat that covers the bull’s internal organs, including the fatty lobe that is on the liver, and both kidneys with their surrounding fat. You are to burn these parts on the altar as a smoke offering.

(Exodus 29:14) 
However, the bull’s flesh, its hide, and its dung you must carry outside the camp and burn completely with fire, because this animal serves as a purification offering to atone for sins.

(Exodus 29:15) 
Next, you shall take one of the rams, designated for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head, signifying dedication to God.

(Exodus 29:16) 
Once you have slaughtered this ram, take its blood and pour it all around the altar of burnt offering.

(Exodus 29:17) 
Cut the ram’s body into its separate pieces. Then, wash its internal organs and its legs thoroughly with water. Afterward, arrange these washed parts, along with the head and all the other cut pieces, on the altar to be burned.

(Exodus 29:18) 
You shall offer the entire ram as a burnt offering, completely consumed by fire to the Lord. This is a burnt offering for the Lord, a pleasing aroma that signifies God’s acceptance, an offering given entirely to the Lord.

(Exodus 29:19) 
Now, take the second ram, the ram designated for the ordination ceremony. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head.

(Exodus 29:20) 
When you have slaughtered this ram, take some of its blood. With your finger, put a small amount of blood on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and on the lobes of his sons’ right ears. Also, put blood on the thumb of their right hands and on the great toe of their right feet. The rest of the blood you shall pour all around the altar of burnt offering.

(Exodus 29:21) 
Then, take some of the blood that is on the altar and mix it with some of the anointing oil. Sprinkle this mixture upon Aaron and his priestly garments, and upon his sons and their priestly garments. In this way, Aaron and his sons, along with their garments, shall all be fully consecrated and made holy.

(Exodus 29:22) 
From the ram of ordination, you shall take the fat tail, the fat that covers the internal organs, the fatty lobe of the liver, both kidneys with their surrounding fat, and the right thigh. These are specific parts for the ram used in this priestly consecration ceremony.

(Exodus 29:23) 
Also, from the basket of unleavened bread that is placed before the Lord, take one loaf of bread made with oil, one unleavened cake, and one unleavened wafer.

(Exodus 29:24) 
Place all these items—the meat portions and the breads—upon the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then, you shall perform the wave offering, holding their hands as you present these consecrated things before the Lord.

(Exodus 29:25) 
After the wave offering, take all the items from their hands and burn them completely on the altar of burnt offering. This will be a pleasing aroma before the Lord, for it is a special offering given to the Lord.

(Exodus 29:26) 
You shall take the breast from the ram of ordination, which is designated for Aaron, and present it as a wave offering before the Lord. This breast will then become your designated portion, Moses.

(Exodus 29:27) 
You shall consecrate the breast that was waved as a wave offering, and the thigh that was presented as a heave offering. These portions have been set apart from the ram for both Aaron and his sons.

(Exodus 29:28) 
These portions shall be a perpetual entitlement for Aaron and his sons from the people of Israel. For they are a wave offering and a heave offering, taken from the peace offerings that the Israelites present to the Lord, designating them as holy sustenance for the priests.

(Exodus 29:29) 
The holy garments that Aaron wears as high priest shall be passed down to his sons who succeed him. They are to be anointed in these very garments, and their hands consecrated, as part of their own ordination.

(Exodus 29:30) 
The son who is appointed priest in Aaron’s place, and who enters the Tabernacle of Testimony to minister in the Holy Place, must wear these garments for seven consecutive days.

(Exodus 29:31) 
You shall also take the ram that was used for the ordination ceremony and cook its meat in a sacred area within the Tabernacle courtyard.

(Exodus 29:32) 
Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of that ram, along with the bread from the basket, at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony. This shared meal is an integral part of their consecration.

(Exodus 29:33) 
They shall eat these things because they were offered to make atonement for their ordination and to consecrate them. No unauthorized person, no one outside the priestly family, may eat of these consecrated items, because they are holy and set apart for God.

(Exodus 29:34) 
If any of the consecrated meat or any of the bread remains until the morning, you must burn the leftovers completely with fire. They are not to be eaten, because they have been made holy and cannot be kept overnight.

(Exodus 29:35) 
You shall carry out all these commands precisely as I have instructed regarding Aaron and his sons. For seven full days, you shall perform the full ordination ceremony, consecrating their hands for service.

(Exodus 29:36) 
Moreover, each day of these seven days, you shall offer a young bull as a sin offering to make atonement for the priests. When you offer this sacrificial atonement, you shall also purify the altar and anoint it with oil to consecrate it, making it holy for God.

(Exodus 29:37) 
For seven days, you shall perform atonement for the altar and consecrate it. After this, the altar will be most holy, a true holy of holies. Everything and everyone who touches that consecrated altar shall become holy, absorbing its sacred status.

(Exodus 29:38) 
Now, this is what you shall offer on the altar regularly and continually: two lambs, each one year old, every single day.

(Exodus 29:39) 
One lamb is to be offered in the morning, and the other lamb in the evening, establishing a daily rhythm of worship.

(Exodus 29:40) 
With the first lamb, you shall offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of pressed oil. And with each lamb, there shall be a drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine, poured out before the Lord.

(Exodus 30:1) 
You shall construct an altar for the burning of incense; you must make this altar from durable acacia wood.

(Exodus 30:2) 
Its length will be one cubit, and its width one cubit, meaning it will be square. Its height will be two cubits. Its horns, a part of its construction, will extend upwards from it.

(Exodus 30:3) 
You shall cover it with the purest gold, both its top and its sides, and its horns. And you shall make a golden rim around its top.

(Exodus 30:4) 
And you shall place two golden rings below the rim on its opposite sides, so that poles may be inserted into them, and the altar can be carried by these poles.

(Exodus 30:5) 
You shall also make these poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold.

(Exodus 30:6) 
You shall place this altar in front of the veil that hangs before the Ark of the Testimony. It will be positioned before the atonement cover that shields the Testimony, which is the very place where I will speak with you.

(Exodus 30:7) 
And Aaron shall burn upon this altar a most fragrant incense every morning. When he prepares the lamps, he shall light the incense upon it.

(Exodus 30:8) 
And when he sets up the lamps in the evening, he shall burn incense again, a perpetual offering before the Lord throughout all your generations.

(Exodus 30:9) 
You shall not offer upon it any other compounded incense, nor any burnt offering, nor any grain offering. Nor shall you pour out any drink offerings upon it.

(Exodus 30:10) 
And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once each year with the blood from the sin offering. He shall purify it and consecrate it throughout your generations; it shall be most holy to the Lord.

(Exodus 30:11) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:

(Exodus 30:12) 
When you take a census of the sons of Israel according to their numbers, each one shall give a ransom for his soul to the Lord, so that no plague may come upon them when they are counted.

(Exodus 30:13) 
This is what everyone who is counted shall give: half a shekel, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs). This half-shekel portion shall be offered to the Lord.

(Exodus 30:14) 
Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and above, shall give this ransom.

(Exodus 30:15) 
The rich shall not give more, nor shall the poor give less than the half-shekel, when they give the ransom for their souls to the Lord.

(Exodus 30:16) 
You shall receive this money of atonement from the sons of Israel and dedicate it for the service of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. It shall be a memorial offering from the sons of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for their souls.

(Exodus 30:17) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:

(Exodus 30:18) 
You shall also construct a bronze basin with its bronze stand for washing. You shall place it between the Tabernacle of the Testimony and the altar. And you shall put water in it.

(Exodus 30:19) 
Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.

(Exodus 30:20) 
When they are about to enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and when they are about to approach the altar to offer incense to the Lord, they must wash so that they do not die.

(Exodus 30:21) 
When they wash their hands and feet, they shall not enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony, nor shall they approach the altar to offer a fragrant offering to the Lord, lest they die. This ritual washing shall be a perpetual religious law for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations.

(Exodus 30:22) 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:

(Exodus 30:23) 
Take the finest spices: five hundred shekels of liquid myrrh, two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant calamus.

(Exodus 30:24) 
Also, take five hundred shekels of cassia, and one hin of olive oil.

(Exodus 30:25) 
And from these ingredients, you shall make holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment skillfully compounded by a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.

(Exodus 30:26) 
With this oil, you shall anoint the Tabernacle of the Testimony and the Ark of the Testimony.

(Exodus 30:27) 
You shall also anoint the table with all its vessels, and the lampstand with all its accessories.

(Exodus 30:28) 
You shall anoint both the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offerings, along with all the vessels that pertain to their service.

(Exodus 30:29) 
You shall consecrate all these items, and they will become most holy. Everyone who touches them will be made holy by contact.

(Exodus 30:30) 
You shall also anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall consecrate them so that they may serve Me as priests.

(Exodus 30:31) 
You shall also speak to the sons of Israel, saying: This holy anointing oil shall be set apart for Me throughout your generations.

(Exodus 30:32) 
The body of a common person shall not be anointed with it, and you shall not make any other oil with a similar composition. Because it has been consecrated, it shall remain holy to you.

(Exodus 30:33) 
Whoever makes anything like it, or puts any of it on a foreigner, shall be cut off from his people.

(Exodus 30:34) 
The Lord also said to Moses: Take for yourself fragrant spices—liquid storax, onycha, sweet-smelling galbanum, and pure frankincense. All these spices must be of equal weight.

(Exodus 30:35) 
And from these, you shall make compounded incense, the work of a perfumer, carefully blended, pure, and worthy of consecration.

(Exodus 30:36) 
When you have ground it very finely, you shall place some of it before the Tabernacle of the Testimony, where I will speak with you. This incense shall be most holy to you.

(Exodus 30:37) 
The incense that is made with this precise composition, you shall not make for yourselves, but you shall keep it consecrated exclusively for the Lord.

(Exodus 30:38) 
Whoever makes anything like it simply to enjoy its fragrance shall be cut off from his people.

(Exodus 30:39)

(Exodus 30:40) 
N/A

(Exodus 31:1) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

(Exodus 31:2) 
Look, I have specifically called Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, by name.

(Exodus 31:3) 
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, endowing him with wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge for every kind of work,

(Exodus 31:4) 
to devise all sorts of intricate designs that can be crafted, and for the work of joining pieces together, and to work with gold, and silver, and bronze.

(Exodus 31:5) 
and in the carving of marble, and various other stones, and in carpentry work, and for devising any type of artistic skill imaginable.

(Exodus 31:6) 
I Myself have given him a companion, Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan.

(Exodus 31:7) 
and in the heart of every skilled artisan, I have placed wisdom, so that they may accomplish everything I have commanded you:

(Exodus 31:8) 
the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and the Ark of the Testimony, and the Mercy Seat which is upon it, and all the furnishings of the Tabernacle,

(Exodus 31:9) 
and the table with its utensils, and the lampstand of pure gold with its utensils, and the altar of incense,

(Exodus 31:10) 
and the altar of burnt offerings with its utensils, and all the other implements of the Tabernacle,

(Exodus 31:11) 
and also the sacred priestly vestments for Bezaleel for his priestly duties, and the garments for the other ministers,

(Exodus 31:12) 
and the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense for the holy place.

(Exodus 31:13) 
They shall make everything that I have commanded you.

(Exodus 31:14) 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: 'You must carefully observe My Sabbaths, because it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.'"

(Exodus 31:15) 
You must keep the Sabbath holy, because it is consecrated to you. Whoever profanes it shall surely be put to death. Anyone who performs any work on it, that person's soul shall be cut off from among their people.

(Exodus 31:16) 
For six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath, a holy rest for the Lord. Anyone who does any work on this day shall die.

(Exodus 31:17) 
So the children of Israel must keep the Sabbath, and celebrate it throughout their generations. It is an everlasting covenant between Me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign: because in six days the Lord created the universe and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested from His work and refreshed Himself.

(Exodus 32:1) 
The people of Israel saw that Moses was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, so they gathered together against Aaron and said to him: "Stand up and make us gods to lead us, because as for this Moses, the man who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him."

(Exodus 32:2) 
Then Aaron said to them: "Take off the gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."

(Exodus 32:3) 
So all the people did as he commanded and brought their earrings to Aaron.

(Exodus 32:4) 
When he had received the gold from their hands, he formed it with a melting and shaping process and made a molten calf. Then they said: "These are your gods, O Israel, who led you out of the land of Egypt."

(Exodus 32:5) 
When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf. He then proclaimed in a loud voice to all the people: "Tomorrow is a feast day for the Lord God!"

(Exodus 32:6) 
The next morning, the people rose early and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then the people sat down to eat and drink, and afterward, they stood up to indulge in revelry.

(Exodus 32:7) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Moses, saying: "Go down from the mountain! For your people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt, have sinned greatly."

(Exodus 32:8) 
They have quickly turned aside from the way that I showed them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and they have worshipped it and offered sacrifices to it, saying: "These are your gods, O Israel, who led you out of the land of Egypt!"

(Exodus 32:9) 
And again the Lord God said to Moses: "I see that this people is stubborn and stiff-necked."

(Exodus 32:10) 
"Now, leave me alone, so that my burning wrath may rage against them, and I may destroy them. And I will make you into a great nation instead."

(Exodus 32:11) 
But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God, saying: "Why, O Lord, should your burning wrath rage against your own people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?"

(Exodus 32:12) 
"Please do not let the Egyptians say: 'He cunningly led them out only to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the face of the earth.' Let your anger subside, and be merciful regarding the evil of your people."

(Exodus 32:13) 
"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your very self, saying: 'I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the sky, and all this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants, and they will possess it forever.'"

(Exodus 32:14) 
And the Lord God relented from doing the harm that He had threatened against His people.

(Exodus 32:15) 
Moses then turned and came down from the mountain, holding the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, inscribed on both sides, front and back.

(Exodus 32:16) 
They were written by the very finger of God, and engraved with His work upon the tablets.

(Exodus 32:17) 
When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses: "The sound of battle cries is heard in the camp!"

(Exodus 32:18) 
Moses replied: "That is not the sound of those encouraging a battle, nor the cry of those provoking flight. Rather, I hear the sound of singing."

(Exodus 32:19) 
As he approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Enraged, he threw the tablets from his hands and smashed them at the foot of the mountain.

(Exodus 32:20) 
He then took the calf they had made, burned it with fire, and ground it into powder. He scattered the powder into water and made the children of Israel drink it.

(Exodus 32:21) 
And Moses said to Aaron: "What did this people do to you, that you brought such a great sin upon them?"

(Exodus 32:22) 
Aaron replied to him: "Do not be angry, my lord. For you yourself know this people, that they are prone to evil."

(Exodus 32:23) 
"They said to me: 'Make us gods to lead us, because as for this Moses, the man who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'"

(Exodus 32:24) 
"So I said to them: 'Who among you has gold?' They took it off and gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out!"

(Exodus 32:25) 
Moses then saw that the people were exposed and defenseless, for Aaron had stripped them bare and disgraced them before their enemies.

(Exodus 32:26) 
So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp and said: "Whoever is for the Lord God, let him join me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.

(Exodus 32:27) 
He said to them: "Thus says the Lord God of Israel: 'Let each man put his sword on his thigh. Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and let each man kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.'"

(Exodus 32:28) 
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and on that day, about twenty-three thousand men fell dead.

(Exodus 32:29) 
And Moses said: "You have consecrated yourselves today for the Lord God, each man against his own son and his own brother, so that a blessing may be given to you."

(Exodus 32:30) 
Now on the next day, Moses spoke to the people: "You have committed a very great sin. I will go up to the Lord God; perhaps I can make atonement for your wickedness."

(Exodus 32:31) 
Then he returned to the Lord God and said: "Oh, Lord, I beg you, this people has committed a great sin, for they have made for themselves gods of gold!"

(Exodus 32:32) 
"Now, either forgive them this guilt, or if you will not, then erase me from your book which you have written!"

(Exodus 32:33) 
The Lord God replied to him: "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I erase from my book."

(Exodus 32:34) 
"Now therefore, go and lead this people to the place of which I have spoken to you. My angel will go before you. For on the day of my vengeance, I will indeed punish them for this sin also."

(Exodus 32:35) 
So the Lord God struck the people with a plague because of the wickedness they had committed in making the calf, which Aaron had made.

(Exodus 33:1) 
The Lord also said to Moses: "Go up from this place—you and your people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: 'To your offspring I will give it.'"

(Exodus 33:2) 
"And I will send an angel ahead of you to drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,

(Exodus 33:3) 
to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up with you, because you are a stiff-necked people—lest I destroy you on the way."

(Exodus 33:4) 
When the people heard this very harsh message, they mourned, and no one put on their ornaments of joy.

(Exodus 33:5) 
And the Lord said to Moses: "Speak to the children of Israel: 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up among you for even one moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, so that I may know what I will do to you.'"

(Exodus 33:6) 
So the children of Israel removed their ornaments from themselves near Mount Horeb.

(Exodus 33:7) 
Moses also took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, far away, and called it "the Tent of Meeting" — or "Tabernacle of the Covenant". And everyone who sought the Lord would go out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.

(Exodus 33:8) 
And when Moses went out to the tabernacle, all the people would rise and stand, each at the entrance of his own tent, and watch Moses' back until he entered the tabernacle.

(Exodus 33:9) 
And when Moses had entered the Tent of Meeting, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tabernacle, and the Lord would speak with Moses.

(Exodus 33:10) 
All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tabernacle. And all stood and worshipped, each at the entrance of their own tents.

(Exodus 33:11) 
Now the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, just as a person speaks to a friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his assistant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tabernacle.

(Exodus 33:12) 
And Moses said to the Lord: "See, You are commanding me to lead out this people, yet You have not let me know whom You will send with me. You have also said: 'I know you by name, and you have found favor with Me.'"

(Exodus 33:13) 
"If, therefore, I have found favor in Your sight, show me Your presence, so that I may know You and continue to find favor in Your eyes. Consider this people—Your very own nation."

(Exodus 33:14) 
And the Lord said: "My presence shall go before you, and I will give you rest."

(Exodus 33:15) 
And Moses replied: "If You Your very self do not go before us, do not lead us up from this place."

(Exodus 33:16) 
"For by what shall it be known that I and Your family—Your people—have found favor in Your sight, unless You walk with us? This is how we will be greatly honored by all the peoples who dwell upon the earth."

(Exodus 33:17) 
And the Lord said to Moses: "Even this very request that you have spoken, I will do; for you have found favor before Me, and I know you by name."

(Exodus 33:18) 
And Moses said: "Show me Your glory!"

(Exodus 33:19) 
The Lord responded: "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I please."

(Exodus 33:20) 
And again He said: "You cannot see My divine presence, for no human being can see Me and live."

(Exodus 33:21) 
And again He said: "Behold, there is a place near Me, and you shall stand upon the rock."

(Exodus 33:22) 
"And when My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand until I have passed by."

(Exodus 33:23) 
"Then I will take away My hand, and you will see My back—meaning My after-effect or the manifestation of My presence after I have passed—but My divine presence you cannot see."

(Exodus 34:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Hew two stone tablets for yourself, exactly like the first ones were, and I will write upon them the exact same words that were on the first tablets, the ones you broke.'

(Exodus 34:2) 
Be ready in the morning, so you can immediately ascend Mount Sinai and stand with Me at the very summit of the mountain.

(Exodus 34:3) 
No one else is to ascend with you, and no one else is to be seen anywhere on the mountain. Furthermore, no cattle or sheep are to graze facing that mountain.

(Exodus 34:4) 
So Moses hewed two stone tablets, just like the previous ones had been. Rising early in the night, he ascended Mount Sinai, exactly as the Lord had commanded him, carrying the tablets with him.

(Exodus 34:5) 
And when the Lord descended in the cloud, Moses stood with Him, calling upon the very Name of the Lord.

(Exodus 34:6) 
As He passed by Moses, He declared: 'The Lord, the Lord God—He is full of mercy and tenderness, ever-patient, abounding in steadfast love, and perfectly truthful.'

(Exodus 34:7) 
—He who keeps mercy for thousands of generations, and takes away wickedness, and crimes, and all sins, though no one is inherently innocent before Him—He who repays the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and the children's children, even to the third and fourth generation.

(Exodus 34:8) 
Moses immediately bowed down to the ground, prostrating himself, and worshipped God,

(Exodus 34:9) 
saying, 'If I have found favor in Your sight, Lord, I beg you to walk among us—even though Your people are stubborn and rebellious—and take away our iniquities and our sins, and make us Your very own possession.'

(Exodus 34:10) 
The Lord answered: 'I will now enter into a solemn covenant with you before all of your people. I will perform wonders that have never before been done on the earth, nor among any other nation, so that this people, in whose midst you live, may see the awe-inspiring works of the Lord that I am about to do.'

(Exodus 34:11) 
Observe all that I am commanding you today: I myself will drive out from before you the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

(Exodus 34:12) 
Be careful never to make a covenant with the inhabitants of that land, lest they later become your ruin. Instead, you must destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and cut down their pagan groves.

(Exodus 34:13) 
You are not to worship any foreign god; for the Lord, whose very Name is 'Jealous God,' is a God who demands absolute devotion.

(Exodus 34:14) 
Do not by any means make a covenant with the people of those regions, because when they commit spiritual fornication with their gods, and worship their idols, someone might call you to eat from their sacrifices.

(Exodus 34:15) 
Nor are you to take wives for your sons from among their daughters, lest when those women commit spiritual fornication, they also cause your sons to commit spiritual fornication with their gods.

(Exodus 34:16) 
You are not to make for yourselves any molten gods.

(Exodus 34:17) 
You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, just as I commanded you at the appointed time in the month of Abib—the month of new crops—for it was in the springtime that you came out of Egypt.

(Exodus 34:18) 
Every firstborn male that opens the womb is Mine. Of all the livestock, both cattle and sheep, every firstborn male is to be consecrated to Me.

(Exodus 34:19) 
The firstborn of a donkey you shall ransom with a lamb; but if you do not ransom it, then you must break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you shall ransom, and you are not to appear before My presence empty-handed.

(Exodus 34:20) 
You shall labor for six days, but on the seventh day you shall cease from plowing and from harvesting.

(Exodus 34:21) 
You are to keep the Feast of Weeks, which is the feast of the first fruits of your wheat harvest, and also the Feast of Ingathering, which occurs at the turn of the year when all the crops are gathered in.

(Exodus 34:22) 
Three times in a year, every male among you shall appear before the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Exodus 34:23) 
For when I have driven out the nations from before you and enlarged your territories, no one will plot against your land when you ascend and appear before the presence of the Lord your God three times in a year.

(Exodus 34:24) 
You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall any part of the Paschal lamb remain until morning.

(Exodus 34:25) 
You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

(Exodus 34:26) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Write these words for yourself, for it is by these very words that I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.'

(Exodus 34:27) 
So Moses was there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights. He ate no bread and drank no water. And on the tablets, God Himself wrote the ten words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.

(Exodus 34:28) 
Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, holding the two tablets of the Testimony—the covenant—he did not know that his face was emitting rays of light from his intimate communion with the Lord.

(Exodus 34:29) 
Aaron and the children of Israel saw that Moses' face was emitting rays of light, and they were afraid to approach him closely.

(Exodus 34:30) 
But Moses called them, so Aaron and the leaders of the assembly returned to him. And after he spoke to them,

(Exodus 34:31) 
all the children of Israel came near to him, and he commanded them all the things he had heard from the Lord on Mount Sinai.

(Exodus 34:32) 
And after he had finished speaking all the words, he put a veil over his face.

(Exodus 34:33) 
Whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would speak to the children of Israel all that had been commanded to him.

(Exodus 34:34) 
The children of Israel would see that Moses' face, as he came out, was emitting rays of light, and so he would put the veil over his face again until he went in to speak with the Lord.

(Exodus 34:35) 
The children of Israel would see that Moses' face, as he came out, was emitting rays of light, and so he would put the veil over his face again until he went in to speak with the Lord.

(Exodus 35:1) 
Moses then called together all the people of Israel and he told them: “Here are the things that God has commanded you to do:”

(Exodus 35:2) 
“You are to work for six days, but the seventh day will be holy for you. It is the Sabbath, a day of rest for the Lord. Anyone who does any work on that day will be put to death.”

(Exodus 35:3) 
“You must not light any fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”

(Exodus 35:4) 
Moses then spoke to all the people of Israel again, saying: “These are the commands that God has given you:”

(Exodus 35:5) 
“Set aside a sacred offering for the Lord. Everyone who is willing and eager to give with a generous heart should bring the Lord’s offering of gold, silver, bronze,”

(Exodus 35:6) 
“blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, fine linen, goat hair,”

(Exodus 35:7) 
“ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,”

(Exodus 35:8) 
“oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense,”

(Exodus 35:9) 
“and onyx stones and other jewels to be set into the High Priest’s ephod and breastplate.”

(Exodus 35:10) 
“Every skilled craftsman among you should come and make everything that the Lord has commanded for the Tabernacle:”

(Exodus 35:11) 
“the Tabernacle itself, its outer tent, its covering, the metal rings, the wooden frames, the crossbars, the pillars, and their bases,”

(Exodus 35:12) 
“the Ark of the Covenant, its carrying poles, the Ark’s lid (the Mercy Seat), and the curtain that hangs in front of it,”

(Exodus 35:13) 
“the table for the Bread of the Presence, its carrying poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence itself,”

(Exodus 35:14) 
“the lampstand for light, its accessories, its lamps, and the oil for lighting,”

(Exodus 35:15) 
“the altar of incense, its carrying poles, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the Tabernacle,”

(Exodus 35:16) 
“the altar for burnt offerings, its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and all its utensils; the basin and its stand,”

(Exodus 35:17) 
“the curtains for the courtyard, its pillars, their bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard,”

(Exodus 35:18) 
“the pegs for the Tabernacle and the courtyard, along with their ropes.”

(Exodus 35:19) 
“Also the beautifully woven priestly garments that will be used for ministering in the Holy Place: the sacred garments for Aaron, the High Priest, and the garments for his sons, so they can serve God as priests.”

(Exodus 35:20) 
After Moses finished speaking, all the people of Israel departed from him.

(Exodus 35:21) 
Then everyone whose heart was stirred and whose spirit was willing came and brought their offerings to the Lord for the work of the Tent of Meeting, which contained the Covenant, and for all the holy priestly garments.

(Exodus 35:22) 
Both men and women came. They brought brooches, earrings, rings, bracelets—every kind of gold object. Anyone who was able to bring an offering of gold for the Lord brought it.

(Exodus 35:23) 
And everyone who possessed blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, fine linen, goat hair, red-dyed ram skins, or fine leather brought them.

(Exodus 35:24) 
Everyone who was able to offer silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord. And everyone who had acacia wood for any purpose brought it.

(Exodus 35:25) 
All the women who were skilled in weaving crafted and spun the blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, and fine linen.

(Exodus 35:26) 
And all the women whose hearts were willing spun the goat hair.

(Exodus 35:27) 
The leaders of the tribes brought onyx stones and other jewels for the ephod and the breastplate,

(Exodus 35:28) 
along with spices and oil for the lamps, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.

(Exodus 35:29) 
All the men and women whose hearts willingly prompted them brought their gifts to the Lord, so that the work that God had commanded through Moses could be done.

(Exodus 35:30) 
Then Moses said to the people of Israel: “Look, God has specifically called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.”

(Exodus 35:31) 
“God has filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in every kind of craft.”

(Exodus 35:32) 
“He has given him the ability to design and create works of art using gold, silver, and bronze;”

(Exodus 35:33) 
“to engrave stones and set them, to carve wood, and to work in every type of skilled craftsmanship.”

(Exodus 35:34) 
“God has also put it in his heart, and in the heart of Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to teach others these skills.”

(Exodus 35:35) 
“He has endowed both of them with exceptional wisdom and skill to perform every kind of artistic work—such as engraving, weaving, and embroidering with blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, and fine linen, and to weave any kind of cloth, and to discover all sorts of new crafts.”

(Exodus 36:1) 
So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled craftsman—to whom the Lord had given wisdom and understanding so they would know how to perform all the work for the holy sanctuary—they did everything the Lord had commanded.

(Exodus 36:2) 
Then Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and every wise man whom God had gifted with wisdom, and all those who willingly came forward to perform the work.

(Exodus 36:3) 
Moses gave back to them all the funds and everything that the children of Israel had offered as gifts to construct the sanctuary. Yet, every single morning, the people continued to bring their offerings,

(Exodus 36:4) 
so the craftsmen who were engaged in the work of the sanctuary came forward.

(Exodus 36:5) 
They said to Moses, "The people are offering more than what is needed."

(Exodus 36:6) 
So Moses gave a command and sent out a proclamation, saying, "Let no man or woman offer anything more for the work of the sanctuary!" This is how the people were stopped from bringing gifts,

(Exodus 36:7) 
because what had already been offered was sufficient and even superabundant.

(Exodus 36:8) 
All the craftsmen who were wise of heart then began to complete the work of the tabernacle. They made ten curtains from fine twisted linen, blue fabric, purple fabric, and scarlet fabric dyed twice, crafted with varied and intricate artistic work.

(Exodus 36:9) 
Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains had the same measurement.

(Exodus 36:10) 
So they joined five of the curtains to one another, and the other five they also joined to one another.

(Exodus 36:11) 
They also made loops of blue material at the edge of each of the five connected curtains, on both sides, for joining them together.

(Exodus 36:12) 
There were fifty loops on one curtain set and fifty loops on the other, facing each other.

(Exodus 36:13) 
They made fifty golden clasps by which the edges of the curtains were joined, so that the tabernacle would become one unified structure.

(Exodus 36:14) 
They also made eleven curtains from goats' hair to cover the roof of the tabernacle.

(Exodus 36:15) 
Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains had the same measurement.

(Exodus 36:16) 
They joined five of these curtains by themselves, and the other six they joined by themselves.

(Exodus 36:17) 
They made fifty loops at the extreme edge of one set of joined curtains, and fifty loops at the extreme edge of the other set, so that they could be joined together.

(Exodus 36:18) 
They also made fifty bronze clasps, by which the loops of the covering could be joined, so that it would become one unified covering.

(Exodus 36:19) 
They also made coverings for the tabernacle from rams' skins dyed red, and another covering above that, made from blue skins.

(Exodus 36:20) 
They also made upright boards for the tabernacle from acacia wood.

(Exodus 36:21) 
The length of each board was ten cubits, and its width was one and a half cubits.

(Exodus 36:22) 
Each board had two tenons to connect one to the other; they made them this way for all the boards of the tabernacle.

(Exodus 36:23) 
They made twenty boards for the south side, which faces the south.

(Exodus 36:24) 
They made forty silver bases under each of the twenty boards—specifically, two bases under each tenon.

(Exodus 36:25) 
For the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty boards.

(Exodus 36:26) 
And they made forty silver bases, two bases under each board.

(Exodus 36:27) 
For the western side of the tabernacle, they made six boards.

(Exodus 36:28) 
And they made two boards for the back corners of the tabernacle,

(Exodus 36:29) 
which were joined together from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single connection. They made them this way on both sides for the corners,

(Exodus 36:30) 
so that there were eight boards in total, and sixteen silver bases, meaning two bases under each board.

(Exodus 36:31) 
They also made bars of acacia wood: five bars for holding together the boards on one side of the tabernacle,

(Exodus 36:32) 
five others for fitting to the boards of the other side, and also five for the western side of the tabernacle at the back.

(Exodus 36:33) 
They also made a central bar running through the middle of the boards, extending from one end to the other.

(Exodus 36:34) 
And they covered the boards themselves with sheets of gold, and made their bases of cast silver, and made golden rings through which the bars could be passed. The bars themselves were also covered with sheets of gold.

(Exodus 36:35) 
They also made a veil from blue fabric, purple fabric, and scarlet fabric dyed twice, and fine twisted linen, woven with intricate artistic work and skillful craft.

(Exodus 36:36) 
And they made four columns from acacia wood, which they covered with gold, and their bases were made of silver. Their hooks, however, were made of gold.

(Exodus 36:37) 
They also made a curtain for the entrance of the tabernacle, from blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric dyed twice, and fine twisted linen, all woven with needlework.

(Exodus 36:38) 
And they made five columns with their bases, which they covered with gold; their capitals and the decorative carvings were also gold. They also made five silver bases for these columns.

(Exodus 37:1) 
Now, Bezalel constructed the Ark of the Covenant using acacia wood. Its length was two and a half cubits, its width was one and a half cubits, and its height was also one and a half cubits.

(Exodus 37:2) 
He then overlaid the Ark, both inside and out, with pure gold. He also made a decorative molding of gold that went all around its top edge.

(Exodus 37:3) 
He cast four gold rings and fastened them to each of the four corners—two rings on one side and two on the opposite side.

(Exodus 37:4) 
He also made carrying poles from acacia wood, which he then overlaid with gold.

(Exodus 37:5) 
He inserted these poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark, so it could be carried.

(Exodus 37:6) 
He also made the Mercy Seat out of pure gold. It was two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.

(Exodus 37:7) 
He crafted two cherubim from hammered pure gold, placing one at each end of the Mercy Seat.

(Exodus 37:8) 
One cherub was on one end, and the other cherub on the opposite end. Their faces were turned towards each other, their wings were spread out over the Mercy Seat, and they were looking down at it, forming a unified piece with the Mercy Seat itself.

(Exodus 37:9) 
He also constructed the Table of the Presence using acacia wood. It was two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.

(Exodus 37:10) 
He covered the table with pure gold and fashioned a gold molding around its edge.

(Exodus 37:11) 
He made a rim for the table, four fingers wide, and overlaid it with gold. Above this rim, he added another gold molding.

(Exodus 37:12) 
He cast four gold rings and attached them to the four corners of the table, next to its legs.

(Exodus 37:13) 
These rings were positioned near the lower molding so that poles could be inserted through them to carry the table.

(Exodus 37:14) 
He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

(Exodus 37:15) 
He also made the seven-branched Lampstand of pure, hammered gold. All parts of it were formed and crafted from solid gold.

(Exodus 37:16) 
Its base, its central shaft, its branches, its cups, its decorative flower blossoms, and all its other elements were made of gold.

(Exodus 37:17) 
Six branches extended from its sides: three branches on one side and three branches on the other.

(Exodus 37:18) 
On each of the six branches, there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with their ornamental knobs and flower petals. The three cups on the other branch were also in the shape of almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals.

(Exodus 37:19) 
There were six branches extending from the central shaft of the Lampstand.

(Exodus 37:20) 
And on the central shaft itself, there were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, along with their knobs and petals.

(Exodus 37:21) 
There was a knob under each pair of the three sets of branches that extended from the Lampstand's main shaft.

(Exodus 37:22) 
All the knobs and stems were made of pure, hammered gold.

(Exodus 37:23) 
He also made the Lampstand's seven lamps, its snuffers, and its trays, all from pure gold.

(Exodus 37:24) 
He used a talent of pure gold for the Lampstand and all its associated implements.

(Exodus 37:25) 
He also made the Altar of Incense from acacia wood. It was square, one cubit long on each side, and two cubits high. Horns extended from its corners.

(Exodus 37:26) 
He overlaid the altar—its top, its sides, and its horns—with pure gold. He also made a gold molding around its top edge.

(Exodus 37:27) 
He cast two gold rings and placed them below the molding on two opposite sides, so that poles could be inserted through them to carry it.

(Exodus 37:28) 
He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

(Exodus 37:29) 
He also prepared the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, following the precise work of a perfumer.

(Exodus 37:30) 
He also constructed the Altar of Burnt Offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide, and three cubits high.

(Exodus 37:31) 
Its horns were an integral part of it, extending from its corners, and he overlaid the entire altar with bronze.

(Exodus 37:32) 
In the middle of the altar, he made a bronze grating, in the form of a network, extending from the top down to its halfway point.

(Exodus 37:33) 
He cast four bronze rings and attached them to the four upper corners of the grating, so that poles could be inserted into them.

(Exodus 37:34) 
He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.

(Exodus 37:35) 
He also made all the various utensils for the altar, for every ritual use: basins, meat hooks, shovels, tongs, and firepans—all made of bronze.

(Exodus 37:36) 
He made a bronze base, which was placed near the altar. It had a bronze grating on top, like a network, reaching up to the middle of the altar.

(Exodus 37:37) 
He cast four bronze rings and attached them to its four upper corners for inserting the carrying poles.

(Exodus 37:38) 
He also made bronze carrying poles and overlaid them with bronze.

(Exodus 37:39) 
He made all the vessels for the Dwelling (Tabernacle), along with all its other implements, including the curtains and their bases.

(Exodus 37:40) 
And he made all the vessels of the Dwelling, for all its prescribed rituals.

(Exodus 38:1) 
He also made the altar for burnt offerings out of acacia wood. It was five cubits long and five cubits wide, making it square, and it stood three cubits high.

(Exodus 38:2) 
He made its horns to extend directly from each of its four corners. And he covered the entire altar with bronze plates.

(Exodus 38:3) 
And he made all the various utensils for the altar's use: pans for gathering ashes, shovels, flesh hooks (three-pronged forks), hooks, and fire pans. All these objects were made entirely of bronze.

(Exodus 38:4) 
He also made for it a bronze grating, like a mesh, positioned below the altar's rim and extending halfway down its interior. At the four corners of this grating, he put four bronze rings through which carrying poles could be inserted.

(Exodus 38:5) 
He also made these carrying poles out of acacia wood and covered them with bronze plates.

(Exodus 38:6) 
The altar itself, which had four parts, was carried by these poles.

(Exodus 38:7) 
He also made the bronze laver with its bronze base from the mirrors of the women who ministered at the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Exodus 38:8) 
He also constructed the courtyard. On the south side, there were curtains made of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long, supported by twenty bronze pillars with their bronze bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.

(Exodus 38:9) 
On the north side, there were also curtains one hundred cubits long, with twenty bronze pillars and their bronze bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.

(Exodus 38:10) 
But on the west side, the curtains were fifty cubits long, with ten pillars and ten bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.

(Exodus 38:11) 
And on the east side, the curtains were fifty cubits long.

(Exodus 38:12) 
Ten cubits on one side and ten cubits on the other covered the entrance of the courtyard, with two pillars and two bases on each side of the entrance.

(Exodus 38:13) 
On the parts of the courtyard that stretched along each side of the main entrance, the curtains were fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

(Exodus 38:14) 
All the curtains of the courtyard were made of fine twisted linen.

(Exodus 38:15) 
The bases of the pillars were bronze, and their capitals and connecting hooks were silver. The pillars themselves were covered with silver plating.

(Exodus 38:16) 
And for the entrance of the courtyard, there was a curtain made of embroidered work, woven with blue, purple, scarlet yarns, and fine twisted linen. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, corresponding in all respects to the height of the courtyard curtains.

(Exodus 38:17) 
For this entrance curtain, there were four bronze bases and four silver capitals, fitted with silver connecting hooks, and the pillars themselves were covered with silver plating.

(Exodus 38:18) 
All the pegs for the Tabernacle and for the courtyard all around were made of bronze.

(Exodus 38:19) 
The total amount of gold, silver, and bronze offered for the work of the sanctuary was recorded by these weights.

(Exodus 38:20) 
The weights of the gold, silver, and bronze offered were tallied according to the count of those who had consulted Moses. Each individual's contribution was registered for the service of the Levites, under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

(Exodus 38:21) 
These are the items for the Tabernacle of the Testimony —where the covenant documents were kept— which were tallied by Moses, for the service of the Levites, under the direct supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

(Exodus 38:22) 
Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, was the master craftsman and architect. He carved, sculpted, and brought forth all that could be conceived.

(Exodus 38:23) 
And with him was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an excellent craftsman and embroiderer in blue, purple, double-dyed scarlet yarn, and fine linen.

(Exodus 38:24) 
All the gold that was used for the work of the sanctuary, including what was contributed by each individual, amounted to twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.

(Exodus 38:25) 
The silver offered by those who were registered among the people amounted to one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.

(Exodus 38:26) 
This was collected from each head of a household, twenty years old and above, from the six hundred three thousand five hundred men. Each man paid half a shekel, which is an obol according to the sacred weight of the sanctuary.

(Exodus 38:27) 
Thus, there were one hundred talents of silver. From this silver, the bases for the sanctuary and the bases for the veil were cast: one hundred bases from one hundred talents, with one talent used for each base.

(Exodus 38:28) 
And from the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, he made the connecting hooks for the pillars, covered the pillar capitals with silver plating, and joined them with rings.

(Exodus 38:29) 
The bronze offered amounted to seventy-two talents and four hundred shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.

(Exodus 38:30) 
From this bronze, he made the bases for the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the bronze altar, its bronze grating, and all its utensils.

(Exodus 38:31) 
It was also used for the bases of the courtyard all around, and for its curtain at the entrance, and for all the pegs of the Tabernacle, and all the pegs for the courtyard all around.

(Exodus 39:1) 
Therefore, from the violet, double-dyed purple, and scarlet threads, they made the garments that the priests were to wear when they ministered in the holy places and rituals, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:2) 
So they made the ephod from gold, violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen.

(Exodus 39:3) 
They cut golden plates and hammered them into fine threads, so they could be twisted together with the other threads: the violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet, and very fine linen, all crafted with embroidered work.

(Exodus 39:4) 
They made two shoulder pieces for it, which were connected on each side at the joining points.

(Exodus 39:5) 
Its woven waistband was made of the very same materials, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:6) 
They also prepared two onyx stones, set in gold filigree, and engraved them with the names of the sons of Israel, using the art of a gem cutter.

(Exodus 39:7) 
They placed these stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as a memorial for the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:8) 
They also made the breastplate with embroidered work, similar to the work of the ephod, from gold, violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and twisted fine linen.

(Exodus 39:9) 
It was square and doubled over, measuring one palm's length on each side.

(Exodus 39:10) 
They set four rows of precious stones in it. The first row had a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald.

(Exodus 39:11) 
The second row had a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.

(Exodus 39:12) 
The third row had a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.

(Exodus 39:13) 
The fourth row had a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl. All these stones were set in gold filigree and perfectly joined together.

(Exodus 39:14) 
There were twelve stones, corresponding to the twelve names of Israel, each engraved with a single name by the art of a sculptor and gem cutter.

(Exodus 39:15) 
They made chains for the breastplate, linked to each other, out of pure gold.

(Exodus 39:16) 
They also made two gold clasps and two gold rings, which could be joined to the breastplate on both sides.

(Exodus 39:17) 
Through these rings, they inserted the two gold chains and attached them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.

(Exodus 39:18) 
They also made two gold borders and two gold rings, and placed these rings on each side of the breastplate.

(Exodus 39:19) 
And two other gold rings they fastened on the two lower edges of the ephod, on the inside, near where it was joined.

(Exodus 39:20) 
This was so the breastplate could be fastened and secured by the rings and chains joining it.

(Exodus 39:21) 
And the breastplate was bound by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so it could not become separated from the woven material it was joined to, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:22) 
They also made the robe of the ephod entirely of violet thread.

(Exodus 39:23) 
And there was an opening in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail, so it could be put on, and its opening was reinforced with woven work all around.

(Exodus 39:24) 
And at the bottom, all around the hem of this robe, they made decorations resembling pomegranates, using violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and twisted fine linen.

(Exodus 39:25) 
They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates, all around the hem of the robe.

(Exodus 39:26) 
So there was a bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the hem, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:27) 
They also made tunics of fine linen, woven work, for Moses and his sons.

(Exodus 39:28) 
And turbans of fine linen, and elegant linen caps, and linen breeches of fine linen.

(Exodus 39:29) 
They also made a sash of twisted fine linen, and violet, double-dyed purple, and scarlet thread, all with embroidered work, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:30) 
They also made the plate for the holy consecration, from pure gold, and engraved on it, with the work of a sculptor: 'Holy to the Lord.'

(Exodus 39:31) 
They fastened it to the top of the turban with a violet cord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:32) 
So all the work of the Tabernacle and the Tent of the Covenant was completed. The sons of Israel did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 39:33) 
And they brought the Tabernacle to Moses, along with the tent covering, and all its furnishings: the clasps, the planks, the bars, the pillars, and the bases.

(Exodus 39:34) 
They brought the covering of ram skins dyed red, and the other outer covering made of violet-dyed animal skins.

(Exodus 39:35) 
They brought the mercy seat, the table with all its utensils, the lampstand with its lamps, and all its accessories.

(Exodus 39:36) 
They brought the golden altars, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the veil for the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Exodus 39:37) 
They brought the bronze altar, its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, along with the laver and its base.

(Exodus 39:38) 
They brought the hangings for the courtyard, and its pillars, its bases, and the veil for the gate of the courtyard, its cords, and its pegs, and all the utensils for the service of the Tabernacle and the Tent of the Covenant.

(Exodus 39:39) 
They brought the garments that the priests wore when they ministered in the holy places and rituals.

(Exodus 39:40) 
Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so all the sons of Israel did everything.

(Exodus 40:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Moses and said:

(Exodus 40:2) 
On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the tent for the Ark of the Covenant, which bears witness to My covenant with Israel.

(Exodus 40:3) 
Inside the tent, you shall place the Ark of the Covenant. Then you shall shield it with a veil.

(Exodus 40:4) 
You shall bring in the table of the bread of the presence, and in proper order, you will arrange everything that belongs on it. You will then set up the lampstand with its lamps.

(Exodus 40:5) 
You shall place the golden altar for incense offerings in front of the Ark of the Covenant. And you shall hang the curtain at the entrance of the tent.

(Exodus 40:6) 
And in front of that altar, you shall place the altar for burnt offerings.

(Exodus 40:7) 
You shall place the basin for washing between the altar and the tent, filling it with water.

(Exodus 40:8) 
You shall then enclose the courtyard with its curtains and hang the curtain at the entrance of the entire courtyard.

(Exodus 40:9) 
Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tent with all of its furnishings and vessels so that they may be set apart as holy to God.

(Exodus 40:10) 
You shall also consecrate the altar for burnt offerings and all its vessels by anointing them.

(Exodus 40:11) 
You shall anoint the washing basin with its stand, and you shall set them apart as holy.

(Exodus 40:12) 
You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of the Ark of the Covenant. And when you have washed them with water,

(Exodus 40:13) 
you shall dress Aaron in the holy garments. You shall anoint him and set him apart as holy to serve Me as a priest.

(Exodus 40:14) 
You shall also bring his sons and dress them in tunics.

(Exodus 40:15) 
You shall anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may serve Me as priests. And this anointing shall be for them a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.

(Exodus 40:16) 
And Moses did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded him.

(Exodus 40:17) 
So, in the first month of the second year, on the first day of that month, the tent for the Ark of the Covenant was set up.

(Exodus 40:18) 
Moses set up the tent, placed its planks, its bases, its crossbars, and its pillars.

(Exodus 40:19) 
He spread the covering over the tent and placed the outer covering on top of it, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Exodus 40:20) 
He then took the tablets of the covenant and placed them inside the Ark. He placed the atonement cover on top of the Ark, and he brought the Ark into the tent.

(Exodus 40:21) 
And he hung the veil in front of it, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Exodus 40:22) 
He also placed the table in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, on the north side, outside the veil.

(Exodus 40:23) 
And he properly arranged the bread of the presence on it before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 40:24) 
He also placed the lampstand in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, opposite the table, on the south side.

(Exodus 40:25) 
He arranged the lamps in their proper order according to the Lord's command.

(Exodus 40:26) 
He also placed the golden altar for incense in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, in front of the veil.

(Exodus 40:27) 
He burned fragrant incense on it, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 40:28) 
And he hung the curtain at the entrance of the tent.

(Exodus 40:29) 
He placed the altar for burnt offerings at the entrance of the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, and he offered burnt offerings and other sacrifices on it, just as the Lord had commanded.

(Exodus 40:30) 
And he set the washing basin between the tent of the Ark of the Covenant and the altar, filling it with water.

(Exodus 40:31) 
In it, Moses and Aaron, along with his sons, washed their hands and their feet.

(Exodus 40:32) 
They would wash whenever they entered the tent of the covenant and whenever they approached the altar, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Exodus 40:33) 
He also erected the courtyard around the tent and the altar, setting up the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard. After everything was completed,

(Exodus 40:34) 
a cloud covered the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, and the glory of the Lord filled it completely.

(Exodus 40:35) 
And Moses was unable to enter the tent of the covenant because the cloud had covered it, and the majesty of the Lord shone brightly within it.

(Exodus 40:36) 
Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, the children of Israel would travel, moving forward in their groups.

(Exodus 40:37) 
If the cloud remained above, they would stay in the same place.

(Exodus 40:38) 
For the Lord's cloud rested upon the tent by day, and a fire was in it by night. All of Israel could see this, throughout all their journeys and encampments.
