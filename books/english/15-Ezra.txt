(Ezra 1:1) 
In the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, so that the prophecy of the Lord, spoken through Jeremiah, would be fulfilled, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, even by written decree, saying:

(Ezra 1:2) 
This is what Cyrus, the king of Persia, says: 'The Lord, the God of the universe, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He Himself has commanded me to build Him a Temple in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.'

(Ezra 1:3) 
'Who among you is of all His people? May his God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the Temple of the Lord, the God of Israel—for He is the God whose presence is in Jerusalem.'

(Ezra 1:4) 
'And all the others, in every place where they dwell, let the men from their own places help those returning to Jerusalem with silver and with gold, and with goods, and with livestock, besides the voluntary offerings they give for the Temple of God which is in Jerusalem.'

(Ezra 1:5) 
Then the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin arose, as did the priests and the Levites, and everyone whose spirit God had moved, to go up and build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 1:6) 
And all those who were around them helped them with silver and gold articles, with goods, and with livestock, and with valuable things, besides what they offered willingly.

(Ezra 1:7) 
King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the Temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his own god.

(Ezra 1:8) 
These King Cyrus of Persia brought out through the hand of Mithridates, the son of Gazabar, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.

(Ezra 1:9) 
And this is their number: thirty gold basins, one thousand and one silver basins, twenty-nine knives,

(Ezra 1:10) 
thirty gold cups, four hundred and ten secondary-grade silver cups, and one thousand other articles.

(Ezra 1:11) 
All the gold and silver articles totaled five thousand four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these out with those who were going up from the exile, from Babylon to Jerusalem.

(Ezra 1:12) 
Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.

(Ezra 1:13) 
Those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

(Ezra 1:14) 
the children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.

(Ezra 1:15)

The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.

(Ezra 1:39) 
The men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred twenty-three.

(Ezra 1:40) 
The children of Nebo, fifty-two.

(Ezra 2:1) 
These are the people from the province of Judah who came back from exile. They were the ones who had been taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and brought to Babylon. Now they returned to Jerusalem and the land of Judah, each person going to their own city.

(Ezra 2:2) 
They returned with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. This is the total number of men of the people of Israel:

(Ezra 2:3)

(Ezra 2:34)

(Ezra 2:38) 
The descendants of Pashhur numbered one thousand two hundred forty-seven.

(Ezra 2:39) 
The descendants of Harim numbered one thousand seventeen.

(Ezra 2:40) 
Among the Levites, the descendants of Jeshua and Kadmiel, from the line of Hodaviah, numbered seventy-four.

(Ezra 3:1) 
The seventh month of the year had arrived—the time for the Feast of Tabernacles—and the Israelites were dwelling in their towns, but the people gathered together as one unified group in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 3:2) 
Then Joshua, son of Jehozadak, rose up with his brother priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, with his brothers. They built an altar to the God of Israel so that they could offer burnt offerings on it, just as it is written in the Law given to Moses, the man of God.

(Ezra 3:3) 
They set the altar on its proper foundations, even though they were afraid of the local peoples in the surrounding lands. Then they offered burnt offerings upon it to the Lord, both in the morning and in the evening.

(Ezra 3:4) 
They then celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, just as it is written in the Law. They offered the required number of burnt offerings each day, following the prescribed ceremony, ensuring that the work for each day was completed on its proper day.

(Ezra 3:5) 
After this, they offered the regular daily burnt offering, as well as those for the new moons, and for all the Lord's consecrated feast days. They also offered sacrifices for everyone who willingly offered sacrifices to the Lord.

(Ezra 3:6) 
From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, even though the foundation for the Lord's Temple had not yet been laid.

(Ezra 3:7) 
They gave money to the stonemasons and carpenters for their work. They also provided food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians so that they would transport cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa. This was all done according to the command that had been given by Cyrus, the king of Persia.

(Ezra 3:8) 
In the second year of their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, specifically in the second month, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, son of Jehozadak, along with their fellow priests and Levites and all the others who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem, began the work. They appointed Levites who were twenty years of age or older to oversee the construction work for the Lord's Temple.

(Ezra 3:9) 
Joshua, his sons, and his brothers stood together with Kadmiel and his sons, and the sons of Judah, as one unified group, to supervise those who were working on the Temple of God. This supervisory group also included the sons of Henadad with their sons, and their brothers the Levites.

(Ezra 3:10) 
When the masons had laid the foundation of the Lord's Temple, the priests stood dressed in their sacred robes, holding trumpets. The Levites, who were descendants of Asaph, stood with cymbals. They were there to praise God, following the musical instructions and arrangements that had been established by David, king of Israel.

(Ezra 3:11) 
They sang responsively in hymns and gave thanks to the Lord, singing: "For He is good, for His mercy endures forever over Israel." All the people then shouted with a great and loud cheer, praising the Lord because the foundation of the Lord's Temple had finally been laid.

(Ezra 3:12) 
Many of the priests, Levites, and the older heads of families who had seen the glory of the first Temple, upon seeing the foundations of this new, first Temple, wept with a loud cry of sorrow and remembrance. At the same time, many others shouted for joy, raising their voices in celebration.

(Ezra 3:13) 
And so, no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of the people weeping, because the crowds were shouting and crying out with such great loudness that the sound was heard from far away.

(Ezra 4:1) 
But the enemies of the people of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returning exiles were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Ezra 4:2) 
These enemies approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families, saying, 'Let us build with you, because we also seek your God, just as you do. We have been offering sacrifices to him—the God of Israel—since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, who brought us here to this land.'

(Ezra 4:3) 
But Zerubbabel and Joshua, along with the rest of the heads of the families of Israel, said to them, 'You have no part with us in building a house for our God. We alone will build for the Lord, the God of Israel, just as Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.'

(Ezra 4:4) 
Therefore, the local inhabitants of the land began to discourage the people of Judah and frustrate their efforts in building.

(Ezra 4:5) 
They even hired counselors to work against the people of Judah, to thwart their plans during all the days that Cyrus was king of Persia and even until the reign of Darius, the next king of Persia.

(Ezra 4:6) 
Now, in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the very beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

(Ezra 4:7) 
And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia. The accusation was written in the Aramaic language, and it was read aloud.

(Ezra 4:8) 
Rehum, the commander, and Shimshai, the scribe, wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in the following manner:

(Ezra 4:9) 
From Rehum, the commander, and Shimshai, the scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges, the officials from Apharsath, the people from Tarphel, the people from Aphars, the people from Erech, the Babylonians, the people from Susa, the people from Deha, and the Elamites—

(Ezra 4:10) 
And the rest of the nations whom Osnappar—the great and glorious official—had carried away and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the other regions beyond the Euphrates River, and so forth, greeting.

(Ezra 4:11) 
This is a copy of the letter they sent to King Artaxerxes: 'Your servants, the men who are beyond the Euphrates River, send greetings.'

(Ezra 4:12) 
'Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from your presence to us have arrived in Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city. They are rebuilding it, raising its walls, and repairing its structures.'

(Ezra 4:13) 
'Therefore, let it now be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, they will not pay tribute, customs, or tolls. This will be harmful to all the kings who rule over these lands.'

(Ezra 4:14) 
'Now, because we are mindful of our duty to the palace—remembering the salt we have eaten in the king's service—and because it is not fitting to allow disrespect to the king, we have therefore sent this message to inform the king.'

(Ezra 4:15) 
'We suggest that a search be made in the historical records of your predecessors. You will find it written in the chronicles, and you will learn that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and it was for this very reason that it was laid waste in the past.'

(Ezra 4:16) 
'We also inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, then you will no longer have any claim or possession in the region beyond the Euphrates River.'

(Ezra 4:17) 
Then the king sent his reply to Rehum, the commander, to Shimshai, the scribe, and to the rest of their associates who lived in Samaria and in the other regions beyond the Euphrates River, saying, 'Greetings and peace!'

(Ezra 4:18) 
'The letter that you sent to us has been plainly read in my presence.'

(Ezra 4:19) 
'I then issued a command, and a search was conducted. It was found that this city has indeed been rebellious against kings since ancient times, and sedition and rebellion have occurred within it.'

(Ezra 4:20) 
'For even mighty kings have reigned in Jerusalem who ruled over all the region beyond the Euphrates River, and they also collected tribute, customs, and tolls from others.'

(Ezra 4:21) 
'Therefore, now issue an order to stop these men. This city is not to be rebuilt until I give a further command.'

(Ezra 4:22) 
'See to it that you do not neglect this matter. Why should evil continue to grow, to the detriment and harm of the kings?'

(Ezra 4:23) 
So, when the copy of King Artaxerxes' decree was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they quickly went to Jerusalem to the Jews. They stopped them by force and with military power.

(Ezra 4:24) 
Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem was stopped. It remained unfinished until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.

(Ezra 5:1) 
Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, proclaimed God's message to the Jews who were living in Judah and Jerusalem, doing so in the name of the God of Israel.

(Ezra 5:2) 
Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, helping them in their work.

(Ezra 5:3) 
At that same time, Tattenai, who was the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates River, along with Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, came to them. They questioned the builders, asking, “Who gave you the authority to construct this House of God and to complete these walls?”

(Ezra 5:4) 
We answered them by stating the names of the men who were building that House of God.

(Ezra 5:5) 
However, the eyes of their God were upon the elders of the Jews, and the officials could not stop them until the matter was reported to King Darius and a decision on this issue was received.

(Ezra 5:6) 
This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates River, along with Shethar-Bozenai and his associates, the Apharsachites, who were also from beyond the River, sent to King Darius.

(Ezra 5:7) 
The message they sent to him was as follows: “To King Darius: May you have complete peace and prosperity.

(Ezra 5:8) 
Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the House of the Great God, which is being built with large stones, and timber is being laid in its walls. This work is being carried out diligently, and it is progressing well in their hands.

(Ezra 5:9) 
And we questioned those elders, asking, ‘Who gave you the authority to build this House of God and to complete these walls?’

(Ezra 5:10) 
We also asked them for their names so that we could report back to you and write down the names of the men who are their leaders.

(Ezra 5:11) 
But they gave us this response, saying: ‘We are servants of the God of Heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple which was built many years ago, and which a great king of Israel had built and established.’

(Ezra 5:12) 
‘However, because our fathers provoked the God of Heaven to anger, He delivered them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean. And that king destroyed this House of God and carried its people away to Babylon.

(Ezra 5:13) 
‘Nevertheless, in the first year of Cyrus, the King of Babylon, King Cyrus himself issued an order for this House of God to be rebuilt.

(Ezra 5:14) 
‘Indeed, even the gold and silver vessels of the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and carried off to the temple in Babylon, King Cyrus brought out from the temple in Babylon. They were handed over to a man named Sheshbazzar, who was a prince.

(Ezra 5:15) 
‘And Cyrus said to him: “Take these vessels, go, and place them in the Temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the House of God be rebuilt on its original site.”

(Ezra 5:16) 
‘Then, therefore, this same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time until now, it has been under construction, but it is not yet finished.

(Ezra 5:17) 
‘And now, if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives, which are in Babylon, to determine whether it was indeed decreed by King Cyrus that this House of God in Jerusalem should be rebuilt. And let the king's will concerning this matter be sent to us.’

(Ezra 6:1) 
Then King Darius sent letters, and an investigation was made in the royal library of books, where he had stored the royal treasures.

(Ezra 6:2) 
And a single scroll was found in Ecbatana, which is a fortress city in the region of Media. This is what was written on it:

(Ezra 6:3) 
In the first year of King Cyrus’s reign, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the House of God which is in Jerusalem: “Let a temple be built, a place where burnt offerings may be sacrificed. Let its foundation be laid solid: its height should be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits.

(Ezra 6:4) 
Let there be three courses of undressed stones and one course of new timbers. And the expenses for this shall be paid from the king’s treasury.

(Ezra 6:5) 
Furthermore, let the gold and silver vessels of the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple of Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned. Let them be carried back to the Temple in Jerusalem to their proper place, and be set up in the House of God.”

(Ezra 6:6) 
“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials of the region beyond the River—keep yourselves far away from them.

(Ezra 6:7) 
Allow the work on that House of God to proceed, so that they may rebuild that Temple in its proper place, and let the elders of the Jews build the House of God.

(Ezra 6:8) 
Furthermore, I have decreed what is to be done for the elders of the Jews, so that they may build this House of God. That is to say, from the king’s treasury—from the taxes that are collected from the region beyond the River—expenses are to be diligently given to those men, so that the work may not cease.

(Ezra 6:9) 
And if anything else is needed, whether bulls, rams, or lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of the sky, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil according to the ritual of the priests of Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day, so that there may be no delay or offense in anything.

(Ezra 6:10) 
So that they may offer sacrifices to the God of the sky, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.

(Ezra 6:11) 
Therefore, I have issued this decree: if any person alters this command, let a timber be taken from his house, and let him be impaled upon it, and let his house be confiscated by the state.

(Ezra 6:12) 
And may the God who has made His Name dwell there overthrow every kingdom and people who stretches out their hand to attack and destroy that House of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, and it must be diligently carried out.

(Ezra 6:13) 
So then, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues, diligently carried out what King Darius had commanded.

(Ezra 6:14) 
Meanwhile, the elders of the Jews were building and making good progress, in accordance with the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They built and completed it according to the command of the God of Israel, and according to the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.

(Ezra 6:15) 
And this House of God was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.

(Ezra 6:16) 
Then the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, along with the rest of the returning exiles, joyfully celebrated the dedication of the House of God.

(Ezra 6:17) 
For the dedication of the House of God, they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all of Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.

(Ezra 6:18) 
And they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their courses of service for the work of God in Jerusalem, just as it is written in the Book of Moses.

(Ezra 6:19) 
The returning exiles of Israel also celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

(Ezra 6:20) 
For the priests and Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean and ready to sacrifice the Passover lamb for all the returning exiles, and for their own brothers, the priests, and for themselves.

(Ezra 6:21) 
And the children of Israel who had returned from exile ate the Passover meal, along with everyone who had separated themselves from the impurities of the peoples of the land to join them in seeking the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Ezra 6:22) 
And they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy for seven days, because the Lord had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, thus helping them in the work on the House of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Ezra 7:1) 
After these historical events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, Ezra appeared. He was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah,

(Ezra 7:2) 
who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub,

(Ezra 7:3) 
who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth,

(Ezra 7:4) 
who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Bukki, who was the son of Abishua,

(Ezra 7:5) 
who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron, the chief priest.

(Ezra 7:6) 
This same Ezra came up from Babylon. He was an expert scribe in the Law of Moses, the Law which the Lord God of Israel had given. The king granted him every request he made, because the favor of the Lord his God was upon him.

(Ezra 7:7) 
Some of the children of Israel also traveled up to Jerusalem with him, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes’ reign.

(Ezra 7:8) 
Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was still in the seventh year of the king’s reign.

(Ezra 7:9) 
Because on the first day of the first month, he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month, he arrived in Jerusalem, protected by the good favor of his God upon him.

(Ezra 7:10) 
For Ezra had committed himself fully to studying the Law of the Lord, to practicing it himself, and to teaching its statutes and ordinances to the people of Israel.

(Ezra 7:11) 
Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest and scribe, who was expert in the words of the Lord’s commandments and His ritual practices in Israel.

(Ezra 7:12) 
Artaxerxes, the king of all kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the divine Law of God, sends greetings of peace.

(Ezra 7:13) 
I have now issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel, including their priests and Levites, who freely chooses to go to Jerusalem, is permitted to go with you.

(Ezra 7:14) 
For you are sent from the king and his seven royal advisors to conduct an inspection of Judea and Jerusalem, in accordance with the Law of your God, which you possess.

(Ezra 7:15) 
You are also to carry the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:16) 
And you are to bring all the silver and gold that you have gathered throughout the entire province of Babylon, along with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, which they have freely offered to the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:17) 
With this money, you are diligently to purchase bulls, rams, and lambs, along with their accompanying grain offerings and drink offerings, and then offer them upon the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:18) 
If you and your kinsmen decide to do anything further with the remaining silver and gold, you may do so, according to the will of your God.

(Ezra 7:19) 
You are also to deliver all the vessels that have been entrusted to you for the service of the Temple of your God, placing them before God in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:20) 
Whatever else may be needed for the Temple of your God, and is provided to you, you shall furnish from the royal treasury and coffers.

(Ezra 7:21) 
I, King Artaxerxes, have also issued a decree and a command to all the administrators of the treasury in the province Beyond the River: whatever Ezra, the priest and scribe of the divine Law of God, requests from you, must be given to him without delay.

(Ezra 7:22) 
This includes up to one hundred talents of silver, up to one hundred kors of salt, up to one hundred baths of wine, up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt in any quantity needed.

(Ezra 7:23) 
Whatever is required for the ritual practices of the Temple of the divine God, let it be given diligently from the king’s treasury, so that divine wrath may not fall upon the king and his children.

(Ezra 7:24) 
We also make it known to you that regarding all the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and other servants of this Temple of God, you are not to impose any taxes, tribute, or customs duties upon them.

(Ezra 7:25) 
And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God, which is within you, are to appoint magistrates and judges who will administer justice to all the people in the province Beyond the River—that is, to all who know the Law of your God. You are also to instruct those who do not know it.

(Ezra 7:26) 
Whoever fails to obey the Law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him swiftly: whether by death, or by banishment, or by forfeiture of goods, or by imprisonment.

(Ezra 7:27) 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers, who put it into the heart of the king to beautify the Temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:28) 
And He has shown me favor before the king, his advisors, and all the king’s powerful officials. So, because the hand of the Lord my God was upon me and strengthened me, I gathered leaders from Israel to travel up with me.

(Ezra 7:1) 
After these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, Ezra, who was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,

(Ezra 7:2) 
who was the son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,

(Ezra 7:3) 
who was the son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,

(Ezra 7:4) 
who was the son of Zerahiah, son of Bocci, son of Abishua,

(Ezra 7:5) 
who was the son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, who was the very first priest.

(Ezra 7:6) 
This same Ezra came up from Babylon, and he was a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses—the very law that the Lord, the God of Israel, had given. And the king, because God was with Ezra, granted him every request that he made.

(Ezra 7:7) 
Some of the children of Israel came up with him, as well as some of the children of the priests, and some of the children of the Levites. Also, some of the singers, some of the gatekeepers, and some of the Nathinim—the temple servants—came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes' reign.

(Ezra 7:8) 
Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month; this was still the seventh year of the king's reign.

(Ezra 7:9) 
For on the first day of the first month, he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month, he arrived in Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was with him and guided him.

(Ezra 7:10) 
Ezra had fully committed his heart to studying the Law of the Lord, to carrying it out, and to teaching God's decrees and judgments in Israel.

(Ezra 7:11) 
This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest, who was a scribe well-versed in the words and decrees of the Lord, and in His rituals for Israel.

(Ezra 7:12) 
Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra, the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of the universe—greetings.

(Ezra 7:13) 
I have issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel, and from their priests, and from their Levites, who willingly desires to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.

(Ezra 7:14) 
For you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inspect Judea and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.

(Ezra 7:15) 
And you are to carry silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have willingly offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling place is in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:16) 
Also, you are to bring all the silver and gold that you collect throughout the entire province of Babylon, along with whatever the people and the priests willingly offer as gifts for the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:17) 
You are to carefully use this money to buy bulls, rams, and lambs, as well as their grain offerings and their drink offerings. Then you shall offer them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:18) 
Furthermore, if you and your brothers decide to do anything else with the remaining silver and gold, you may do so according to the will of your God.

(Ezra 7:19) 
The vessels that have been given to you for the service of the house of your God, you are to present them before God in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 7:20) 
Whatever else you and your brothers need for the house of your God and its uses, you are to provide it from the royal treasury and the king's taxes.

(Ezra 7:21) 
And I, Artaxerxes, the king, have issued a standing order and decree to all the treasurers in the region Beyond the River: whatever Ezra, the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of the universe, requests from you, it is to be provided without delay.

(Ezra 7:22) 
up to one hundred talents of silver, up to one hundred cors of wheat, up to one hundred baths of wine, up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without any limit.

(Ezra 7:23) 
Whatever pertains to the ritual of the God of the universe, let it be carefully supplied from the treasury of the God of the universe, so that His wrath may not come upon my kingdom and upon my sons.

(Ezra 7:24) 
We also make known to you concerning all the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nathinim—the temple servants—and other ministers of this house of God: you are not to impose tribute, or customs, or taxes on them.

(Ezra 7:25) 
And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is within your power, are to appoint judges and magistrates to govern all the people who are in the region Beyond the River. You are to appoint those who know the Law of your God, and you are also to teach those who do not know it.

(Ezra 7:26) 
And whoever does not obey the Law of your God and the law of the king, judgment is to be carried out against him—whether by death, by exile, by confiscation of property, or certainly by imprisonment.

(Ezra 7:27) 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers, who put such a desire into the heart of the king to glorify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,

(Ezra 7:28) 
and who extended His mercy towards me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's powerful princes. And I, being strengthened by the hand of the Lord my God, gathered leading men from Israel to come up with me.

(Ezra 8:1) 
So, these are the heads of the ancestral families, and this is the official record of their lineage, all of whom returned to Jerusalem with me from Babylon, during the reign of King Artaxerxes.

(Ezra 8:2) 
From the descendants of Phinehas was Gershom. From the descendants of Ithamar was Daniel. From the descendants of David was Hattush.

(Ezra 8:3) 
From the descendants of Shecaniah, and from the descendants of Parosh, was Zechariah; and with him were counted one hundred and fifty men.

(Ezra 8:4) 
From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Eliehoenai, the son of Zerahiah; and with him were two hundred men.

(Ezra 8:5) 
From the descendants of Zattu: Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel; and with him were three hundred men.

(Ezra 8:6) 
From the descendants of Adin: Ebed, the son of Jonathan; and with him were fifty men.

(Ezra 8:7) 
From the descendants of Elam: Isaiah, the son of Athaliah; and with him were seventy men.

(Ezra 8:8) 
From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah, the son of Michael; and with him were eighty men.

(Ezra 8:9) 
From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah, the son of Jehiel; and with him were two hundred and eighteen men.

(Ezra 8:10) 
From the descendants of Bani: Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him were one hundred and sixty men.

(Ezra 8:11) 
From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah, the son of Bebai; and with him were twenty-eight men.

(Ezra 8:12) 
From the descendants of Azgad: Johanan, the son of Hakkatan; and with him were one hundred and ten men.

(Ezra 8:13) 
From the descendants of Adonikam, who were the very last to arrive: and these are their names, Eliphelet, Jehiel, and Shemaiah; and with them were sixty men.

(Ezra 8:14) 
From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai and Zabbud; and with them were seventy men.

(Ezra 8:15) 
Now, I assembled them near the river that flows towards Ahava, and we stayed there for three days. I examined the people and the priests for descendants of Levi, and I did not find any there.

(Ezra 8:16) 
Therefore, I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Shemaiah, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders. I also sent Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise men.

(Ezra 8:17) 
And I sent them to Iddo, who was the chief man in the place called Casiphia. I put words in their mouths, instructing them what to say to Iddo and his Nethinim brothers in Casiphia, so that they would bring us ministers for the house of our God.

(Ezra 8:18) 
And they brought us, by the good hand of our God upon us, a very learned man from the descendants of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel: namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his eighteen brothers.

(Ezra 8:19) 
They also brought Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their twenty sons.

(Ezra 8:20) 
And from the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, they brought two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All these were designated by name.

(Ezra 8:21) 
And there, beside the Ahava River, I proclaimed a fast so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions.

(Ezra 8:22) 
For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the journey. This was because we had told the king: 'The hand of our God is upon all those who seek Him for good, but His power, strength, and anger are against all who abandon Him.'

(Ezra 8:23) 
So we fasted and pleaded with our God for this, and He was gracious to us.

(Ezra 8:24) 
Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them.

(Ezra 8:25) 
And I weighed out to them the silver, gold, and the consecrated vessels for the house of our God, which the king, his counselors, his officials, and all of Israel who were present had offered.

(Ezra 8:26) 
I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred silver vessels, and one hundred talents of gold.

(Ezra 8:27) 
Also, twenty gold bowls, which were worth a thousand gold coins, and two excellent vessels of shining bronze, as beautiful as gold.

(Ezra 8:28) 
And I said to them: 'You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy. This silver and gold has been willingly offered to the Lord, the God of our ancestors.

(Ezra 8:29) 
Watch over them and guard them until you weigh them out in Jerusalem before the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel, in the treasury of the Lord's house.'

(Ezra 8:30) 
So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, gold, and vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.

(Ezra 8:31) 
So we set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush on the way.

(Ezra 8:32) 
And we arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.

(Ezra 8:33) 
On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar, son of Phinehas. Also present were the Levites Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui.

(Ezra 8:34) 
We carefully counted and weighed everything, and the weight of each individual item was recorded in writing. The total sum was immediately documented.

(Ezra 8:35) 
The people who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all of them as a burnt offering to the Lord.

(Ezra 8:36) 
They also delivered the king's edicts to the satraps who were under the king's authority and to the governors beyond the River Euphrates. And these officials then gave their support to the people and to the house of God.

(Ezra 8:37) 
And after these events, the leaders approached me, saying: 'The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the peoples of these lands and from their abominations. This includes the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.'

(Ezra 8:38) 
'For they have taken wives from the daughters of these peoples for themselves and for their sons, and they have mixed the holy seed—the chosen people of God—with the peoples of these lands. Indeed, the hands of the leaders and officials have been foremost in this transgression.'

(Ezra 8:39) 
When I heard this report, I tore my garments and my cloak, and I pulled out hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down in utter grief and despair.

(Ezra 8:40) 
And all those who feared the word of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the transgression of those who had returned from captivity. And I remained sitting in sorrow until the time of the evening sacrifice.

(Ezra 8:1) 
These are the heads of the ancestral families, and this is the list of their descendants, who ascended with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes.

(Ezra 8:2) 
From the descendants of Phinehas, there was Gershom; from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; from the descendants of David, Hattush.

(Ezra 8:3) 
From the descendants of Shechaniah, and from the descendants of Parosh, there was Zechariah, and with him were counted one hundred and fifty men.

(Ezra 8:4) 
From the descendants of Pahath-Moab, there was Eliehoenai, son of Zerahiah, and with him were two hundred men.

(Ezra 8:5) 
From the descendants of Shechaniah, there was the son of Jahaziel, and with him were three hundred men.

(Ezra 8:6) 
From the descendants of Adin, there was Ebed, son of Jonathan, and with him were fifty men.

(Ezra 8:7) 
From the descendants of Elam, there was Isaiah, son of Athaliah, and with him were seventy men.

(Ezra 8:8) 
From the descendants of Shephatiah, there was Zebadiah, son of Michael, and with him were eighty men.

(Ezra 8:9) 
From the descendants of Joab, there was Obadiah, son of Jehiel, and with him were two hundred and eighteen men.

(Ezra 8:10) 
From the descendants of Bani, there was Shelomith, son of Josiphiah, and with him were one hundred and sixty men.

(Ezra 8:11) 
From the descendants of Bebai, there was Zechariah, son of Bebai, and with him were twenty-eight men.

(Ezra 8:12) 
From the descendants of Azgad, there was Johanan, son of Hakkatan, and with him were one hundred and ten men.

(Ezra 8:13) 
From the descendants of Adonikam, who were the last to arrive from that family, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jehiel, and Shemaiah, and with them were sixty men.

(Ezra 8:14) 
From the descendants of Bigvai, there were Uthai and Zabbud, and with them were seventy men.

(Ezra 8:15) 
I gathered them by the river that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there for three days. As I inspected the people and the priests, I found no one there from the descendants of Levi.

(Ezra 8:16) 
So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leading men. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise teachers.

(Ezra 8:17) 
I sent them to Iddo, who was the chief at a place called Casiphia. I gave them specific instructions about what to say to Iddo and his relatives, the Nethinim, who were living in Casiphia—all with the purpose of bringing us ministers for the house of our God.

(Ezra 8:18) 
And through the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a highly skilled man from the descendants of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel—that was Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, a total of eighteen men.

(Ezra 8:19) 
They also brought Hashabiah, and with him, from the descendants of Merari, Isaiah, along with his brothers and his sons, a total of twenty men.

(Ezra 8:20) 
And from the Nethinim, whom King David and the leaders had assigned to assist the Levites in their service, they brought two hundred and twenty Nethinim; all these were designated by name.

(Ezra 8:21) 
There, by the Ahava River, I proclaimed a fast for everyone. This was so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe and proper journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions.

(Ezra 8:22) 
I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from our enemies along the way. This was because we had already told the king, 'The hand of our God is good and protects all those who seek Him with sincerity, but His power, strength, and wrath are against all who abandon Him.'

(Ezra 8:23) 
So we fasted and sought help from our God through prayer for this very reason, and He was gracious to us.

(Ezra 8:24) 
Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers.

(Ezra 8:25) 
I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the sacred vessels intended for the house of our God—these were offerings that the king, his counselors, his officials, and all the Israelites present had contributed.

(Ezra 8:26) 
I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred silver vessels, and one hundred talents of gold.

(Ezra 8:27) 
Also, twenty gold bowls, which were worth a thousand gold darics (gold coins), and two vessels of fine, burnished bronze, which were as valuable as gold.

(Ezra 8:28) 
Then I said to them: 'You are consecrated to the Lord, and these vessels are sacred. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of our fathers.'

(Ezra 8:29) 
'Watch over them and guard them carefully until you weigh them out in Jerusalem, in the presence of the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of the Israelite families, and place them in the treasury of the house of the Lord.'

(Ezra 8:30) 
So the priests and the Levites received the exact weight of the silver, gold, and vessels, with the responsibility to transport them to Jerusalem for the house of our God.

(Ezra 8:31) 
Then, on the twelfth day of the first month—the month of Nisan—we departed from the Ahava River to journey to Jerusalem. The good hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the power of the enemy and from ambushers along the road.

(Ezra 8:32) 
We arrived in Jerusalem and rested there for three days.

(Ezra 8:33) 
On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed out in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar, son of Phinehas. The Levites present were Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui.

(Ezra 8:34) 
Everything was accounted for by number and by weight; and the entire weight was recorded at that time.

(Ezra 8:35) 
The exiles who had returned from captivity then offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all of these were presented as a whole burnt offering to the Lord.

(Ezra 8:36) 
They also delivered the king’s decrees to the satraps—the provincial governors—and to the officials of the regions beyond the Euphrates River. And these officials then assisted the people and the house of God.

(Ezra 9:1) 
After these things were completed, the leaders came to me, saying: 'The people of Israel, even the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples of the lands and their detestable practices--the very practices God had forbidden. These nations include the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.'

(Ezra 9:2) 
For they have taken wives from the daughters of these nations for themselves and for their sons, and they have mingled the holy lineage--the chosen people of God--with the surrounding peoples of the lands. The hands of the leaders and officials were the very first in this grave offense.

(Ezra 9:3) 
When I heard this report, I tore my garments and my cloak, and I pulled out some of the hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down in deep mourning.

(Ezra 9:4) 
Then all those who feared the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, gathered around me because of the transgression of those who had returned from the captivity. And I remained sitting in mourning until the evening sacrifice--the time of daily atonement.

(Ezra 9:5) 
At the hour of the evening sacrifice, I rose from my deep affliction, still in my torn garment and cloak. I knelt down and spread out my hands in prayer to the Lord, my God.

(Ezra 9:6) 
And I said: 'My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to You, because our iniquities have multiplied over our heads, and our transgressions have grown up to the very heavens--reaching throughout the universe.'

(Ezra 9:7) 
From the days of our ancestors until this very day, we have been in great transgression. Because of our iniquities, we ourselves, our kings, and our priests have been handed over into the hand of the kings of the surrounding lands--delivered to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to open shame, just as it is today.

(Ezra 9:8) 
And now, for a brief moment, a small remnant has been allowed to remain, and there is a place of safety among His holy people. Our God has enlightened our eyes and given us a small measure of relief in our bondage.

(Ezra 9:9) 
Though we are servants, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. Instead, He has extended His mercy to us in the sight of the king of Persia, so that He might give us new life. He has allowed us to rebuild the house of our God, to restore its desolate ruins, and to grant us a protective wall--a firm establishment--in Judah and Jerusalem.

(Ezra 9:10) 
And now, our God, what can we say after these things? For we have forsaken Your commandments,

(Ezra 9:11) 
which You commanded through the hand of Your servants, the prophets, saying: 'The land into which you are entering to possess it is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands and their detestable practices. They have filled it from one end to the other with their defilement.'

(Ezra 9:12) 
And now, you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons. You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity forever, so that you may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and pass it on as an inheritance to your children forever.

(Ezra 9:13) 
And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great transgression, since You, our God, have restrained Yourself from striking us down according to our iniquities, and have given us such salvation as we have today,

(Ezra 9:14) 
shall we then again violate Your commandments and join ourselves with these peoples who practice these detestable things? Will You not be angry with us even to utter destruction, so that there will be no remnant left, and no salvation?

(Ezra 9:15) 
O Lord, God of Israel, You are just! For we are left as a mere remnant, as it is this day. Behold, we are before You in our transgression--we cannot stand before You because of this.

(Ezra 9:1) 
After these things were done, once the city had been completed, the leaders of the people came to me, Ezra, and they said: 'The people of Israel have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples of the lands, nor from their abominable practices. They are intermarrying with the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.'

(Ezra 9:2) 
For they have taken wives from among the daughters of these foreign peoples for themselves and for their sons. This means they have mingled the holy seed of God's chosen people with the peoples of these other lands. And what is worse, the leaders and the rulers were the very first to commit this grave sin.

(Ezra 9:3) 
When I, Ezra, heard this report, I tore my outer cloak and my inner tunic, a sign of extreme anguish and grief. I pulled out hair from my head and my beard in despair, and I sat down, utterly heartbroken.

(Ezra 9:4) 
Then all those who deeply feared the word and law of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the great sin committed by those who had returned from exile. And I remained sitting in deep sorrow until the time of the evening sacrifice.

(Ezra 9:5) 
At the time of the evening sacrifice, I finally rose from my posture of humiliation and intense mourning. I knelt down, and I spread out my hands in supplication to the Lord, my God.

(Ezra 9:6) 
And I said, 'Oh my God, I am utterly ashamed and blush to even lift my face toward You, because our iniquities have multiplied so greatly that they are overwhelming us. Our offenses have grown so immense that they seem to reach up to the very sky.'

(Ezra 9:7) 
From the days of our ancestors right up to this very day, we have been in a state of great sin. Because of our iniquities, we ourselves, along with our kings and our priests, have been handed over into the power of the kings of foreign lands. We have been subjected to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to utter shame, a condition that remains evident even today.

(Ezra 9:8) 
And now, for what seems like a very brief and small moment, You have allowed us a remnant to survive. You have given us a secure foothold—a 'peg' in Your sanctuary, the Temple—establishing us firmly in Your holy place. Our God has enlightened our understanding, giving us hope, and has granted us a small measure of relief and refreshment in our continued servitude to foreign powers.

(Ezra 9:9) 
For even though we are servants, in our state of servitude, our God has not abandoned us. Instead, He has shown us great mercy in the eyes of the king of Persia, so that he would grant us relief and allow us to rebuild the house of our God, and restore its desolate ruins. He has also given us a protective wall and secure boundary in Judah and Jerusalem.

(Ezra 9:10) 
And now, O our God, what can we possibly say after all of this? For we have completely abandoned Your commandments, despite all Your mercy to us.

(Ezra 9:11) 
These are the commandments You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: 'The land you are entering to possess is an unclean land. It is defiled according to the impurity of the peoples of these lands. They have filled it with their abominable practices, from one end to the other, in their thorough defilement.'

(Ezra 9:12) 
You were told: 'You shall not give your daughters to their sons in marriage, nor shall you take their daughters as wives for your sons. You shall never seek their peace or their prosperity, for you must remain separate. Do this so that you may be strong, and be able to eat the good things of the land, and pass on a secure inheritance to your sons forever.'

(Ezra 9:13) 
And now, after all the calamities that have come upon us because of our very evil deeds and our great sin, even still, You, our God, have been merciful. You have spared us from the full punishment of our iniquity and have given us a measure of deliverance, as is evident today.

(Ezra 9:14) 
Shall we then again transgress Your commandments and join ourselves in marriage with these abominable peoples? If we do, will You not be so angry with us that You will utterly destroy us, leaving no remnant whatsoever, preventing any of us from surviving?

(Ezra 9:15) 
O Lord, God of Israel, You are perfectly just in all Your ways! It is only because of Your mercy that a remnant of us has been left to survive, as is evident today. Behold, we stand before You utterly condemned by our sin; indeed, we are unable to stand before You in this state of guilt.

(Ezra 10:1) 
So, while Ezra was praying and confessing his sins, weeping and lying prostrate before God’s Temple, a very large crowd from Israel gathered around him—men, women, and children alike. And all the people wept with deep sorrow.

(Ezra 10:2) 
Then Shechaniah, son of Jehiel, from the family of Elam, spoke to Ezra. He said: 'We have certainly sinned against our God by marrying foreign women from the surrounding nations. But even in this state, there remains hope for Israel to be restored.'

(Ezra 10:3) 
'So let us make a solemn covenant with our God. We must send away all these foreign wives and the children born from them. This must be done according to the clear will of the Lord and the desire of those who truly reverence the commandment of our Lord God. Let it be done strictly according to God’s Law.'

(Ezra 10:4) 
'Ezra, arise! This task is primarily yours, but we are with you to help. Be strong in the Lord, and carry out this command.'

(Ezra 10:5) 
So Ezra stood up. He then put all the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and everyone in Israel under oath to carry out this command. And they all took the oath.

(Ezra 10:6) 
Ezra then rose from his place before the Temple of God. He went to the living chamber of Johanan, son of Eliashib. While he stayed there, he refused to eat any bread or drink any water. He did this because he was deeply mourning the great sin committed by those who had returned from their captivity.

(Ezra 10:7) 
A proclamation was then sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of Israel. They were commanded to gather together in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 10:8) 
It was decreed that anyone who failed to come within three days, following the counsel of the leaders and elders, would have all their possessions confiscated. Furthermore, that person would be permanently cut off from the entire community of those who had returned from captivity.

(Ezra 10:9) 
So, within the specified three days, all the men from Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. This was on the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the people sat in the open square before the House of God, shivering from both their sin and the heavy rains that were falling.

(Ezra 10:10) 
Then Ezra the priest stood up and addressed them directly. He said: 'You have indeed transgressed God’s Law by marrying foreign women. By doing so, you have only added to the already great sin of Israel.'

(Ezra 10:11) 
'Now, confess your sins truly to the Lord God of your ancestors. Do His will exactly as He commands. Separate yourselves completely from the surrounding nations and from these foreign wives.'

(Ezra 10:12) 
Then the entire assembly responded to Ezra, shouting with one voice: 'What you have spoken to us, let it be done exactly as you say!'

(Ezra 10:13) 
They added: 'However, there are many of us here, and it is the rainy season, so we cannot remain standing outside in these conditions. This is a task that cannot be completed in just one or two days, for many of us have committed this great sin.'

(Ezra 10:14) 
'Let leaders be appointed from among the whole assembly. Then, let all who have married foreign women throughout our cities come forward at a set time, on a specific appointed day. They should come with the elders and judges of their respective cities. This process must continue until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this grave sin is finally turned away from us.'

(Ezra 10:15) 
However, Jonathan, son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, son of Tikvah, openly opposed this course of action. Meshullam and Shabbethai, a Levite, actively supported their opposition.

(Ezra 10:16) 
Despite the opposition, the sons of Israel proceeded with the plan. Ezra the priest, along with the designated heads of each family, assembled at the ancestral house. Each man was called by his name. They began to investigate this serious matter on the first day of the tenth month.

(Ezra 10:17) 
By the first day of the first month of the new year, they had completed the investigation concerning all the men who had married foreign women.

(Ezra 10:18) 
Among the descendants of the priests, these were found to have married foreign women: From the line of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his brothers, these were: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.

(Ezra 10:19) 
They swore an oath, giving their hands in agreement, to send away their wives. Furthermore, as an atonement for their great sin, they committed to offering a ram from the flocks.

(Ezra 10:34)

(Ezra 10:37)

(Ezra 10:38) 
Bani, Binnui, and Shimei.

(Ezra 10:39) 
Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah.

(Ezra 10:40) 
Machnadebai, Shashai, and Sharai.

(Ezra 10:1) 
When all these things were taking place, Ezra was praying, confessing the sins of the people, weeping, and lying prostrate before God’s temple. A very large assembly of men, women, and children from all of Israel gathered around him, and the people wept with great and loud lamentation.

(Ezra 10:2) 
Then Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke to Ezra and said: “We have sinned greatly against our God and have taken foreign wives from the peoples of the land. But even in this, there is still hope for Israel.”

(Ezra 10:3) 
“Therefore, let us now make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives and their children, according to the will of the Lord and of those who fear the commandments of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.”

(Ezra 10:4) 
“Rise up, Ezra, for this task is yours, and we are with you. Be strong, and carry it out.”

(Ezra 10:5) 
So Ezra rose up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all the people of Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this command. And they all swore the oath.

(Ezra 10:6) 
Then Ezra went from before the house of God and entered the chamber of Johanan, the son of Eliashib. When he went in there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he was still mourning over the unfaithfulness of those who had returned from captivity.

(Ezra 10:7) 
And they sent out a proclamation throughout all of Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, calling them to gather in Jerusalem.

(Ezra 10:8) 
Whoever did not come within three days, according to the decision of the leaders and elders, would have all his possessions confiscated, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.

(Ezra 10:9) 
So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling both because of their sin and because of the heavy rain.

(Ezra 10:10) 
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them: “You have trespassed and have taken foreign wives, thus adding to the guilt of Israel.”

(Ezra 10:11) 
“Now, therefore, give confession to the Lord, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from your foreign wives.”

(Ezra 10:12) 
Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, saying: “As you have said to us, so let it be done!”

(Ezra 10:13) 
“However, because there are many who have sinned in this matter, and it is the rainy season, we cannot stand outside. This work cannot be finished in just one or two days, for indeed, many of us have sinned grievously in this matter.”

(Ezra 10:14) 
“Therefore, let our leaders be appointed for the entire assembly. Let all those in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, along with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this sin is turned away from us.”

(Ezra 10:15) 
Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, opposed this plan; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them in their opposition.

(Ezra 10:16) 
The exiles did as they had agreed. Ezra the priest and certain men, heads of ancestral households, all designated by name, went to their homes. They began their investigation on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.

(Ezra 10:17) 
By the first day of the first month, they had finished dealing with all the men who had taken foreign wives.

(Ezra 10:18) 
Among the sons of the priests who had taken foreign wives were these: From the sons of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.

(Ezra 10:19) 
They gave their hands in solemn agreement to send away their wives, and for their guilt, they offered a ram from the flock as a sin offering.
