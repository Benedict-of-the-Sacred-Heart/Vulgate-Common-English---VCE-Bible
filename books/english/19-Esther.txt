(Esther 1:1) 
In the days of King Ahasuerus, who reigned from the lands of India even to the regions of Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.

(Esther 1:2) 
When he took his royal seat on the throne of his kingdom, in Susa, the royal capital city.

(Esther 1:3) 
In the third year of his reign, he held a grand feast for all his nobles and his royal officials—the most powerful leaders of the Persian and Median peoples—and for the governors of his provinces, all gathered before him.

(Esther 1:4) 
His purpose was to display the vast riches and glory of his kingdom, and the immense grandeur and impressive splendor of his power. This feast lasted for many days—specifically, one hundred and eighty days.

(Esther 1:5) 
After those many days of feasting were completed, the king then hosted a feast for all the people—everyone who lived in the royal capital city of Susa, from the most important to the least. This feast lasted for seven days, and it was held in the courtyard of the royal palace garden, a beautiful area carefully designed for royal events.

(Esther 1:6) 
From every side hung magnificent canopies woven from fine linen in sky-blue, white, and violet colors. These were held up by cords of fine linen and royal purple, attached to ivory rings and magnificent marble columns. Golden and silver couches were arranged, resting on a pavement made of precious green marble and white Parian stone, which was covered with colorful, intricately woven rugs.

(Esther 1:7) 
Those who were invited drank from splendid golden cups, and each cup was unique, differing in design from the others. The royal wine flowed freely, an abundant supply fit for a king's majesty.

(Esther 1:8) 
No one was forced to drink beyond their desire. Instead, the king had given specific instructions, assigning certain noble officials to oversee each table, ensuring that every guest could drink as much or as little as they pleased, according to their own will.

(Esther 1:9) 
Queen Vashti, for her part, also hosted a feast specifically for the women, held within the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.

(Esther 1:10) 
On the seventh day of the feast, when King Ahasuerus was feeling merry and his spirits had been excessively elevated by the wine, he issued a command to Mauman, Bazatha, Harbona, Bagatha, Abgatha, Zethar, and Charchas—the seven eunuchs who served directly in his royal presence.

(Esther 1:11) 
His command was to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence. She was to wear her royal crown, as his intention was to display her beauty to all the assembled peoples and nobles, for indeed, she was exceedingly beautiful.

(Esther 1:12) 
But Queen Vashti refused. She scorned the king's command, which had been delivered by his eunuchs, and would not come. The king became furious, inflamed with intense anger.

(Esther 1:13) 
He then consulted his wise men. These were the men who, by royal custom, always attended him, and all royal matters were decided according to their experienced judgment, for they were experts in the customs and laws of the age.

(Esther 1:14) 
These were his closest and most trusted advisors: Carshena, Sethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—the seven chief princes of Persia and Media. They had privileged access to the king and held the highest positions in the kingdom, ranking just below him.

(Esther 1:15) 
What legal royal judgment should be pronounced against Queen Vashti for her failure to obey the king's command, which was delivered through the eunuchs?

(Esther 1:16) 
Then Memucan spoke before the king and the assembled princes: 'Queen Vashti’s offense is not against the king alone, but also against all the princes and indeed all the peoples throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.'

(Esther 1:17) 
'For news of the queen’s actions will spread to all women. This will lead them to despise their own husbands and say, “King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to appear before him, and she refused!”'

(Esther 1:18) 
'Through this one example, all the wives of the nobles will begin to disregard their husbands' commands. Such behavior will bring sufficient contempt and anger.'

(Esther 1:19) 
'If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be issued in your presence, and let it be formally written into the laws of Persia and Media. This decree should state that Queen Vashti is never again permitted to enter the king’s presence. Furthermore, her royal position and honor should be given to another woman who proves herself more worthy than she.'

(Esther 1:20) 
'When this royal decree goes forth from your palace and is proclaimed throughout your entire, vast empire, all wives, both noblewomen and commoners, will then respect their husbands.'

(Esther 1:21) 
Memucan's words pleased both the king and his princes. So the king acted in accordance with Memucan's counsel.

(Esther 1:22) 
The king then sent official letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, written in the local script and language of each province. Their message was that every husband should be the undisputed master and authority in his own household, and this directive was to be made clear to all the peoples.

(Esther 1:1) 
In the days of Ahasuerus—this King Ahasuerus was the ruler who reigned from India all the way to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.

(Esther 1:2) 
At the time when he was seated upon the throne of his kingdom, the capital city of his reign was Susa.

(Esther 1:3) 
Therefore, in the third year of his reign, he prepared a grand feast for all his princes and his highest officials—including the most powerful among the Persians and Medes, and all the governors of the provinces—all gathered in his royal presence.

(Esther 1:4) 
This was so he could display the great wealth and glory of his kingdom, and the magnificence and boastful power of his rule, over the course of many days—specifically, for one hundred and eighty days.

(Esther 1:5) 
When those days of the grand feast were completed, he then commanded that all the people who were present in the city of Susa, from the most prominent to the least, should have a seven-day feast prepared. He ordered this to be arranged in the courtyard of the royal palace, and in the garden that was renowned for its royal design and marvelous craftsmanship.

(Esther 1:6) 
And there were hangings of purple, blue, fine white linen, and green fabrics, which served as luxurious curtains. There were also marble columns and gold pedestals, with couches of silver and gold for reclining. The floor itself was paved with precious stones: emerald, mother-of-pearl, and marble, all arranged in a wondrously diverse pattern.

(Esther 1:7) 
Those who had been invited drank from golden cups and various other vessels, each different from the last. They served drinks in an alternating and abundant fashion, in a manner befitting the king's great wealth and generosity.

(Esther 1:8) 
No one was forced to drink beyond their desire; instead, the king had instructed his servants that each person should be offered whatever they wished to drink, exactly as it pleased them.

(Esther 1:9) 
Queen Vasthi also prepared a separate feast for the women within the royal palace, in the very place where King Ahasuerus was accustomed to reside.

(Esther 1:10) 
On the seventh day, when the king was feeling particularly joyful and exuberant from the excessive pleasure of the wine, he commanded Mauman, Bazatha, Harbona, Bagatha, Abgatha, Zethar, and Charchas—these were the seven eunuchs who served in his royal presence.

(Esther 1:11) 
He commanded them to bring Queen Vasthi before the king, with her royal crown placed upon her head, so that he could display her beauty to all the people and princes, for she was exceptionally beautiful.

(Esther 1:12) 
But she refused, and disdained to come, contrary to the king's command which he had sent through his eunuchs. The king became enraged, burning with intense fury.

(Esther 1:13) 
He then consulted the wise men who, according to royal custom, always accompanied him, and through whose counsel he managed all his affairs and ruled his kingdom. These men were experts in the laws and ancient customs.

(Esther 1:14) 
Close to him were Charsena, Sethar, Admatha, Tharsis, Mares, Marsana, and Mamuchan—these seven princes of Persia and Media were his closest advisors, and they held the foremost positions in the kingdom.

(Esther 1:15) 
He asked them, 'What penalty does Queen Vasthi deserve by law, because she refused to obey the command of King Ahasuerus, which he sent through his eunuchs?'

(Esther 1:16) 
Then Mamuchan answered in the presence of the king and the other princes, 'Queen Vasthi has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes and all the peoples who live in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.'

(Esther 1:17) 
For the queen's action will become known among all women, leading them to disrespect their own husbands, by saying: 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vasthi to come to him, and she refused.'

(Esther 1:18) 
And by this example, all the wives of the princes of Persia and Media will likewise disdain the commands of their husbands, responding with equal boldness and indignation. From this will stem the king's most righteous indignation.

(Esther 1:19) 
If it pleases you, let a royal decree go forth from your presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and Medes, which cannot be changed, that Vasthi shall never again enter the presence of the king. Let another queen, who is better than she, reign in her place.

(Esther 1:20) 
And when this decree of the king, which will be promulgated throughout his entire empire, is heard by all the people—all wives, both of the great and the humble, will then show honor to their husbands.

(Esther 1:21) 
His proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king acted according to Mamuchan's counsel.

(Esther 1:22) 
And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, written in the various languages and scripts that each people could hear and read, decreeing that every man should be the ruler and master in his own household. This decree was to be publicly proclaimed to every single people.

(Esther 2:1) 
After these events, when King Ahasuerus’s anger subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what she had endured as a result.

(Esther 2:2) 
Then the king's young attendants and his ministers said: 'Let the most beautiful virgin girls be sought out for the king.'

(Esther 2:3) 
'Let officials be sent to search throughout all the provinces of your empire for beautiful young virgins and bring them to the city of Susa. There, they should be entrusted to Hegai, the king's eunuch and supervisor of the royal women. They should also be provided with special women's beauty treatments and all other necessities for their adornment.'

(Esther 2:4) 
'And whichever one of them pleases the king should then reign as queen instead of Vashti.' This suggestion pleased the king, and he commanded that it be done exactly as proposed.

(Esther 2:5) 
There was a Jewish man named Mordecai living in the city of Susa. He was the son of Jair, who was the son of Shimei, who was the son of Kish, and he was of the Benjaminite lineage.

(Esther 2:6) 
Mordecai had been taken captive and carried away from Jerusalem at the same time King Jeconiah of Judah was exiled—when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had forcibly removed the Jewish people from their land.

(Esther 2:7) 
Mordecai was the guardian of his uncle’s daughter, Hadassah, who was also known by her Persian name, Esther. She was an exceptionally beautiful and charming girl. After her father and mother had died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter.

(Esther 2:8) 
So when the king's orders and decree were proclaimed, many beautiful girls were brought to Susa and entrusted to Hegai. Esther, along with the other lovely girls, was also given to Hegai, so she could be cared for among the royal women.

(Esther 2:9) 
Esther pleased Hegai and gained his confidence by her demeanor. He immediately commanded that her beauty treatments be hastened, and he provided her with a special diet. He also assigned her the best of the king's maidservants. Along with fifty other selected virgin attendants, Hegai entrusted Esther and her maidservants to a prepared living arrangement and personally saw to the adornment of both Esther and her chamber.

(Esther 2:10) 
Esther had not disclosed her nationality or her heritage, because Mordecai had strictly commanded her not to speak of it to anyone.

(Esther 2:11) 
Daily, Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the courtyard of the house where the beautiful girls were being kept. He was constantly concerned for Esther’s well-being and eager to know what would happen to her.

(Esther 2:12) 
Now, each girl had to complete her full preparation before going in to the king. This entire regimen of beauty treatments lasted twelve months: for six months, she would be anointed with oil and myrrh, and for the remaining six months, with perfumes and other substances necessary for adornment.

(Esther 2:13) 
When it was her turn to enter the king’s presence, she was allowed to take with her from the women’s quarters any items she desired for her personal adornment and bring them to the king's chamber.

(Esther 2:14) 
The girl who went in to the king in the evening would leave in the morning and go to a second palace for the royal women. This residence was under the charge of Shaashgaz, another eunuch, who supervised the king’s concubines. After this, she could no longer return to the king's presence unless the king specifically desired her and personally summoned her by name.

(Esther 2:15) 
When the time came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail (Mordecai’s brother) whom Mordecai had adopted as his daughter, to enter the king’s presence, she chose nothing for herself beyond what Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the women, advised. Esther was, in fact, exceedingly beautiful and possessed an incredible charm; everyone who saw her was captivated by her appearance.

(Esther 2:16) 
So Esther entered King Ahasuerus’s royal palace in the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.

(Esther 2:17) 
The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found more favor and kindness in his sight than all the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in Vashti’s place.

(Esther 2:18) 
The king then commanded a great banquet to be prepared for all his princes and servants, in celebration of Esther’s marriage and coronation. He also declared a special holiday for the provinces, and distributed gifts with royal generosity, in keeping with his magnificent status.

(Esther 2:19) 
Later, when virgins were again gathered according to custom for subsequent preparations—though Esther was now queen—Mordecai remained stationed at the royal gates.

(Esther 2:20) 
Esther continued to conceal her nationality and heritage, just as Mordecai had commanded her. Indeed, she observed and carried out all his instructions as if she were still under his direct authority.

(Esther 2:21) 
At that very time, while Mordecai was stationed at the royal gates, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bagathan and Teresh, became indignant. These men were doorkeepers who guarded the first entrance to the palace. They conspired to attack and assassinate King Ahasuerus.

(Esther 2:22) 
Mordecai soon discovered this plot. He immediately reported it to Queen Esther, and she, in turn, informed the king about the matter, crediting Mordecai by name.

(Esther 2:23) 
The king investigated the matter and confirmed the plot by both men. He then commanded that both of them be executed. Immediately, a detailed account of their crime was recorded in the royal annals, among the records of both ancient and recent kings.

(Esther 3:1) 
After these events, King Ahasuerus elevated Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of Agag, and established his authority above all the other officials and leaders in his kingdom.

(Esther 3:2) 
And all the servants of the king, who were at the palace gates, would kneel and pay homage to Haman, because the king had ordered them to do so. But Mordecai would not kneel, nor would he pay him homage.

(Esther 3:3) 
The king's pages, who were standing at the palace gates, asked Mordecai, "Why do you not obey the king's custom?"

(Esther 3:4) 
When they had repeatedly told him this, and he refused to listen, they reported it to Haman, wanting to see if Mordecai would persist in his refusal, for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.

(Esther 3:5) 
When Haman heard this and confirmed through observation that Mordecai would not kneel or pay him homage, he became extremely angry.

(Esther 3:6) 
Haman considered it a small thing to lay hands only on Mordecai, for he had heard about Mordecai’s lineage. Instead, Haman decided to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the entire kingdom of Ahasuerus—that is, Mordecai's people.

(Esther 3:7) 
In the first month, called Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus's reign, lots were cast into an urn in Haman's presence, to determine by which day and month the Jewish people should be destroyed. This method of casting lots is called Pur in Hebrew. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.

(Esther 3:8) 
Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people dispersed among the nations in all the provinces of your kingdom. They are separate from other peoples, using their own new laws and customs, and they disregard the traditions of others. They also refuse to obey the king's commands. It is not beneficial for the king to tolerate such a people."

(Esther 3:9) 
"If it pleases you, issue a decree that they should perish. I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for your officials."

(Esther 3:10) 
So the king took his signet ring from his hand, which he had given to Haman, and handed it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, of the lineage of Agag—the enemy of the Jews.

(Esther 3:11) 
And the king said to him, "The silver you promised is yours. As for the people, do with them whatever you please."

(Esther 3:12) 
The king's scribes were summoned in the first month, Nisan, on the thirteenth day of that month. A decree was written, exactly as Haman had commanded, addressed to all the king's satraps, the governors of the provinces, and the princes of the regions, from India to Ethiopia—one hundred twenty-seven provinces in all. The decree was written for each people in their own language and script, according to their own national customs, under the authority of King Ahasuerus, and sealed with his signet ring.

(Esther 3:13) 
Letters were sent by royal couriers to all the provinces, ordering them to destroy all the Jews—from young children to old men, including infants and women—on a single day, which was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called Adar. Their possessions were also to be plundered.

(Esther 3:14) 
The text of the letter stated that this command was to be issued in all lands, so that all peoples would know and be prepared for the appointed day.

(Esther 3:15) 
The couriers who had been sent quickly departed to carry out the king's command. Immediately, the edict was displayed in Susa, the capital city. While the king and Haman celebrated with a feast, all the Jews wept and mourned.

(Esther 3:1) 
After these events, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of Agag, and placed his seat of authority above all the other officials under him.

(Esther 3:2) 
And all the king’s servants who were at the palace gate would bend their knees and prostrate themselves before Haman, because the king had commanded them to do so. However, Mordecai alone would not bend his knee, nor would he prostrate himself.

(Esther 3:3) 
To him, the king’s attendants who were daily present at the palace gate spoke: “Why do you not obey the king’s commands, acting against his custom?”

(Esther 3:4) 
But when he refused to listen to them and stubbornly persisted in his resolve, they informed Haman, desiring to know if Mordecai’s actions would be tolerated. For Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew, which prevented him from bowing to Haman.

(Esther 3:5) 
When Haman heard this, and verified for himself that Mordecai would not bend his knee nor prostrate himself before him, he became exceedingly furious.

(Esther 3:6) 
He considered it a trivial matter to lay hands on Mordecai alone, as killing just him was not enough vengeance. For he had been informed of Mordecai’s Jewish lineage. And so, he wanted to destroy all the Jews who were in the kingdom of Ahasuerus along with Mordecai; that is to say, he wanted to destroy the entire Jewish nation.

(Esther 3:7) 
In the first month, which is called Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus’s reign, a lot was cast into an urn—which in Hebrew is called Pur—in Haman’s presence, to determine the exact day and month when the Jewish people should be massacred. And the lot fell upon the twelfth month, which is called Adar, giving Haman nearly a year to execute his plan.

(Esther 3:8) 
Then Haman spoke to King Ahasuerus: “There is a certain people dispersed throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and they are separated from one another, using novel laws and ceremonies. Moreover, they despise the king’s laws. And you know very well that it is not in your kingdom’s best interest for such a people to grow insolent and powerful.”

(Esther 3:9) 
“If it pleases you, issue a decree that they perish. And I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver to the king’s treasurers.”

(Esther 3:10) 
Therefore, the king took his signet ring, which he used, from his hand, and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, of the lineage of Agag—the enemy of the Jews.

(Esther 3:11) 
And the king said to him: “Keep the silver you promised for yourself. As for this people, do with them as you please.”

(Esther 3:12) 
So the king’s scribes were summoned in the first month, on the fourteenth day of that same month. And it was written, just as Haman had commanded, to all the king’s satraps, and to the governors of the provinces, and to the officials, from the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which were under the dominion of King Ahasuerus, from India all the way to Ethiopia. And to each province, in its own language and script, in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed with his own signet ring, making the decree official and binding.

(Esther 3:13) 
And letters were sent by swift couriers to all the king’s provinces, to crush and kill all the Jews—from young boy to old man, little children and women—on a single day. That day was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. They were also commanded to plunder their possessions.

(Esther 3:14) 
So that the decree might be proclaimed in all the provinces and become known to all peoples, they should be ready for the day of killing.

(Esther 3:15) 
The couriers hastened, carrying the king’s decree. And immediately, the law was posted in Susa, the capital city. While the king and Haman celebrated at a banquet, all the Jews began to mourn and lament.

(Esther 4:1) 
When Mordecai heard all that was happening to the Jewish people, he tore his clothes—a common sign of great distress—put on sackcloth, and sprinkled ashes on his head. Then, in the middle of the city square, he cried out with a loud and bitter voice, making his intense grief and the great bitterness of his soul known to everyone.

(Esther 4:2) 
He went as far as the king's gate, but no further. It was not permitted for anyone dressed in sackcloth, as a sign of mourning, to enter the royal courtyard.

(Esther 4:3) 
In all the provinces, cities, and places where the king’s decree and his command for their destruction had arrived, there was great lamentation among the Jewish people. They engaged in fasting, wailing, and weeping, with many even using sackcloth and ashes as their bedding as a sign of their sorrow and repentance.

(Esther 4:4) 
Then Esther’s young women and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai's public display of mourning. When she heard this, Queen Esther was greatly dismayed and deeply troubled, so she sent him a change of clothes so he could put off the sackcloth. But he refused to accept them.

(Esther 4:5) 
Immediately, Esther summoned Hathach, a eunuch who was assigned to attend her in her personal chambers. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out from him why he was doing this public display of grief.

(Esther 4:6) 
So Hathach went out to Mordecai, who was still in the city square near the king’s gate.

(Esther 4:7) 
Mordecai told Hathach everything that had happened, including how Haman had promised to put a vast sum of money into the royal treasury in exchange for the destruction and massacre of the Jewish people.

(Esther 4:8) 
Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the written decree concerning their annihilation, which was posted publicly in Susa. He instructed Hathach to show it to the queen and to urge her to go in to the king and plead for her people, the Jews.

(Esther 4:9) 
Hathach returned to the palace and reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said to him.

(Esther 4:10) 
Esther then replied to Hathach, giving him a message to deliver to Mordecai, saying:

(Esther 4:11) 
"All the king’s servants and all the provinces under his dominion know that for anyone, regardless of gender or age, who enters the king's inner court without being summoned, there is only one fixed sentence: that person shall be put to death. The sole exception is if the king extends his golden scepter to them, allowing them to live. As for me, I have not been summoned to the king for thirty days now, which puts my life in danger if I approach him unbidden."

(Esther 4:12) 
When Mordecai heard this message from Esther, he ordered that she be told in return:

(Esther 4:13) 
"Do not think that because you are in the king’s palace, you alone among all the Jewish people will escape this fate and save your own life."

(Esther 4:14) 
"For if you remain silent at this critical moment—failing to intercede for your people—relief and deliverance for the Jewish people will certainly arise from another source and by another means. However, you and your father’s household will perish for your inaction. And who knows if you have come to your royal position for precisely such a time as this, so that you might help your people and save them from destruction?"

(Esther 4:15) 
Then Esther sent this reply back to Mordecai, saying:

(Esther 4:16) 
"Go, gather all the Jewish people whom you find in Susa, and pray for me. Do not eat or drink for three days and three nights, beginning now. My young women and I will also fast in the same way. After this period of prayer and fasting, I will go in to the king, even though it is strictly against the royal law to do so without being summoned. And if I must perish by breaking this law, then I shall perish."

(Esther 4:17) 
So Mordecai went away and did everything that Queen Esther had commanded him, gathering the Jews for prayer and fasting.

(Esther 4:1) 
Mordecai, having heard all that had happened to the Jewish people, tore his garments. He put on sackcloth, a sign of deep mourning, and sprinkled ashes on his head. He then ran through the city square, up to the king's gate, crying out loudly and wailing in great distress.

(Esther 4:2) 
He went as far as the king's courtyard. He could not enter the royal gate, for no one clothed in sackcloth was permitted to do so.

(Esther 4:3) 
In all the provinces, cities, and places where the king's command and the decree had been proclaimed, there was great weeping, mourning, and wailing among the Jews. Many used sackcloth and ashes as their bed, a sign of extreme sorrow.

(Esther 4:4) 
Esther's maidservants and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai. When she heard this, she was immediately greatly troubled. She sent clothes for him to wear, so he could take off the sackcloth, but he refused to accept them.

(Esther 4:5) 
So Esther summoned Hathach, one of the eunuchs the king had assigned to attend her. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out why he was acting this way.

(Esther 4:6) 
Hathach went out to Mordecai, who was standing in the city square in front of the king's gate.

(Esther 4:7) 
Mordecai told him everything that had happened, including how Haman had promised to pay a large sum of money into the king's treasury for the extermination of the Jews.

(Esther 4:8) 
He also gave Hathach a copy of the decree that had been posted in Susa, the capital, so he could show it to the Queen. Mordecai urged her to go to the King and plead with him for her people.

(Esther 4:9) 
When Hathach returned, he reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said.

(Esther 4:10) 
Then Esther instructed Hathach to tell Mordecai in reply:

(Esther 4:11) 
All the king's servants and all the people in the provinces under his rule know this: if any man or woman approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned, there is only one law. They are immediately put to death, unless the king extends his golden scepter to them, allowing them to live. I, however, have not been summoned to the king for thirty days now.

(Esther 4:12) 
When Mordecai heard what Esther had said and reported back to her,

(Esther 4:13) 
He sent back this reply to her: 'Do not imagine that you alone, in the king's house, will escape the fate of all the other Jews.'

(Esther 4:14) 
'For if you remain silent now, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another source. But you and your father's family will perish. Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?'

(Esther 4:15) 
Esther then sent this message in reply to Mordecai:

(Esther 4:16) 
'Go and gather all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidservants will fast in the same way. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law — and if I perish, I perish.'

(Esther 4:17) 
So Mordecai went and did everything Esther had commanded him.

(Esther 4:18) 
Then Mordecai prayed to the Lord, remembering all the works of the Lord, and said:

(Esther 4:19) 
'O Lord, Lord, Almighty King, all things are in your power, and there is no one who can resist your will if you choose to save Israel.'

(Esther 4:20) 
'You made the universe and the earth, and whatever is contained within the expanse of the sky.'

(Esther 4:21) 
'You are the Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist your majesty.'

(Esther 4:22) 
'And now, O Lord God, King, mighty and powerful, and having all authority and power, all things bow before you and fear your presence.'

(Esther 4:23) 
'And now I implore you, God of Israel, look favorably upon your people and upon the tribulation of the Jews. For they desire to exterminate us and to destroy your heritage.'

(Esther 4:24) 
'Do not despise your portion, the people whom you redeemed from Egypt.'

(Esther 4:25) 
'Hear my prayer, and be merciful to your chosen people and your inheritance. Turn our mourning into joy, so that we who live may praise your name, O Lord, and do not close the mouths of those who sing to you.'

(Esther 4:26) 
All Israel cried out to the Lord with all their heart's desire, for they had been called to imminent death.

(Esther 4:27) 
Queen Esther also took refuge in the Lord, fearing the danger that was hanging over them.

(Esther 4:28) 
She took off her glorious royal garments. She put on clothes of sorrow and mourning. Instead of various perfumes, she poured unclean ashes and dung on her head. She humbled her body by fasting, and she defiled all her hair, which was accustomed to being adorned. She then prayed to the Lord God of Israel, saying:

(Esther 4:29) 
'My Lord, who alone is our King, help me who am alone. I have no other helper but you, for danger is in my hands.'

(Esther 4:30) 
'I have heard from my father that you, O Lord, chose Israel from all the nations. You chose our fathers from among all their ancestors to be your eternal possession, and you did for them according to your will.'

(Esther 4:31) 
'And now we have sinned in your sight, and because of this, you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies.'

(Esther 4:32) 
'Because we worshipped their gods, you are just, O Lord, in punishing us.'

(Esther 4:33) 
'And now it is not enough for them that they oppress us with the harshest servitude. Attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols, they wish to transfer your kingdom, destroy your inheritance, close the mouths of those who praise you, and extinguish the glory of your temple and your altar.'

(Esther 4:34) 
'They do this so that the mouths of the Gentiles may be opened, and they may praise the power of their idols and eternally magnify a fleshly king.'

(Esther 4:35) 
'Do not surrender your scepter, O Lord, to those who are nothing, so that they may not mock our destruction. Instead, turn their counsel back upon themselves and destroy the one who began to rage against us.'

(Esther 4:36) 
'Remember us, O Lord, and reveal yourself to us in the time of our tribulation. Give me courage, O Lord, King of gods and of all power.'

(Esther 4:37) 
'Put a fitting speech in my mouth when I am before the king, the lion, and turn his heart to hatred of the one who attacks us, so that he himself may perish, and those who agree with him.'

(Esther 4:38) 
'But deliver us by your hand, and help me, who am alone and have no other helper but you, O Lord.'

(Esther 4:39) 
'You know everything, and you know that I hate the glory of the wicked. I detest the abomination of the uncircumcised and of every foreigner.'

(Esther 4:40) 
'You know my necessity, that I abhor the symbol of my pride and glory, that is, the tiara which is on my head during my days of public display. I detest it like a defiled cloth, and I do not wear it during my days of quiet prayer and mourning.'

(Esther 5:1) 
On the third day, Queen Esther put on her royal robes, and she went to stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace. This courtyard was in front of the palace’s entrance hall. The King was seated on his royal throne inside the palace, directly opposite the entrance.

(Esther 5:2) 
When the king saw Queen Esther standing there, her appearance pleased him. So he extended the golden scepter he held in his hand toward her. She then approached him and kissed the very tip of the scepter.

(Esther 5:3) 
The King said to her: "What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? Whatever it is, even if it’s half of my kingdom, you will receive it."

(Esther 5:4) 
She replied: "If it pleases the King, please come, O King, and bring Haman with you today to the banquet I have prepared."

(Esther 5:5) 
Immediately the King commanded: "Quickly, call Haman, so that he may fulfill the Queen’s wish." So the King and Haman came to the banquet that Queen Esther had prepared for them.

(Esther 5:6) 
After the King had already drunk some wine, he said to Queen Esther: "What do you request, so that it may be given to you? What do you wish to be done? Even if you ask for half of my kingdom, you shall have it."

(Esther 5:7) 
Queen Esther replied: "My request and my plea are these:"

(Esther 5:8) 
"If I have found favor in the King’s eyes, and if it pleases the King to grant what I ask and to fulfill my request, then let the King and Haman come to the banquet I have prepared for them. And tomorrow, I will do as I have done today—preparing another banquet and continuing to delay my true petition."

(Esther 5:9) 
So Haman left that day joyful and in good spirits. But when he saw Mordecai sitting at the palace gate, and observed that Mordecai neither stood up for him nor even moved from his seat, Haman became extremely angry.

(Esther 5:10) 
So he returned to his home and immediately called together his friends and his wife, Zeresh.

(Esther 5:11) 
He boasted to them about the vast extent of his riches, the multitude of his sons, and how greatly the King had honored him, elevating him above all the other officials and servants.

(Esther 5:12) 
And after all this, he added: "Queen Esther invited no one else to the King’s banquet but me! And what’s more, for tomorrow, she is prepared to have the King and me come again for another banquet!"

(Esther 5:13) 
"But all these honors mean nothing to me," he declared, "as often as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the royal gate."

(Esther 5:14) 
His wife Zeresh and all his other friends replied to him: "Order a very tall gallows, fifty cubits high, to be prepared. Then, in the morning, speak to the King so that Mordecai may be hanged upon it. After that, you can go joyfully with the King to the banquet." This advice pleased Haman, and he ordered a very tall gallows to be made.

(Esther 6:1) 
That night, the king couldn't sleep. He ordered that the royal records, containing stories and chronicles from earlier times, be brought to him. As they were being read aloud in his presence,

(Esther 6:2) 
they came to a place in the records where it was written how Mordecai had revealed the plot of Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs who had wanted to kill the king.

(Esther 6:3) 
The king asked, "What honor or reward has Mordecai received for this act of loyalty?" His servants and ministers replied, "He has received absolutely nothing."

(Esther 6:4) 
Immediately the king asked, "Who is in the courtyard right now?" At that very moment, Haman had entered the outer courtyard of the royal palace to suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for him.

(Esther 6:5) 
The king's servants answered, "Haman is standing in the courtyard." And the king said, "Let him come in."

(Esther 6:6) 
When Haman had come in, the king asked him, "What should be done for a man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman, thinking to himself and not suspecting that anyone else but himself would be worthy of such honor,

(Esther 6:7) 
answered, "For the man whom the king wishes to honor,

(Esther 6:8) 
he should be dressed in the royal robe that the king himself has worn, and be mounted on the horse that the king himself rides, and have a royal diadem placed upon his head.

(Esther 6:9) 
Then, one of the king's noblest princes and leading officials should hold his horse, and as he walks through the city square, he should proclaim and say: 'Thus shall the man be honored, whom the king desires to honor!'

(Esther 6:10) 
The king then said to Haman, "Hurry! Take the royal robe and the horse, and do exactly as you have said for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the palace gate. Be careful not to omit anything you have spoken."

(Esther 6:11) 
So Haman took the royal robe and the horse. He dressed Mordecai and placed him upon the horse. Then Haman went ahead of him through the city square, shouting, "This is the honor fitting for the man whom the king desires to honor!"

(Esther 6:12) 
Mordecai then returned to the palace gate. Haman hurried home, grieving and with his head covered in shame.

(Esther 6:13) 
He told Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends everything that had happened to him. The wise men he had for counsel, and his wife Zeresh, answered him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not be able to stand against him; instead, you will surely fall before him."

(Esther 6:14) 
While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and quickly compelled Haman to come to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

(Esther 7:1) 
So the king and Haman came to drink with Queen Esther.

(Esther 7:2) 
And on the second day, when the king was warm from the wine, he said to her: "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be granted to you, and whatever you wish will be done for you."

(Esther 7:3) 
She answered him: "If I have found favor in your eyes, O King, and if it pleases you, grant me my life, for which I ask, and spare my people, for whom I beg."

(Esther 7:4) 
For my people and I have been delivered up to be utterly crushed, killed, and destroyed. If we had only been sold as slaves and handmaidens, the evil would have been tolerable, and I would not have troubled the king for such a small matter. But now our enemy is one whose cruelty will also harm the king.

(Esther 7:5) 
King Ahasuerus replied, saying: "Who is this man, and by whose authority does he dare to do such things?"

(Esther 7:6) 
And Esther said: "Our enemy and adversary is this most wicked Haman!" When Haman heard this, he was utterly disturbed, and his face fell completely at what the king and queen had spoken.

(Esther 7:7) 
The king, enraged, rose from the banquet and went into the garden, which had been designed with many different kinds of trees and plantings. Haman also rose to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he understood that the king had already prepared evil for him.

(Esther 7:8) 
When the king returned from the wooded garden and entered the banquet hall, Haman was lying on the couch where the queen was reclining. And the king said: "Does he even intend to oppress the queen in my presence, in my own house?" The words had barely left the king's mouth when they immediately covered Haman's face.

(Esther 7:9) 
Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs who attended the king, said: "Look, the gallows that Haman prepared for Mordecai, who spoke up for the king, stands in Haman's house. It is fifty cubits high." To this, the king said: "Hang Haman upon it!"

(Esther 7:10) 
So Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. And the king's anger was appeased.

(Esther 8:1) 
That day, King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai was brought before the king, because Esther had explained that Mordecai was her relative and guardian.

(Esther 8:2) 
The king then took back his signet ring, which he had ordered to be taken from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai, giving him authority. And Queen Esther appointed Mordecai to manage the entire estate of Haman.

(Esther 8:3) 
But Esther was not content with only these things. She fell at the king’s feet, weeping, and she pleaded with him, asking that he would void Haman the Agagite’s wickedness and the very evil schemes he had devised against the Jewish people.

(Esther 8:4) 
So the king extended his golden scepter towards Esther, which was the sign that she was allowed to approach him and speak without fear of punishment. She immediately rose and stood before him.

(Esther 8:5) 
And she said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if this matter seems right to me, and if it is acceptable to the king, I beg that by new decrees, the former letters of Haman—that most wicked destroyer of the Jews in all the king's provinces—be ordered to be amended, or corrected."

(Esther 8:6) 
"For how can I endure to see the destruction of my people and the slaughter of my relatives?"

(Esther 8:7) 
King Ahasuerus then responded to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, saying, "I have already granted Haman’s property to Esther, and I ordered Haman himself to be hanged on the gallows because he dared to attack the Jews."

(Esther 8:8) 
"Therefore, write new decrees to the Jews as you please, in my name, and seal them with my royal signet ring. For it was the custom that no one dared to contradict the king's official decrees once they were sealed with his ring, making them unchangeable."

(Esther 8:9) 
So the king's scribes and secretaries were called immediately. It was the twenty-third day of the third month, which is called Sivan. And letters were written exactly as Mordecai desired: to the Jewish people, and to the satraps, governors, and judges who ruled over the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were sent to each province and each people according to their languages and customs, and specifically to the Jews, so they could all read and understand the decree.

(Esther 8:10) 
Mordecai himself also wrote the decrees in the king’s name and sealed them with the king’s signet ring. He then sent the letters by swift couriers and royal horsemen who were official messengers of the king.

(Esther 8:11) 
To these messengers, Mordecai gave the command that they should go to the Jewish people in all the provinces and permit them to gather together to stand up and defend their lives. They were also permitted to kill all their enemies—including their wives and children—and to utterly destroy everything that threatened them, even to the point of extermination, and to take their possessions as plunder. This decree allowed the Jews to defend themselves with the same power that Haman's decree had granted their enemies.

(Esther 8:12) 
And one specific day was appointed throughout all the provinces in the entire empire of King Ahasuerus for this defense: the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. This was the same day that Haman had originally chosen for their destruction.

(Esther 8:13) 
Therefore, a copy of the decree was to be published in all provinces and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews would be prepared for the day they could defend themselves against their enemies.

(Esther 8:14) 
And the swift couriers, who were sent by the king's command, went out immediately. The decree was publicly posted without delay in the city of Susa.

(Esther 8:15) 
But Mordecai, having left the king's palace and his immediate presence, was dressed in royal robes of purple and blue, wearing a golden crown, and clothed in cloaks of fine linen and scarlet. These were all symbols of his new, high honor and authority. And the entire city of Susa rejoiced and was glad at this change in fortune.

(Esther 8:16) 
For the Jewish people, a new light of hope had dawned. There was joy, exultation, and great honor for them.

(Esther 8:17) 
And in all the provinces and cities where the king's command and decree had arrived, the Jewish people celebrated with feasts, joy, banquets, and a day of festival. Many of the peoples of the land, seeing this turn of events, converted and joined their sect and religion, for the fear and respect for the Jewish people had now fallen upon all.

(Esther 9:1) 
On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called the month of Adar, when the extermination of all the Jews had been planned, and their enemies were eager for their blood, the Jews, instead, became the victors and took vengeance on their adversaries.

(Esther 9:2) 
The Jews gathered in every city, town, and village to defend themselves and to kill their enemies and persecutors. No one dared to resist them, because terror had gripped the hearts of all people.

(Esther 9:3) 
Indeed, the judges of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and every dignitary who presided over individual places honored the Jews, because the fear of Mordechai had fallen upon them.

(Esther 9:4) 
For Mordechai was powerful in the palace, and the fame of his name had spread throughout all the provinces; for everyone announced that Mordechai's people were mighty.

(Esther 9:5) 
So the Jews struck all their enemies with a great slaughter, killing them and giving back to them what they had intended for the Jews.

(Esther 9:6) 
Also, in the city of Susa, the Jews killed five hundred men.

(Esther 9:7) 
And Pharsandatha, Dalphon, and Aspatha,

(Esther 9:8) 
and Poratha, Adalia, and Aridatha,

(Esther 9:9) 
and Parmastha, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha—

(Esther 9:10) 
these were the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha, the adversary of the Jews, whom they killed. But they did not take their plunder.

(Esther 9:11) 
The number of those killed in Susa was immediately reported to the king.

(Esther 9:12) 
The king then said to Queen Esther, "In the city of Susa, the Jews have killed five hundred men, including Haman's ten sons. How great a slaughter do you think they have carried out in all the other provinces? What more do you request, and what else do you want me to command to be done?"

(Esther 9:13) 
Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews in Susa that they may act tomorrow just as they have acted today. And let Haman's ten sons be hanged on gallows."

(Esther 9:14) 
And the king commanded that it should be done. Immediately, the king's decree was proclaimed in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged.

(Esther 9:15) 
The Jews in Susa also continued on the fifteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred more men, but they did not take their plunder.

(Esther 9:16) 
But the Jews who lived in the other provinces gathered to defend their lives and to pursue their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, and they touched none of their possessions.

(Esther 9:17) 
All these things were done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day of the same month, they ceased all killing and dedicated themselves to feasting and rejoicing.

(Esther 9:18) 
However, those who had carried out the killing in Susa fought both on the thirteenth and the fifteenth days of the month of Adar; they ceased on the fifteenth. Therefore, it has been observed by the Jews who lived in the walled towns that they should appoint the fourteenth day of Adar as a day of joy and feasting,

(Esther 9:19) 
and a festive day on which they send portions of food to one another. But those who are in unwalled cities and in villages decree the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, so that they may be joyful in their celebrations and send food to one another.

(Esther 9:20) 
So Mordechai wrote down all these things and sent letters to all the Jews who lived in all the provinces of King Artaxerxes, both near and far,

(Esther 9:21) 
that they should establish the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as annual festive days for themselves.

(Esther 9:22) 
This was because on those days, the Jews had been avenged on their enemies, and their sorrow and sadness had been turned into joy and gladness. They were to make them days of feasting and rejoicing, and to send portions of food to one another, and to give alms to the poor and needy.

(Esther 9:23) 
And the Jews took into custom all that they had begun to do and all that Mordechai had written to them.

(Esther 9:24) 
This was because Haman, son of Hammedatha, of the race of Agag, the adversary and enemy of the Jews, had plotted evil against them to kill and destroy them; and he had cast "pur," which means "the lot."

(Esther 9:25) 
And afterwards, when he had gone in to the king to order the Jews to perish, Esther interceded with the king. And by the king's decision, it was commanded that Haman's wicked scheme, which he had devised against the Jews through his letters and malice, should recoil upon his own head and the heads of his sons, and that he and his offspring should be hanged on gallows.

(Esther 9:26) 
And from that time, these days were called Purim, that is, "of Lots," because "pur," that is, "the lot," had been cast. And all that had happened, and what then occurred,

(Esther 9:27) 
the Jews resolved for themselves, and for their descendants, and for all who wished to join them, that no one should be permitted to transgress, and that they should keep these festive days as an everlasting observance for themselves from generation to generation.

(Esther 9:28) 
These days were to be remembered and solemnized throughout the entire world, by individual families, and cities, and provinces. No festive day was to be allowed to fall into disuse, but rather to be continually renewed with celebration.

(Esther 9:29) 
Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, and Mordechai the Jew, then wrote with all their authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.

(Esther 9:30) 
And they sent words of peace and truth to all the Jews who were in the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of King Artaxerxes,

(Esther 9:31) 
and commanded that the days of the Lots should be observed and celebrated at their appointed time, just as Mordechai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and as they themselves had ordained for themselves and their descendants, with fasting, lamentation, and rejoicing.

(Esther 9:32) 
And all things pertaining to Purim are contained in one volume, and the authenticity of that command has been proven.

(Esther 10:1) 
King Ahasuerus then issued a decree for a tax throughout his entire kingdom and extending even to the farthest islands.

(Esther 10:2) 
All the accomplishments of his reign, his mighty acts, his imperial glory, and the powerful position to which he elevated Mordecai, are recorded in the official chronicles of the kingdoms of Media and Persia.

(Esther 10:3) 
And how Mordecai, a Jew, became the second highest authority after King Ahasuerus; he was greatly respected among his own people, the Jews, and was highly esteemed by all his kinsmen, always working for the welfare of his people and speaking words that served the benefit of many.
