(Daniel 1:1) 
In the third year of the reign of Joakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

(Daniel 1:2) 
And the Lord gave Joakim, the king of Judah, into his hand, along with a portion of the vessels of the house of God, and he carried them off to the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god. He then placed the vessels in the house of the treasury of his god.

(Daniel 1:3) 
Then the king spoke to Asphenez, the chief of the eunuchs, ordering him to bring in some of the sons of Israel, both from the royal family and from the nobles,

(Daniel 1:4) 
young men without any defects, handsome, and skilled in all wisdom, learned, and possessing knowledge, and those who could stand in the king's palace, so that they might teach them the letters and the language of the Chaldeans.

(Daniel 1:5) 
Among them were Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, who were from the sons of Judah.

(Daniel 1:6) 
And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Belteshazzar; to Ananias, Shadrach; to Misael, Meshach; and to Azarias, Abed-nego.

(Daniel 1:7) 
But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food or with the wine that he drank. Therefore, he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled.

(Daniel 1:8) 
And God gave Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs.

(Daniel 1:9) 
And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. If he sees your faces looking worse than those of the other young men of your age, what will happen to my head because of you?”

(Daniel 1:10) 
Then Daniel said to the guard whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:

(Daniel 1:11) 
“Please test us for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.

(Daniel 1:12) 
Then let our faces be examined before you, as well as the faces of the young men who eat the king's food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”

(Daniel 1:13) 
So, when he heard this, he tested them for ten days.

(Daniel 1:14) 
And after ten days, their faces appeared better and their bodies more robust than all the young men who ate the king's food.

(Daniel 1:15) 
So Malasar continued to provide them with food and drink and vegetables.

(Daniel 1:16) 
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom. And Daniel understood all visions and dreams.

(Daniel 1:17) 
When the time came for them to be brought in, as the king had commanded, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

(Daniel 1:18) 
And when the king spoke with them, he found none like Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias. So they stood before the king.

(Daniel 1:19) 
And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in his whole kingdom.

(Daniel 1:20) 
And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.

(Daniel 2:1) 
In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and his spirit was so troubled that he couldn't sleep.

(Daniel 2:2) 
So the king commanded all the magicians, sorcerers, enchanters, and astrologers to tell him his dream. And they all stood before the king.

(Daniel 2:3) 
The king told them, "I've had a dream, and I am troubled. I don't even know what it was."

(Daniel 2:4) 
The Chaldeans answered the king in the Aramaic language, "May the king live forever. Tell us the dream, your servants, and we will tell you the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:5) 
The king replied to the Chaldeans, "I have made a decision. If you don't tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn apart, and your houses will be demolished."

(Daniel 2:6) 
But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will receive rewards, gifts, and great honor from me. So tell me the dream and its interpretation."

(Daniel 2:7) 
They answered again, "Tell the dream to your servants, O king, and we will show you the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:8) 
The king replied, "I know you are trying to gain time, because you know that the thing has been decided by me."

(Daniel 2:9) 
If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one verdict for you. You have prepared lying and deceitful words to speak before me, until the situation changes. So tell me the dream, so that I can know that you can also tell me its true interpretation."

(Daniel 2:10) 
The Chaldeans responded to the king, saying, "There is not a man on earth who can tell the king this. The king demands something that is beyond human ability; there is no one else who can tell the king, except for the gods, and they do not live among humans."

(Daniel 2:11) 
Because of this, the king became furious and very angry and ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:12) 
When the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed, Daniel and his companions were sought so that they could also be executed.

(Daniel 2:13) 
Then Daniel, with his wisdom, responded to Arioch, the chief of the king's guards, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:14) 
And he asked, "Why did the king issue such a quick decree?" Arioch replied, "Because I have found some of the exiles from Judah who can tell the king the interpretation of the dream."

(Daniel 2:15) 
Daniel went in and asked the king for time to explain the interpretation to him.

(Daniel 2:16) 
Daniel then went to his companions and asked them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions would not be executed with the other wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:17) 
Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision in his dream. Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

(Daniel 2:18) 
Daniel responded, saying: "Blessed be the name of God from eternity to eternity because wisdom and power belong to Him."

(Daniel 2:19) 
He changes times and seasons; He deposes kings and establishes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who know mysteries.

(Daniel 2:20) 
He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what is in darkness, and the light dwells with Him.

(Daniel 2:21) 
I give thanks and praise to you, God of my ancestors, for You have given me wisdom and power. And now You have made known to me what we asked of You, for You have made known to us the king's message."

(Daniel 2:22) 
Therefore, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to kill the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not kill the wise men of Babylon. Bring me before the king, and I will show him the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:23) 
Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, "I have found a man of the exiles from Judah who will make known the interpretation to the king."

(Daniel 2:24) 
The king responded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Can you tell me the dream that I saw and its interpretation?"

(Daniel 2:25) 
Daniel answered the king, saying, "The mystery that the king is asking cannot be revealed to the king by wise men, magicians, enchanters, or astrologers."

(Daniel 2:26) 
But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. And He has made known to you, O king Nebuchadnezzar, what will happen in the last days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed are these:

(Daniel 2:27) 
As for you, O king, your thoughts came to your mind concerning what would happen after this, and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will happen.

(Daniel 2:28) 
As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have more wisdom than anyone else, but so that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.

(Daniel 2:29) 
You, O king, saw a great statue. That great statue, shining with extraordinary brilliance, stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying.

(Daniel 2:30) 
The head of the statue was made of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,

(Daniel 2:31) 
its legs of iron, and its feet, partly of iron and partly of clay.

(Daniel 2:32) 
You were looking on until a stone was cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands; and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.

(Daniel 2:33) 
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all crushed together and became like chaff on the summer threshing floor; the wind blew them away, so that no trace of them could be found.

(Daniel 2:34) 
But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

(Daniel 2:35) 
This is the dream; now we will tell the interpretation before the king.

(Daniel 2:36) 
You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the glory.

(Daniel 2:37) 
Wherever the children of humanity live, and the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has made you rule over all of them; you are the head of gold.

(Daniel 2:38) 
And after you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.

(Daniel 2:39) 
And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, for as iron breaks in pieces and crushes everything, so shall it break in pieces and crush all these.

(Daniel 2:40) 
And whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potters' clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with the clay of the potter.

(Daniel 2:41) 
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.

(Daniel 2:42) 
And as you saw iron mixed with clay, they will mingle with the seed of men, but they will not cleave to one another, even as iron cannot be mixed with clay.

(Daniel 2:43) 
And in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be given to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

(Daniel 2:44) 
Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the clay, the iron, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass after this; the dream is true, and the interpretation of it is faithful.

(Daniel 2:45) 
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and commanded that they should present to him sacrifices and incense.

(Daniel 2:46) 
The king answered Daniel, saying, "Truly, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this secret."

(Daniel 2:47) 
Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:48) 
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king's court.

(Daniel 3:1) 
King Nebuchadnezzar built a golden statue, sixty cubits tall and six cubits wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.

(Daniel 3:2) 
He then sent out word to summon the satraps, magistrates, judges, generals, nobles, prefects, and all the leaders of the provinces, so they would come to the dedication of the statue he had set up.

(Daniel 3:3) 
So the satraps, magistrates, judges, generals, nobles, prefects, and all the leaders of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They stood before the statue that he had placed there.

(Daniel 3:4) 
Then a herald proclaimed loudly: "People, nations, and language groups, you are commanded:

(Daniel 3:5) 
When you hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, and cithara, the sambuca, harp, and symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, you must immediately bow down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.

(Daniel 3:6) 
Whoever does not worship it will, at that moment, be thrown into a blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:7) 
Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, all the peoples, tribes, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

(Daniel 3:8) 
At that moment, certain Chaldeans came and accused the Jews.

(Daniel 3:9) 
They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!

(Daniel 3:10) 
You, O king, made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument must bow down and worship the golden statue,

(Daniel 3:11) 
and if anyone does not bow down and worship, he is to be thrown into a blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:12) 
But there are certain Jewish men, whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have disregarded your decree. They do not serve your gods, and they do not worship the golden statue that I have set up.”

(Daniel 3:13) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar, in fury and anger, commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. And they were immediately brought before the king.

(Daniel 3:14) 
King Nebuchadnezzar spoke to them and said, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods, and that you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up?

(Daniel 3:15) 
Now, therefore, if you are ready, whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, bow down and worship the statue that I have made. But if you do not worship, I do not know what god will rescue you from my hand.”

(Daniel 3:16) 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar, “We do not need to answer you about this matter.

(Daniel 3:17) 
Behold, our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the blazing furnace of fire, and to deliver us from your hand, O king.

(Daniel 3:18) 
But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue that you have set up.”

(Daniel 3:19) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the appearance of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered that the furnace be heated seven times more than it was usually heated.

(Daniel 3:20) 
He commanded certain strong men in his army to bind the feet of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:21) 
Then these men, bound with their tunics, trousers, hats, and other garments, were cast into the middle of the blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:22) 
Because the king’s command was urgent, the furnace was heated exceedingly hot. But the flames of the fire killed the men who had cast Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into it.

(Daniel 3:23) 
But these three men, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the middle of the blazing furnace of fire, bound.

(Daniel 3:24) 
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished, and he quickly rose and said to his nobles, “Did we not cast three men, bound, into the middle of the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “Truly, O king.”

(Daniel 3:25) 
He replied, “Look! I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm in them, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.”

(Daniel 3:26) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing furnace of fire and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire immediately.

(Daniel 3:27) 
And the satraps, magistrates, judges, and the king’s powerful men gathered to observe these men, and they saw that the fire had no power over their bodies. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their tunics were not damaged, and the smell of fire had not passed over them.

(Daniel 3:28) 
Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him. They defied the king’s word, and yielded their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.

(Daniel 3:29) 
Therefore, I have made a decree that any people, tribe, or language group that speaks against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses shall be made into a garbage heap. For there is no other god who can save in this way.”

(Daniel 3:30) 
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

(Daniel 4:1) 
From King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth: may peace be multiplied to you.

(Daniel 4:2) 
It seemed good to me to reveal the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.

(Daniel 4:3) 
How great are His signs, and how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His power is unto all generations.

(Daniel 4:4) 
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.

(Daniel 4:5) 
I saw a dream which terrified me; and my thoughts in my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.

(Daniel 4:6) 
Therefore, I issued a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of the Chaldeans, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.

(Daniel 4:7) 
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and I told the dream before them: but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.

(Daniel 4:8) 
But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and who has in him the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before him.

(Daniel 4:9) 
“Belteshazzar, prince of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that no secret is impossible to you, tell me the vision of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.

(Daniel 4:10) 
This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great.

(Daniel 4:11) 
The tree was great and strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof was to the ends of all the earth.

(Daniel 4:12) 
Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field dwelt under it, and the birds of the air inhabited in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.

(Daniel 4:13) 
I saw in the vision of my head in my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.

(Daniel 4:14) 
He cried aloud, and said thus: “Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts fly from under it, and the birds from its branches.

(Daniel 4:15) 
Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be bound with a band of iron and brass, among the grass, outside.

(Daniel 4:16) 
Let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the earth, till seven times pass over it.

(Daniel 4:17) 
This is the decree of the watchers, and the sentence of the holy ones, and the demand, that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men: and He will give it to whomever He will, and He will appoint the most humble of men over it.”

(Daniel 4:18) 
This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. You, therefore, Belteshazzar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom cannot tell me the interpretation; but you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

(Daniel 4:19) 
Then Belteshazzar, whose name is Belteshazzar, was greatly troubled for about an hour: and his thoughts disturbed him. The king answered and said: “Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said: “My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!

(Daniel 4:20) 
The tree that you saw, which was great and strong, whose height reached to heaven, whose sight was to the ends of the earth,

(Daniel 4:21) 
And its branches were beautiful, and its fruit exceedingly much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and the birds of the air built their nests, and all flesh was fed from it,

(Daniel 4:22) 
you, O king, are that tree, for you have grown and become strong, and your greatness has grown, and has reached to heaven, and your power to the ends of the whole earth.

(Daniel 4:23) 
And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, “Cut down the tree, and destroy it: but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be bound with a band of iron and brass, among the grass, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts, until seven times pass over it,”

(Daniel 4:24) 
this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which will come upon my lord the king:

(Daniel 4:25) 
They will cast you out from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts; you will eat grass like an ox, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will.

(Daniel 4:26) 
And whereas they commanded that the stump of the roots of the tree should be left in the earth: your kingdom will remain to you, and you will dwell in the earth with the beasts, and you will eat grass like an ox, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that God rules in the kingdom of men.

(Daniel 4:27) 
Therefore, O king, let my counsel please you: and redeem your sins by alms, and your iniquities with works of mercy for the poor: perhaps He will forgive your sins.

(Daniel 4:28) 
All these things came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.

(Daniel 4:29) 
At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the king of Babylon.

(Daniel 4:30) 
The king spoke, and said: “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the house of the kingdom, in the strength of my power, and in the glory of my splendor?”

(Daniel 4:31) 
While this word was still in the mouth of the king, a voice came down from heaven: “To you it is spoken, O king Nebuchadnezzar: The kingdom is departed from you.

(Daniel 4:32) 
And they will cast you out from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts; you will eat grass like an ox, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.”

(Daniel 4:33) 
In that very hour, the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was cast out from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hairs grew like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

(Daniel 4:34) 
Now at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven: and my understanding returned to me: and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified Him that lives forever: whose power is an everlasting power, and His kingdom is to generation and generation.

(Daniel 4:35) 
And all the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing before Him: because He does according to His will in the power of the heavens, and in the inhabitants of the earth: and there is no one who can resist His hand and say to Him: “Why have you done this?”

(Daniel 4:36) 
At that time, my understanding returned to me: and I returned to the honor of my kingdom, and to my beauty: and my glory was restored to me: and my ministers and my officers sought me, and I was established in my kingdom: and my greatness was added to me.

(Daniel 4:37) 
Now, therefore, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all His works are true, and His ways are judgments, and those who walk in pride He can humiliate.

(Daniel 5:1) 
King Baltassar held a huge banquet for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them.

(Daniel 5:2) 
Baltassar, fired up by the wine, ordered that the gold and silver vessels be brought in. His father Nabuchodonosor had taken these vessels from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines could drink from them.

(Daniel 5:3) 
So the gold and silver vessels, which had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem, were brought in. And the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.

(Daniel 5:4) 
They drank wine, and they praised their gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

(Daniel 5:5) 
In that very hour, the fingers of a man’s hand appeared, writing on the wall of the king’s palace. The king was watching the hand as it wrote.

(Daniel 5:6) 
Then the king’s face changed, and his thoughts disturbed him. His waist joints loosened, and his knees were knocking together.

(Daniel 5:7) 
The king cried out loudly that the magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers be brought in. He spoke to the wise men of Babylon, saying: “Whoever reads this writing and makes its interpretation known to me, he shall be clothed in purple, and shall have a gold chain on his neck, and he shall rule as the third in my kingdom.”

(Daniel 5:8) 
Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could neither read the writing nor explain its meaning to the king.

(Daniel 5:9) 
So King Baltassar was terrified, and his face was changed, and his nobles were also greatly disturbed.

(Daniel 5:10) 
The queen, because of the king’s words and those of his nobles, entered the banquet hall, and she said: “O king, live forever. Do not be terrified by your thoughts, and do not let your face change.”

(Daniel 5:11) 
There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods within him. In the days of your father, wisdom, understanding, and the knowledge of wisdom were found in him, according to the spirit of the gods. For King Nabuchodonosor, your father, appointed him as chief of the magicians, soothsayers, Chaldeans, and diviners,

(Daniel 5:12) 
because a greater spirit, knowledge, understanding, the interpretation of dreams, the revealing of secrets, and the solving of difficult questions were found in him. This is Daniel, whom the king named Baltassar. Now, therefore, let Daniel be called, and he will explain the meaning.”

(Daniel 5:13) 
Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him: “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought here from Judah?”

(Daniel 5:14) 
I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is within you, and that wisdom, understanding, and greater knowledge are found in you.

(Daniel 5:15) 
Now the wise men and the magicians have come before me to read this writing and to explain its meaning to me, but they could not explain the meaning of the message.

(Daniel 5:16) 
But I have heard about you that you can interpret obscure things and solve difficult questions. Therefore, if you can read this writing and explain its meaning to me, you shall be clothed in purple, and you shall have a gold chain around your neck, and you shall rule as the third in my kingdom.”

(Daniel 5:17) 
Then Daniel answered and said before the king: “Let your gifts be for you, and give your rewards to someone else, but I will read the writing to you, O king, and I will show you its interpretation.

(Daniel 5:18) 
O king, the Most High God gave Nabuchodonosor, your father, a kingdom, greatness, glory, and honor.

(Daniel 5:19) 
And because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, tribes, and languages trembled and feared him. Whoever he wanted, he killed; whoever he wanted, he struck down; whoever he wanted, he exalted; and whoever he wanted, he humbled.

(Daniel 5:20) 
But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit became hardened in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory was taken away.

(Daniel 5:21) 
He was driven away from the sons of men, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God has power over the kingdom of men and raises up over it whomever He wills.”

(Daniel 5:22) 
And you, his son Baltassar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,

(Daniel 5:23) 
but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels of His house were brought before you, and you, your nobles, your wives, and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which neither see nor hear nor know. But the God who holds your life in His hand and who directs all your ways, you did not glorify.

(Daniel 5:24) 
Therefore, the hand was sent from Him, and this writing was inscribed.

(Daniel 5:25) 
And this is the writing that was inscribed: “Mane, Thecel, Phares.”

(Daniel 5:26) 
And this is the interpretation of the word: “Mane” – God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end.

(Daniel 5:27) 
“Thecel” – You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.

(Daniel 5:28) 
“Phares” – Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

(Daniel 5:29) 
Then Baltassar gave the order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, and they put a gold chain around his neck, and they announced concerning him that he should have power as the third in his kingdom.

(Daniel 5:30) 
That very night, Baltassar the king of the Chaldeans was killed.

(Daniel 6:1) 
Darius decided to set up one hundred twenty governors, who were to be in charge of the whole kingdom;

(Daniel 6:2) 
and over them, three administrators, one of whom was Daniel, so that the governors would have to report to them, and the king would take no loss.

(Daniel 6:3) 
Daniel surpassed all of the administrators and governors because the Spirit of God was great within him.

(Daniel 6:4) 
The king was thinking of setting him up to have authority over the whole kingdom.

(Daniel 6:5) 
Therefore, the administrators and governors were looking for a reason to bring charges against Daniel concerning the business of the kingdom, but they were unable to find any fault or corruption in him, because he was faithful, and there was no fault or suspicion in him.

(Daniel 6:6) 
So these men said, “We will not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.”

(Daniel 6:7) 
So these administrators and governors rushed to the king and said to him, “King Darius, live forever!

(Daniel 6:8) 
All of the administrators of the kingdom, magistrates, and governors have agreed that the king should make a law that anyone who petitions any God or man for thirty days, except you, O king, should be cast into the pit of the lions.

(Daniel 6:9) 
Now, O king, confirm the decree and sign the prohibition, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians.”

(Daniel 6:10) 
Therefore King Darius made the decree and signed the prohibition.

(Daniel 6:11) 
But when Daniel learned that the decree had been written, he went into his house, and in his upper chamber, with his windows open, three times a day he was kneeling, praying, and giving thanks before his God, just as he had been accustomed to doing before.

(Daniel 6:12) 
Then those men, considering the situation, found Daniel praying and imploring his God.

(Daniel 6:13) 
And they came and spoke to the king about the decree. They said, “Did you establish a decree, O king, that every man who asks a petition of any God or man within thirty days, except you, O king, should be cast into the pit of the lions?”

(Daniel 6:14) 
The king answered and said, “The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not allowed to change.”

(Daniel 6:15) 
Then they answered and said before the king, “Daniel, who is from the sons of the captivity of Judah, has not cared about your law, O king, nor about the decree that you made, but three times a day he makes his supplications.”

(Daniel 6:16) 
When the king heard this, he was very sad, and he set his heart on freeing Daniel, and until sunset he worked to rescue him.

(Daniel 6:17) 
But those men, considering the matter before the king, said, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that every decree which the king establishes may not be changed.”

(Daniel 6:18) 
Then the king ordered, and Daniel was brought and cast into the pit of the lions. And the king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you always worship, Himself deliver you.”

(Daniel 6:19) 
Then a single stone was brought, and it was placed over the mouth of the pit, which the king sealed with his own ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that nothing should happen against Daniel.

(Daniel 6:20) 
Then the king went out to his palace, and he went to sleep without eating, and food was not brought before him, and also sleep departed from him.

(Daniel 6:21) 
Then the king, rising at dawn, went in haste to the pit of the lions.

(Daniel 6:22) 
And when he approached the pit, he cried out with a sorrowful voice to Daniel and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?”

(Daniel 6:23) 
Then Daniel, answering the king, said, “O king, live forever!

(Daniel 6:24) 
My God sent His angel and shut the mouths of the lions, and they did not harm me, because before Him justice was found in me, and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”

(Daniel 6:25) 
Then the king rejoiced over him, and he ordered Daniel to be brought up out of the pit, and Daniel was brought up out of the pit, and no injury was found in him because he had believed in his God.

(Daniel 6:26) 
And the king ordered, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought, and they were cast into the pit of lions, they, their children, and their wives, and before they reached the ground of the pit, the lions rushed upon them and crushed all of them.

(Daniel 6:27) 
Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, tribes, and languages dwelling in all the earth, “May your peace be multiplied.

(Daniel 6:28) 
I have made a decree that in all my kingdom they should tremble and fear the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, and He endures forever, and His kingdom is that which will not be corrupted, and His power endures to the end.

(Daniel 6:29) 
He is a deliverer and a savior, working signs and wonders in the universe and on the earth, who delivered Daniel from the pit of the lions.”

(Daniel 6:30) 
So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

(Daniel 7:1) 
In the first year of Belshazzar’s reign in Babylon, Daniel had a dream. Visions of his head came to him in his bed, and he recorded the dream. He summarized the events he had seen.

(Daniel 7:2) 
Daniel said: “In my vision that night, I saw that four powerful winds from the sky struck the great sea.

(Daniel 7:3) 
Then, four great beasts, each different from the others, arose from the sea.

(Daniel 7:4) 
The first beast was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked off. It was lifted up from the earth and set on its feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.

(Daniel 7:5) 
Then I saw another beast, a second one, that was like a bear. It was propped up on one side, and it had three rows of teeth in its mouth. They said to it, 'Arise! Eat much flesh!'

(Daniel 7:6) 
After this, I saw another beast, like a leopard, with wings like those of a bird on its back. The beast had four heads, and power was given to it.

(Daniel 7:7) 
After this I watched in my visions at night, and saw a fourth beast—fearsome, strong, and exceedingly powerful. It had great iron teeth. It ate and crushed, and it trampled down the rest with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts I had seen before it, and it had ten horns.

(Daniel 7:8) 
As I was considering the horns, I saw another horn, a small one, come up among them. Three of the first horns were uprooted before it. There were eyes like the eyes of a man on this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.

(Daniel 7:9) 
I watched until thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame; its wheels were a burning fire.

(Daniel 7:10) 
A stream of fire issued from before Him. Thousands upon thousands were ministering to Him, and myriads upon myriads were standing before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.

(Daniel 7:11) 
Then I kept watching, because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.

(Daniel 7:12) 
As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, and their lives were prolonged for a time and a season.

(Daniel 7:13) 
I kept watching in the night visions, and I saw one like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of the sky. He came up to the Ancient of Days and was brought before Him.

(Daniel 7:14) 
He was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom is one that shall not be destroyed.

(Daniel 7:15) 
I, Daniel, was deeply troubled in my spirit, and the visions of my head alarmed me.

(Daniel 7:16) 
I approached one of those standing by and asked him the truth about all this. So he told me, and explained the meaning of the words.

(Daniel 7:17) 
“These four great beasts are four kings, who will arise from the earth.

(Daniel 7:18) 
But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will possess the kingdom forever and ever.”

(Daniel 7:19) 
Then I wished to learn the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, which devoured, crushed, and trampled the remainder with its feet.

(Daniel 7:20) 
And I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and about the other horn which had arisen, before which three had fallen. This horn had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and its appearance was greater than the rest.

(Daniel 7:21) 
As I watched, that horn waged war against the holy ones and was prevailing over them,

(Daniel 7:22) 
until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High. The time came, and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.

(Daniel 7:23) 
So he said: “The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be greater than all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.

(Daniel 7:24) 
The ten horns are ten kings who will arise from this kingdom, and after them another will arise. This one will be more powerful than the former, and he will humble three kings.

(Daniel 7:25) 
He will speak against the Most High, and wear down the holy ones of the Most High, and will think to change the times and the laws. They will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.

(Daniel 7:26) 
But the judgment will sit, and his dominion will be taken away. It will be consumed and destroyed to the end.

(Daniel 7:27) 
Then the kingdom, dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under all the sky will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey Him.

(Daniel 7:28) 
This is the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was very troubled by my thoughts, and my face was changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.”

(Daniel 8:1) 
In the third year that king Baltassar reigned, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the things that I had seen in the beginning.

(Daniel 8:2) 
In the vision, I was in Susa, the capital of the province of Elam. And I saw the vision, and was standing near the gate of Ulai.

(Daniel 8:3) 
I raised my eyes, and there was a ram standing before the marsh. It had horns, but the horns were large. One horn was bigger than the other, and it rose up last.

(Daniel 8:4) 
I saw the ram butting with its horns toward the west, the north, and the south. No animals could stand against it, nor could they be saved from its power. It acted according to its will and grew strong.

(Daniel 8:5) 
I considered this, and suddenly, a male goat came from the west, crossing the whole earth. It did not touch the ground. Between its eyes was a prominent horn.

(Daniel 8:6) 
It advanced toward the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing near the marsh. The goat attacked it in a furious rage.

(Daniel 8:7) 
When it approached the ram, the goat became enraged and struck the ram, breaking its horns. The ram could not stand against it. The goat threw the ram to the ground and trampled it. There was no one who could save the ram from the goat's power.

(Daniel 8:8) 
The male goat swelled with pride, but at the peak of his strength, its large horn was broken. In its place, four other horns grew toward the four winds of the sky.

(Daniel 8:9) 
Out of one of them, a small horn came forth, growing strong toward the south, the east, and the promised land.

(Daniel 8:10) 
It became great, even up to the strength of the sky, and it cast down some of the stars and trampled them.

(Daniel 8:11) 
It even grew up to the Prince of the forces of the sky, and through it, the continual sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctification was overthrown.

(Daniel 8:12) 
Because of sin, the forces were given to it against the continual sacrifice. It cast the truth to the ground, and it acted, and it succeeded.

(Daniel 8:13) 
I heard one of the holy ones speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will this vision last, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of desolation? How long will the place of sanctification and the forces be trampled?

(Daniel 8:14) 
He answered, “It will last for two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, and then His sanctified place will be restored.”

(Daniel 8:15) 
When I, Daniel, saw the vision, I sought to understand it. Suddenly, a being like a man stood before me.

(Daniel 8:16) 
I heard a man's voice from the Ulai, who called out, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”

(Daniel 8:17) 
He came and stood near where I was. When he came, I was terrified and fell on my face. He said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”

(Daniel 8:18) 
As he spoke to me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. He touched me and set me in my place.

(Daniel 8:19) 
He said, “I will show you what will happen in the last days, because the vision concerns the time of the end.”

(Daniel 8:20) 
The ram that you saw, with the horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia.

(Daniel 8:21) 
The male goat represents the king of the Greeks, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.

(Daniel 8:22) 
That horn having been broken, and four others rising in its place, represents four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power.

(Daniel 8:23) 
In the last days of these kingdoms, when their iniquities are complete, there will arise a king of fierce appearance and skilled in intrigues.

(Daniel 8:24) 
His power will be great, and he will grow rich with wealth. He will rule with his strength and destroy all.

(Daniel 8:25) 
He will grow in strength in his heart, and through deceit, he will destroy many. He will rise against the Prince of princes, but he will be broken without human intervention.

(Daniel 8:26) 
The vision of the evening and the morning, which was spoken, is true. Therefore, you must seal up the vision, because it refers to many days from now.

(Daniel 8:27) 
I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick. After I saw the vision, there was no one to interpret it.

(Daniel 9:1) 
In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the line of the Medes, who ruled over the Chaldean kingdom:

(Daniel 9:2) 
In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, was reading the prophetic books. I understood the number of years that the Lord had told to the prophet Jeremiah—that Jerusalem would be desolate for seventy years.

(Daniel 9:3) 
And so I turned to God in prayer, fasting, and wearing sackcloth and ashes.

(Daniel 9:4) 
I prayed to the Lord, my God, and I confessed, saying: “O Lord God, great and awesome, you keep your covenant and show mercy to those who love you and keep your commandments:

(Daniel 9:5) 
We have sinned and committed iniquity. We have done evil and have rebelled. We have turned away from your commands and your judgments.

(Daniel 9:6) 
We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our leaders, our fathers, and all the people of the land.

(Daniel 9:7) 
To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness; but to us, shame, as at this day—to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all of Israel, both near and far, in all the countries to which you have driven them because of the transgressions with which they have sinned against you.

(Daniel 9:8) 
O Lord, to us belongs shame, to our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, who have sinned against you.

(Daniel 9:9) 
But to the Lord our God belongs mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him:

(Daniel 9:10) 
And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, by following his law, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

(Daniel 9:11) 
All of Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. So the curse and the oath that are written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against him.

(Daniel 9:12) 
And he has confirmed the words that he spoke against us and against our rulers, by bringing upon us a great evil. Never before under the whole universe has anything like what was done to Jerusalem been done.

(Daniel 9:13) 
As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the Lord our God, turning from our iniquities and understanding your truth.

(Daniel 9:14) 
Therefore the Lord has kept the evil in store and brought it upon us. For the Lord our God is righteous in all his works that he has done, because we did not obey his voice.

(Daniel 9:15) 
And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made for yourself a name, as at this day, we have sinned and done evil.

(Daniel 9:16) 
O Lord, in all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all those around us.

(Daniel 9:17) 
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant and his pleas, and for your own sake, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate.

(Daniel 9:18) 
O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.

(Daniel 9:19) 
O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention and act! Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your name has been called upon your city and your people.”

(Daniel 9:20) 
While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God,

(Daniel 9:21) 
while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice.

(Daniel 9:22) 
He made me understand, speaking to me, and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding.

(Daniel 9:23) 
At the beginning of your pleas, a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision.

(Daniel 9:24) 
Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.

(Daniel 9:25) 
Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks, it shall be built again with streets and trenches, even in times of distress.

(Daniel 9:26) 
And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end thereof shall be with a flood, and until the end of the war desolations are determined.

(Daniel 9:27) 
And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.”

(Daniel 10:1) 
In the third year of the reign of Cyrus, King of the Persians, God revealed His Word to Daniel, also known as Baltassar. This Word was true and important; Daniel understood the Word, and he had the insight of the vision.

(Daniel 10:2) 
During those days, I, Daniel, was in mourning for three weeks.

(Daniel 10:3) 
I did not eat any of the best foods. Neither meat nor wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself with oil, until the three weeks were finished.

(Daniel 10:4) 
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was beside the great river, which is the Tigris.

(Daniel 10:5) 
I raised my eyes, and I saw: and behold, a man dressed in linen. His waist was girded with the finest gold.

(Daniel 10:6) 
His body was like chrysolite. His face was like a flash of lightning, and his eyes were like a burning lamp. His arms and his feet had the appearance of gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.

(Daniel 10:7) 
I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it. But they were terrified by a great fear, and fled and hid themselves.

(Daniel 10:8) 
So I was left alone; I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me. My appearance was also changed in me, and I became weak, and I had no strength at all.

(Daniel 10:9) 
Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard them, I fell asleep, with my face on the ground.

(Daniel 10:10) 
Suddenly, a hand touched me, and raised me; and it set me in my place.

(Daniel 10:11) 
He said to me, “Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I am speaking to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” When he said this word to me, I stood trembling.

(Daniel 10:12) 
And he said to me: “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come because of your words.

(Daniel 10:13) 
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me for twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the first princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the king of Persia.

(Daniel 10:14) 
Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision is for many days yet.”

(Daniel 10:15) 
When he said these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was silent.

(Daniel 10:16) 
Then, behold, something like the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, because of your vision, I am terrified and am undone, and no strength remains in me.

(Daniel 10:17) 
For how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? For as for me, strength has immediately been taken from me, and my spirit has not remained in me.”

(Daniel 10:18) 
Again, the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me,

(Daniel 10:19) 
and said: “Do not fear, man of desires, peace be to you; be strong and of good courage.” And when he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said: “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.”

(Daniel 10:20) 
He said, “Do you know why I came to you? Now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come.

(Daniel 10:21) 
However, I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. There is no one to help me against these, except Michael, your prince.

(Daniel 11:1) 
I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, was set to be a support and help to him.

(Daniel 11:2) 
Now, I will announce the truth to you: behold, three more kings will rise up in Persia, and a fourth will be much richer than all the others; and when he gets power and wealth, he will stir up everything against the kingdom of Greece.

(Daniel 11:3) 
Then a strong king will rise, and he will rule with great power, and he will do whatever he pleases.

(Daniel 11:4) 
And when he has risen up, his kingdom will be broken, and it will be divided into the four winds of the sky; but not among his descendants, nor according to the power with which he ruled: for his kingdom will be uprooted, and given to others besides them.

(Daniel 11:5) 
The king of the south will become strong, and one of his princes will prevail over him, and will rule; and his dominion will be a powerful one.

(Daniel 11:6) 
And after years of alliance, the daughter of the king of the south will join the other, to make peace, but she will not have the strength of his arm, nor will she stand, nor will her seed; but she will be handed over, and those who brought her, and those who gave her birth, at this time.

(Daniel 11:7) 
And a shoot from the roots of her seed will rise up, and he will come with an army, and enter into the fortresses of the king of the north; and he will act against them, and prevail.

(Daniel 11:8) 
He will bring their gods, and their idols, and the precious vessels of silver and gold, with the captives, into Egypt; and he will prevail for years over the king of the north.

(Daniel 11:9) 
And the king of the north will enter into his kingdom, and return to his own land.

(Daniel 11:10) 
But his sons will wage war, and they will gather a great multitude; and it will come, rushing, and overflowing, and return, and wage war up to his fortresses.

(Daniel 11:11) 
And the king of the south will be stirred up, and he will go out and fight against the king of the north; and he will prepare a great multitude, and the multitude will be handed over into his hand.

(Daniel 11:12) 
And the multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down thousands: but he will not prevail.

(Daniel 11:13) 
For the king of the north will return, and prepare a greater multitude than before; and at the end of the times, he will come rushing, and overflow with a great army.

(Daniel 11:14) 
And in those times many will rise against the king of the south; also the children of the transgressors of your people will rise up to fulfill the vision, but they will fall.

(Daniel 11:15) 
And the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take fortified cities; and the arms of the south will not be able to hold out, and his chosen ones will not stand firm in their strength.

(Daniel 11:16) 
And he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and there will be no one who can resist him; and he will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand.

(Daniel 11:17) 
And he will set his face to come and seize the whole kingdom, and do it straightforwardly; and he will make a covenant with him; and he will give him the daughter of women, to destroy her; but she will not stand, nor will she be for him.

(Daniel 11:18) 
And he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many; and the commander of the disgrace will cease, and his disgrace will return.

(Daniel 11:19) 
And he will return to his own land, and will fall; and he will not be found.

(Daniel 11:20) 
And in his place will arise one of the disgrace, who will pass through the glory of the kingdom; and he will be broken in a few days, not in battle.

(Daniel 11:21) 
And in his place will arise a contemptible man, and the royal honor will not be given to him; and he will come secretly, and obtain the kingdom by deceit.

(Daniel 11:22) 
And the arms of the flood will flood before him, and they will be broken before him; and also the leader of the covenant.

(Daniel 11:23) 
And after his pact, he will act deceitfully, and will ascend, and will prevail in strength with a small hand.

(Daniel 11:24) 
He will enter into the richest parts of the provinces, and he will do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he will scatter spoils, and plunder, and wealth among them, and will devise his schemes against the fortified cities, for a time.

(Daniel 11:25) 
And he will stir up his forces, and his mind in great power against the king of the south; and this one will be provoked to war with great and very strong forces; but he will not stand, because they will devise schemes against him.

(Daniel 11:26) 
And those who eat his food will break him, and his army will be destroyed; and many will fall slain.

(Daniel 11:27) 
But the hearts of the two kings will be to do evil, and at one table they will speak a lie; but it will not succeed, because the end is still for the appointed day.

(Daniel 11:28) 
And he will return to his land with great wealth, and his heart will be against the holy covenant; and he will act and return to his land.

(Daniel 11:29) 
At the appointed time he will return, and come against the south; but it will not be as it was before, and afterwards.

(Daniel 11:30) 
And the ships of the Kittim will come against him, and he will be grieved, and will return; and he will be angry against the holy covenant, and he will act; and he will return, and consider those who have forsaken the holy covenant.

(Daniel 11:31) 
And arms will arise from him, and they will defile the sanctuary of strength, and take away the continual sacrifice, and set up the abomination that makes desolate.

(Daniel 11:32) 
And the wicked will act deceitfully against the covenant; but the people who know their God will be strong, and will act.

(Daniel 11:33) 
And those who have understanding among the people will instruct many; but they will fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by plunder, for a time.

(Daniel 11:34) 
And when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; and many will be joined to them deceitfully.

(Daniel 11:35) 
And some of the wise will fall, so that they may be tested, and purified, and made white, until the appointed time; because it still has a time.

(Daniel 11:36) 
And the king will act according to his own will; and he will exalt himself, and magnify himself against every god; and against the God of gods he will speak astonishing things, and will prosper until the wrath is completed; because the end is completed.

(Daniel 11:37) 
He will not regard the God of his fathers, nor will he look upon the desires of women, nor will he regard any god; for he will magnify himself against all things.

(Daniel 11:38) 
But in his place he will honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers did not know, he will honor with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and most precious things.

(Daniel 11:39) 
And he will act to fortify the fortresses of the mighty with a foreign god; and he will increase glory, and give them power over many, and divide the land for a price.

(Daniel 11:40) 
And at the appointed time, the king of the south will fight against him; and like a tempest, the king of the north will come against him with chariots, and horsemen, and many ships; and he will enter into the lands, and will subvert, and pass through.

(Daniel 11:41) 
And he will enter into the glorious land, and many will fall; but those who escape his hand will be saved, Edom, and Moab, and the chiefs of the children of Ammon.

(Daniel 11:42) 
And he will stretch out his hand against the lands, and the land of Egypt will not escape.

(Daniel 11:43) 
And he will have dominion over the treasures of gold, and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow his steps.

(Daniel 11:44) 
But messengers from the east and from the north will trouble him; and he will come with a great multitude to destroy and kill many.

(Daniel 11:45) 
And he will set his tabernacle between the seas, in the glorious and holy mountain; and he will come to its summit; but there will be no one to help him.

(Daniel 12:1) 
And at that time, the great Michael, a prince of the angels, will rise to defend your people. Then there will be a time of tribulation the likes of which the world has never seen before. But your people will be delivered, everyone written in the book of life.

(Daniel 12:2) 
And many who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will awaken: some to eternal life, but others will awaken to eternal punishment and disgrace.

(Daniel 12:3) 
Those who are wise will shine like the glory of the universe. And those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever.

(Daniel 12:4) 
But you, Daniel, keep the words secret, and seal the book until the appointed time. Many will travel the earth, and knowledge will increase.

(Daniel 12:5) 
Then I, Daniel, looked, and there stood two others: one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on the other side of the bank of the river.

(Daniel 12:6) 
And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was standing above the waters of the river, "How long will it be until the end of these wonders?"

(Daniel 12:7) 
I heard the man clothed in linen, who was standing above the waters of the river, raise his right hand toward the sky. He swore by Him who lives forever, that it would be a time, times, and half a time. And when the persecution of the holy people ends, all these things will be fulfilled.

(Daniel 12:8) 
And I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, "My Lord, what will be the end of these things?"

(Daniel 12:9) 
He answered, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the appointed time.

(Daniel 12:10) 
Purify yourselves, and make yourselves clean. Many will be refined, and tested, and purified. The wicked will continue to do wrong, and none of the wicked will understand. But those who are wise will understand.

(Daniel 12:11) 
From the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.

(Daniel 12:12) 
Blessed is the one who waits and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.

(Daniel 12:13) 
As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance at the end of days.

(Daniel 13:1) 
A man named Joachim lived in Babylon.

(Daniel 13:2) 
He took a wife named Susanna, the very beautiful daughter of Helcias, who was also a woman of deep faith.

(Daniel 13:3) 
Her parents were upright people and taught Susanna the law of Moses.

(Daniel 13:4) 
Now Joachim was wealthy, and his garden was next to his house. The Jews went to him because he was more respected than the others.

(Daniel 13:5) 
Two elders from the people were appointed as judges that year, of whom the Lord said: "Wickedness has come forth from Babylon from the elders who seemed to be ruling the people."

(Daniel 13:6) 
These elders were in Joachim's house, and all who had business came to them.

(Daniel 13:7) 
When Susanna left to walk in her husband's garden at midday,

(Daniel 13:8) 
the elders saw her enter and walk there. Driven by lust, their hearts burned for her.

(Daniel 13:9) 
They turned their gaze away.

(Daniel 13:10) 
After they withdrew, she entered the garden and walked there. It was hot, so she wanted to bathe in the garden.

(Daniel 13:11) 
There was a large container there. She opened it, wanting to bathe.

(Daniel 13:12) 
The two elders were hiding, watching her.

(Daniel 13:13) 
Susanna said, "Bring us oil and ointments, and close the doors of the garden so we can bathe."

(Daniel 13:14) 
They shouted, closed the doors of the garden, sent their servants away, and shut the doors.

(Daniel 13:15) 
When the servants had left, the two elders rose and rushed toward her.

(Daniel 13:16) 
They said to her, "The doors of the garden are closed, and no one sees us. We desire you; therefore, yield to us and be with us."

(Daniel 13:17) 
She said to them, "I will not do this. It is better for me to fall into your hands than to sin in the sight of the Lord."

(Daniel 13:18) 
So Susanna cried out in a loud voice, and the elders cried out against her.

(Daniel 13:19) 
Each of them ran off in his own direction.

(Daniel 13:20) 
One said to the other, "What is this that has happened?"

(Daniel 13:21) 
The elders returned and gathered against her, saying, "We caught Susanna, the daughter of Helcias and the wife of Joachim, walking in the garden with a young man, and we apprehended him. Since he refused to confess, we killed him."

(Daniel 13:22) 
They immediately said they had seen her with the young man, and this was their testimony.

(Daniel 13:23) 
In the morning, the assembly of the people was gathered, and the elders of the judges came with Susanna.

(Daniel 13:24) 
She was sent by her husband, her parents, and her servants. Susanna wept.

(Daniel 13:25) 
When she was in the sight of everyone, the elders said, "Send her away, and let us render judgment."

(Daniel 13:26) 
They said to her, "Tell us under what tree you caught them together."

(Daniel 13:27) 
She replied, "Under a mastic tree." And she said, "You have lied to your own detriment."

(Daniel 13:28) 
As they looked at each other, they said, "Tell us under what tree you caught them in conversation."

(Daniel 13:29) 
She said, "Under an holm oak." And she said, "You have lied, and you will not cease lying."

(Daniel 13:30) 
When all was said, everyone cried out and said, "Let her be killed!" Susanna cried out in a loud voice and wept because she was innocent.

(Daniel 13:31) 
Then Daniel stood up and said, "You sons of Israel are wicked, and you have rendered a false judgment against the daughter of Israel!"

(Daniel 13:32) 
All the people returned to him. He said, "You are foolish sons of Israel! Without judgment and without knowledge, have you condemned the daughter of Israel?"

(Daniel 13:33) 
Return to the judgment, for they have given false testimony against her."

(Daniel 13:34) 
Daniel, hastening, said, "Separate them, and let them not approach each other."

(Daniel 13:35) 
When they were separated, he called one of them and said to him, "O elder of wicked days, now your sins, which you committed before, have come to light,

(Daniel 13:36) 
judging false judgments, condemning the innocent, and acquitting the guilty, even though the Lord says, 'You shall not kill the innocent and the just.'"

(Daniel 13:37) 
Now then, if you saw her, tell us under what tree you saw them conversing together."

(Daniel 13:38) 
He replied, "Under an holm oak."

(Daniel 13:39) 
Then Daniel said, "You have lied to your own detriment! For behold, the angel of God, holding a sword, awaits you to destroy you."

(Daniel 13:40) 
And when he had removed him, he ordered the other to come. He said to him, "Seed of Canaan, not of Judah, a deceptive appearance, and let not error deceive you."

(Daniel 13:41) 
Why did you say you saw her walking with a young man, when you had lust for her?"

(Daniel 13:42) 
He replied, "Under a mastic tree."

(Daniel 13:43) 
Then Daniel said to him, "And you also have lied to your own detriment, for the angel of God awaits with a sword to cut you to pieces."

(Daniel 13:44) 
And the whole assembly cried out with a loud voice and blessed God, who saves those who hope in Him.

(Daniel 13:45) 
They rose against the two elders (because Daniel had convicted them of false testimony), and they did to them as they had wickedly planned.

(Daniel 13:46) 
They put them to death, and the innocent life was saved that day.

(Daniel 13:47) 
And Helcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, along with her husband Joachim, because no shameful thing had been found in her.

(Daniel 13:48) 
And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day forward.

(Daniel 14:1) 
And in the land was the prophet Habakkuk, and he took a meal of stew and a loaf of bread and carried it in a container to the harvesters in the field.

(Daniel 14:2) 
Now the dragon of Bel, as we were together, consumed all of the offerings that were given to him.

(Daniel 14:3) 
Therefore, Habakkuk said, “Lord, give me the stew and the bread, so I may give it to the harvesters.”

(Daniel 14:4) 
And an angel of the Lord grabbed Habakkuk by the hair of his head and carried him to Babylon, to the lion’s den, and with the force of his spirit, he placed him above the den.

(Daniel 14:5) 
Then Habakkuk spoke, “Habakkuk, give the meal to Habakkuk, whom you sent to Babylon.”

(Daniel 14:6) 
And Habakkuk gave Habakkuk the meal.

(Daniel 14:7) 
Bel and his priests, along with all the people, ate the offerings that were there.

(Daniel 14:8) 
But when they saw this, they cried out with a loud voice, “Great is Bel!”

(Daniel 14:9) 
But Daniel laughed and seized Bel, killing him and handing his priests over to Daniel’s power.

(Daniel 14:10) 
And he said, “Look, who is this? Do you see, Lord?”

(Daniel 14:11) 
And the king said: “Let them be brought before me, and I will determine who among them has done this.”

(Daniel 14:12) 
And when they were gathered and tested by the king, three hundred lying priests were found. He ordered them to be killed and gave Bel to Daniel’s power. And he destroyed him, and destroyed his temple.

(Daniel 14:13) 
In the same place was a great serpent, which the Babylonians worshipped.

(Daniel 14:14) 
And the king said to Daniel: “Do not say that this serpent is made of bronze? Look, it is alive; it eats and drinks; you cannot say that it is not a living god; therefore, adore him.”

(Daniel 14:15) 
And Daniel said, “I will worship my Lord God; because He is the living God; but this serpent is not a living God.”

(Daniel 14:16) 
Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair and cooked these things together; he made them into masses, and gave them to the serpent. The serpent burst.

(Daniel 14:17) 
And the Babylonians said, “King, because the serpent ate the offerings, Daniel killed the serpent.”

(Daniel 14:18) 
And when the king heard this, he was angry and handed Daniel over, and they gave him to the lions, and he remained there for six days.

(Daniel 14:19) 
And there were two prophets in Judea: one was Habakkuk, the other Daniel.

(Daniel 14:20) 
And the angel of the Lord took Habakkuk from Judea to Babylon and sent him into the lion’s den.

(Daniel 14:21) 
On the seventh day, the king came and saw Daniel sitting in the middle of the lions, and he worshiped and said, “You are great, Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you.”

(Daniel 14:22) 
And he brought him out of the lion’s den.

(Daniel 14:23) 
Now those who wanted to kill Daniel were given to the lions and were consumed immediately before them.

(Daniel 14:24) 
Then the king said, “Let all those who dwell in the entire land fear the God of Daniel, because He is the savior, performing signs and wonders on the earth.”
