(Ecclesiastes 1:1) 
These are the words of the Preacher, the son of David, the king of Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 1:2) 
“Meaningless, meaningless,” says the Preacher; “all things are meaningless.”

(Ecclesiastes 1:3) 
What is the benefit to any person for all his labor—labor that he does under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 1:4) 
One generation passes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains the same throughout time.

(Ecclesiastes 1:5) 
The sun rises and sets, returning to its place, and then, rising again,

(Ecclesiastes 1:6) 
it travels south, then turns north, always circling, always going back to its own circuits.

(Ecclesiastes 1:7) 
All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea does not become full. The rivers flow where they came from, so they can continue to flow.

(Ecclesiastes 1:8) 
All things are hard; no person can explain them with words.

(Ecclesiastes 1:9) 
The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear filled with hearing.

(Ecclesiastes 1:10) 
What has happened already? The same things that are going to happen again. What has been done before? The same things that will have to be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 1:11) 
If someone says, “Look, this is new!” it has already happened long ago in the ages before us.

(Ecclesiastes 1:12) 
There is no memory of what came before. Nor will those who come after remember what the first ones did, even in the very last generation.

(Ecclesiastes 1:13) 
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 1:14) 
And I set my heart to seek and examine wisely all the things that are done under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 1:15) 
God gave this bad occupation to the sons of men, so that they should be occupied with it.

(Ecclesiastes 1:16) 
I saw all the things that are done under the sun, and behold, all things are meaningless and a chasing after wind.

(Ecclesiastes 1:17) 
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and the number of fools is infinite.

(Ecclesiastes 1:18) 
I said in my heart, “I have become great, and I have increased in wisdom more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.” And my mind has contemplated much wisdom and knowledge.

(Ecclesiastes 1:19) 
I set my heart to know prudence, and also foolishness and folly: and I knew that this too was a chasing after wind,

(Ecclesiastes 1:20) 
because in much wisdom there is much anger, and he who increases knowledge, increases sorrow.

(Ecclesiastes 2:1) 
I told myself: “I will go and experience pleasure, and enjoy good things.” And I saw that this, too, was futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:2) 
I said of laughter: “It is madness!” and I said of joy: “What use is this?”

(Ecclesiastes 2:3) 
I pondered in my heart the way to cheer my body with wine, and how to sustain my mind with wisdom. I wanted to see what I should do under heaven during the few days of my life. I wanted to see what was good for humanity. I saw that this, too, was futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:4) 
I did great things: I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.

(Ecclesiastes 2:5) 
I made gardens and parks, and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:6) 
I created pools of water to irrigate the groves of young trees.

(Ecclesiastes 2:7) 
I had many servants and maids, and more possessions than anyone before me in Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 2:8) 
I gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself singers and musicians, and the delights of the sons of men: many of them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:9) 
So I became great, more so than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I always kept my wisdom.

(Ecclesiastes 2:10) 
And I did not deny my eyes anything they desired. I refused to restrain my heart from any pleasure. I was glad in all my labor. This was my reward.

(Ecclesiastes 2:11) 
I turned to consider all the works that my hands had accomplished, and the labor which I had toiled at. And behold, all was vanity and affliction of mind, and no profit under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 2:12) 
I then turned to consider wisdom, and madness, and folly. For what can a man do who comes after the king? What has he done already?

(Ecclesiastes 2:13) 
I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness.

(Ecclesiastes 2:14) 
The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. But I understood that one fate comes to both of them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:15) 
Then I said in my heart, “As the fool is, so am I.” Why then have I been so very wise? I then realized this was also futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:16) 
There is no permanent memory of the wise, and no lasting memory of the fool. In the coming days, all will be forgotten.

(Ecclesiastes 2:17) 
So I hated life, because all things done under the sun were grievous to me. For everything is vanity and an affliction of mind.

(Ecclesiastes 2:18) 
I hated all the fruit of my labor, which I had gained under the sun. I must leave it for the man who comes after me.

(Ecclesiastes 2:19) 
Who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will have control over all my labor in which I have toiled under the sun. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 2:20) 
So I began to despair of all my labor at which I had toiled under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 2:21) 
For there is a man who has labored with wisdom, and knowledge, and skill, but who must then give his portion to a man who did not labor for it. This also is vanity and great evil.

(Ecclesiastes 2:22) 
For what does a man get from all his labor and toil at which he toils under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 2:23) 
For all his days are full of grief, and his task is a source of sorrow. Even at night, his heart is not at rest. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 2:24) 
There is no good for a man but to eat, drink, and allow his soul to be happy in his labor. Then I saw that this also is from the hand of God.

(Ecclesiastes 2:25) 
Who indeed can eat, or who can rejoice, without Him?

(Ecclesiastes 2:26) 
To the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy. But to the sinner, God gives the task of gathering and collecting so that it can then be given to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and an affliction of the mind.

(Ecclesiastes 3:1) 
Everything happens at the right time, in its season, and there is a specific time for everything that happens under the sky.

(Ecclesiastes 3:2) 
There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what has been planted.

(Ecclesiastes 3:3) 
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to destroy, and a time to build up.

(Ecclesiastes 3:4) 
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.

(Ecclesiastes 3:5) 
A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.

(Ecclesiastes 3:6) 
A time to gain, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away.

(Ecclesiastes 3:7) 
A time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak.

(Ecclesiastes 3:8) 
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.

(Ecclesiastes 3:9) 
What does the worker gain from his toil?

(Ecclesiastes 3:10) 
I have seen the burden that God has given the children of men to be afflicted in it.

(Ecclesiastes 3:11) 
He has made everything beautiful in its time, and He has put eternity into their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God has done from the beginning to the end.

(Ecclesiastes 3:12) 
I have known that there is no better thing for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their life.

(Ecclesiastes 3:13) 
Also, that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—this is the gift of God.

(Ecclesiastes 3:14) 
I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. And this God does, so that men should fear Him.

(Ecclesiastes 3:15) 
That which has been is already, and that which is to be has already been. And God restores what has passed.

(Ecclesiastes 3:16) 
And moreover, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment, where wickedness was, and the place of righteousness, where wickedness was.

(Ecclesiastes 3:17) 
And I said in my heart, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked.” For there is a time for every matter, and for every work.

(Ecclesiastes 3:18) 
I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would test them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.

(Ecclesiastes 3:19) 
For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same: As one dies, so dies the other; and all have the same breath. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 3:20) 
All go to one place; all came from the dust, and all return to the dust.

(Ecclesiastes 3:21) 
Who knows whether the spirit of the sons of men ascends upward, and the spirit of the beasts descends downward to the earth?

(Ecclesiastes 3:22) 
So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what will be after him?

(Ecclesiastes 4:1) 
I then returned and saw all the oppression going on in the world. I observed the tears of the innocent, and there was no one to comfort them. They were being violently attacked by those in power, but there was no one to help them.

(Ecclesiastes 4:2) 
I consider those who have died to be more blessed than those who are still alive.

(Ecclesiastes 4:3) 
I even felt that it would be better not to have been born at all, so that one wouldn't see the evil that goes on in the world.

(Ecclesiastes 4:4) 
I noticed that all the hard work done by humans is fueled by envy of others.

(Ecclesiastes 4:5) 
This is vanity, a chasing after the wind, as the envious person tries to satisfy his own greed.

(Ecclesiastes 4:6) 
It is better to be satisfied with one handful of possessions than two handfuls, if you are working to gain those things with anxieties of the spirit.

(Ecclesiastes 4:7) 
This, too, is vanity and a striving after the wind.

(Ecclesiastes 4:8) 
There is also the case of the solitary man, who has no companion, no son or brother, and yet his work never ends, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches. He never thinks, "For whom am I working, and depriving myself of pleasure?"

(Ecclesiastes 4:9) 
This, too, is vanity, and a miserable business.

(Ecclesiastes 4:10) 
Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.

(Ecclesiastes 4:11) 
If either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But pity the person who falls and has no one to help him up.

(Ecclesiastes 4:12) 
Also, if two lie down, they will keep each other warm. But how can one person be warm alone?

(Ecclesiastes 4:13) 
Though one is overpowered, two can defend themselves. A three-ply cord is not easily broken.

(Ecclesiastes 4:14) 
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to heed warnings.

(Ecclesiastes 4:15) 
For even when the king was formerly imprisoned, he could come to power, and then another poor person could be born into the kingdom.

(Ecclesiastes 4:16) 
I considered all the living who are walking under the sun, and I was struck by the fact that the next young man will soon take over the kingdom.

(Ecclesiastes 4:17) 
There is no end to all those who preceded him, and those who come after will not rejoice in him. This, too, is vanity and striving after the wind.

(Ecclesiastes 5:1) 
Be careful when you go to the house of God. Give more heed to the Word of God than to the words of foolish men, lest you make a sacrifice to the folly of men.

(Ecclesiastes 5:2) 
Don’t speak rashly. Don’t let your heart be too quick to utter a word before God. God is in the universe, and you are upon the earth, so let your words be few.

(Ecclesiastes 5:3) 
For sleep comes with many activities, and the fool is recognized in much speech.

(Ecclesiastes 5:4) 
When you vow a vow to God, don’t delay to pay it, for God hates a foolish and unreliable promise. Whatever you vow, pay it.

(Ecclesiastes 5:5) 
It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.

(Ecclesiastes 5:6) 
Don’t let your mouth cause you to sin, and don’t say before an angel, “It was a mistake.” Don't let God, angry at your words, destroy the works of your hands.

(Ecclesiastes 5:7) 
When there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and many words. But you, fear God.

(Ecclesiastes 5:8) 
If you see the poor oppressed and justice and righteousness violently taken away in a judgment, don’t be surprised at this situation, because the highest is greater than the others, and there are higher ones than them, and still others higher than those.

(Ecclesiastes 5:9) 
Moreover, the advantage of the land is for all. Even a king depends on the harvest.

(Ecclesiastes 5:10) 
The one who loves money will not be satisfied with money. Whoever loves riches will get no fruit from them, and this too is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 5:11) 
When goods increase, so do those who consume them. So what advantage is there to the possessor except to see them with his eyes?

(Ecclesiastes 5:12) 
Sweet is the sleep of the worker, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich does not allow him to sleep.

(Ecclesiastes 5:13) 
There is also another most grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches preserved for the harm of their owners.

(Ecclesiastes 5:14) 
For riches are destroyed in evil circumstances, and when they beget a son, he comes to nothing.

(Ecclesiastes 5:15) 
As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return naked, and will take nothing for his labor that he can carry in his hand.

(Ecclesiastes 5:16) 
This is also a most grievous evil: that he departs in the same way that he came. What advantage then is it to him that he has labored for the wind?

(Ecclesiastes 5:17) 
All his days he eats in darkness, with much sorrow, and indignation, and grief.

(Ecclesiastes 5:18) 
Behold, what I have seen to be good and beautiful is to eat and drink and enjoy the good of one’s labor under the sun during the number of days of his life that God has given him, for this is his portion.

(Ecclesiastes 5:19) 
For everyone to whom God gives riches and possessions and grants the power to eat of them, to receive his portion, and to rejoice in his labor, this is a gift of God.

(Ecclesiastes 5:20) 
For he will not often remember the days of his life, because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.

(Ecclesiastes 6:1) 
Here's another problem I see happening among mankind:

(Ecclesiastes 6:2) 
A man to whom God gives wealth, property, and honor, and who lacks nothing of all he desires, but God doesn't let him enjoy any of it. Instead, a stranger consumes it. This is vanity and great suffering.

(Ecclesiastes 6:3) 
If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, and accumulates many days of life, but his soul is not satisfied with good things, and he gets no proper burial, then I declare that an infant who died before birth is better off than he is.

(Ecclesiastes 6:4) 
The stillborn comes in vain, and goes into darkness, and his name is covered in shadows.

(Ecclesiastes 6:5) 
He never saw the sun, nor knew the difference between good and evil.

(Ecclesiastes 6:6) 
Even if he lived two thousand years, yet did not enjoy good things, wouldn't everything be heading to the same place?

(Ecclesiastes 6:7) 
All human labor is for his mouth, but his soul is never filled.

(Ecclesiastes 6:8) 
So, what does the wise man have more than the fool? And what does the poor man gain by living?

(Ecclesiastes 6:9) 
It is better to enjoy what you see than to give in to desire. But this too is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 6:10) 
Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known that man cannot fight against what is stronger than he is.

(Ecclesiastes 6:11) 
There are many things that multiply vanity; what does man have more than vanity?

(Ecclesiastes 6:12) 
For who knows what is good for man during his lifetime of vanity, which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 7:1) 
A good reputation is better than expensive perfume, and the day of death is better than the day of birth.

(Ecclesiastes 7:2) 
It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting: because there we can contemplate the end of all things, and the living can remember what is to come.

(Ecclesiastes 7:3) 
Sorrow is better than laughter, because through sorrow, the mind can be corrected.

(Ecclesiastes 7:4) 
The wise have sorrow in their heart, but the fools have only the foolishness of laughter.

(Ecclesiastes 7:5) 
It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise than to the song of fools.

(Ecclesiastes 7:6) 
For as the sound of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: and this also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 7:7) 
Oppression makes the wise man foolish, and it destroys the strength of his heart.

(Ecclesiastes 7:8) 
The end of a matter is better than its beginning. It is better to be patient than to be proud.

(Ecclesiastes 7:9) 
Do not be quick to anger, for anger rests in the bosom of a fool.

(Ecclesiastes 7:10) 
Do not say: “Why do you think that the life of the past was better than this?” because that is a foolish question.

(Ecclesiastes 7:11) 
Wisdom is good with riches, and those who live under the light find benefit.

(Ecclesiastes 7:12) 
For under the shadow of wisdom and under the shadow of wealth, there is protection: but the knowledge of wisdom protects its owner.

(Ecclesiastes 7:13) 
Consider the works of God, for no one can correct what He has rejected.

(Ecclesiastes 7:14) 
On a good day, enjoy good things, and in the day of evil, consider: God made one against the other, so that man may not find anything against himself.

(Ecclesiastes 7:15) 
I have seen everything in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his justice, and there is a wicked man who lives a long time in his wickedness.

(Ecclesiastes 7:16) 
Do not be overly just, nor become wiser than necessary, lest you be astonished.

(Ecclesiastes 7:17) 
Do not be excessively wicked, nor become foolish. Why will you die before your time?

(Ecclesiastes 7:18) 
It is good to restrain yourself in these things and not withdraw your hand from them: for he who fears God keeps all the commandments.

(Ecclesiastes 7:19) 
Wisdom is stronger than seven powerful men who rule a city.

(Ecclesiastes 7:20) 
For there is scarcely any just man on earth, who does good and does not sin.

(Ecclesiastes 7:21) 
Do not take to heart all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.

(Ecclesiastes 7:22) 
For your heart often knows that many others have cursed you.

(Ecclesiastes 7:23) 
All these things I have tested in wisdom: I said, “I will be wise,” but it went far from me.

(Ecclesiastes 7:24) 
It was further away than it had been, and more profound. Who can find it?

(Ecclesiastes 7:25) 
I went around everything in my heart, so that I might know and consider and seek wisdom and reason, and so that I might know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:

(Ecclesiastes 7:26) 
And I found a woman more bitter than death, who is the snare of the heart, and a snare of the hunters: he who pleases God will escape her: but he who is a sinner will be caught by her.

(Ecclesiastes 7:27) 
Behold, this I have found, says Ecclesiastes, one after another to find reason.

(Ecclesiastes 7:28) 
Which my soul still seeks, and has not found: among a thousand men I found one, but among all women I did not find one.

(Ecclesiastes 7:29) 
This only have I found, that God made man upright, but he himself entangled himself in endless questions.

(Ecclesiastes 8:1) 
Who is like the wise man, and who understands the meaning of a word? A man's wisdom illuminates his face, and his face is changed.

(Ecclesiastes 8:2) 
I am instructed by the king and I obey the rules that God created.

(Ecclesiastes 8:3) 
Do not be in a hurry to leave his presence, and do not persist in evil.

(Ecclesiastes 8:4) 
Because he will do whatever he wants, and where the king's word is, there is power.

(Ecclesiastes 8:5) 
Anyone who obeys a command will not feel anything bad. The wise heart knows the proper timing.

(Ecclesiastes 8:6) 
Every matter has its own time and mode, and a lot of evil oppresses a man.

(Ecclesiastes 8:7) 
Because he does not know what will happen: and who will tell him the future?

(Ecclesiastes 8:8) 
A man does not have power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, nor power on the day of his death. He cannot win an evil conflict, nor can he save the one who is impious.

(Ecclesiastes 8:9) 
All of these things I have observed, and I have given my heart to all the works which are done under the sun, when a man rules over another man to his evil.

(Ecclesiastes 8:10) 
Then I saw the wicked buried, and those who worked in the holy place: and they were praised in the city for what they had done. And this is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 8:11) 
Because the sentence against the wicked is not quickly pronounced, therefore the children of men are full of evil hearts.

(Ecclesiastes 8:12) 
Even if the impious sins a hundred times, and God seems to have prolonged his life, I know that it will be good for those who fear God, who revere His face.

(Ecclesiastes 8:13) 
But it will not be good for the wicked man, nor will he prolong his shadow, as the shadow of a tree.

(Ecclesiastes 8:14) 
There is a vanity which occurs on the earth: there are just men to whom evils happen, as if they were the works of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom good things happen, as if they were the works of the just. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 8:15) 
I therefore praised joy, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink, and to be joyful, and that this should accompany him in his labor, during the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 8:16) 
I set my heart to know wisdom, and to see the activity which is carried on in the earth: because my eyes do not take sleep, day or night.

(Ecclesiastes 8:17) 
And I understood that all the works of God are, and a man cannot find the work that is done under the sun, and the more a man labors to seek, the less he will find.

(Ecclesiastes 8:18) 
Again I applied my heart to know wisdom, and foolishness and imprudence. And I knew that this was vanity too:

(Ecclesiastes 8:19) 
Because in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and whoever increases knowledge increases pain.

(Ecclesiastes 9:1) 
I considered all these things within my heart, so that I could investigate them, and see that the righteous, the wise, and their works are in God's hand. Yet, humanity doesn’t know if they are worthy of love or hate.

(Ecclesiastes 9:2) 
But one thing is certain, that all things come to the same end, because one fate befalls the righteous and the wicked, the good and the evil, the clean and the unclean, the one who sacrifices and the one who rejects sacrifice.

(Ecclesiastes 9:3) 
Because of this, I think it is absurd that the same death awaits the just and the unjust; the good and the bad both die.

(Ecclesiastes 9:4) 
Therefore, it is better for people to rejoice in their work, for this is their portion. Who can bring them back to know what is yet to come?

(Ecclesiastes 9:5) 
Do everything that you can do in life, because neither work, nor reason, nor knowledge, nor wisdom will be in the grave, where you are hastening.

(Ecclesiastes 9:6) 
I turned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the war to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor grace to the educated, nor riches to the skilled; but time and chance happen to them all.

(Ecclesiastes 9:7) 
Humanity doesn’t know its end; but as fish are caught with a hook, and as birds are caught in a snare, so humans are trapped in evil times when it suddenly comes upon them.

(Ecclesiastes 9:8) 
This, too, I have seen is wisdom, and is a great thing under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 9:9) 
There was a small city with few men in it; a great king came against it and surrounded it and built fortifications around it to attack it.

(Ecclesiastes 9:10) 
A poor and wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city through his wisdom, but no one remembered that poor man afterwards.

(Ecclesiastes 9:11) 
And I said wisdom is better than strength; and how the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.

(Ecclesiastes 9:12) 
The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the clamor of a prince among fools.

(Ecclesiastes 9:13) 
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one who sins destroys many good things.

(Ecclesiastes 9:14) 
A dead fly spoils the sweet scent of the ointment. Glory and wisdom are despised, and a little brief hunger is more than foolishness and stupidity.

(Ecclesiastes 9:15) 
The words of the wise are gracious; the lips of a fool are his own destruction.

(Ecclesiastes 9:16) 
Blessed are you, land, whose king is a boy, and whose princes eat in the morning.

(Ecclesiastes 9:17) 
Blessed are you, land, whose king is noble and whose princes eat in due time, for food and not in luxury.

(Ecclesiastes 9:18) 
Through laziness, the building decays; through the idleness of hands, the house drips.

(Ecclesiastes 9:19) 
Men make a feast for laughter, and wine makes the living happy; and money answers everything.

(Ecclesiastes 9:20) 
Do not curse the king, nor in your heart curse the rich; do not curse the birds of the sky, because even the birds of the sky will carry the word, and the one who has wings will announce the judgment.

(Ecclesiastes 10:1) 
A dead fly ruins the value of perfumed oil, and wisdom and glory are more honorable than the foolishness of a little while.

(Ecclesiastes 10:2) 
The heart of the wise man is on the right, and the heart of the fool is on the left.

(Ecclesiastes 10:3) 
Even when the fool walks on the road, he thinks everyone else is a fool.

(Ecclesiastes 10:4) 
If the authority of a ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; because submission makes even great sins stop.

(Ecclesiastes 10:5) 
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, something that seems to come by accident from the presence of the ruler:

(Ecclesiastes 10:6) 
A fool is placed in high office, while rich men are seated below.

(Ecclesiastes 10:7) 
I have seen servants riding on horses, and princes walking like servants on the ground.

(Ecclesiastes 10:8) 
The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.

(Ecclesiastes 10:9) 
The one who moves stones will be hurt by them, and the one who splits wood will be in danger from it.

(Ecclesiastes 10:10) 
If the iron is blunt, and this is not sharp, but blunted, great effort is needed: and after hard work, wisdom will offer aid.

(Ecclesiastes 10:11) 
If a serpent bites in silence, the whisperer is no less dangerous; he who secretly slanders, destroys his own soul.

(Ecclesiastes 10:12) 
The words of the wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of the fool swallow him.

(Ecclesiastes 10:13) 
The beginning of his mouth’s words is foolishness, and the beginning of his mouth is the worst madness.

(Ecclesiastes 10:14) 
The fool multiplies words.

(Ecclesiastes 10:15) 
The ignorant man doesn't know what will happen, and who will tell him what will be after him?

(Ecclesiastes 10:16) 
Woe to you, O land, whose king is a child, and whose leaders eat in the morning.

(Ecclesiastes 10:17) 
Blessed is the land whose king is noble, and whose leaders eat at the right time, for strength, and not for excess.

(Ecclesiastes 10:18) 
Through laziness the roof will fall in, and through idleness the house will decay.

(Ecclesiastes 10:19) 
Feasting provides bread, and wine cheers the living, but money answers all things.

(Ecclesiastes 10:20) 
Also, do not curse the king even in your thought, and do not curse the rich in your private chamber: for the birds of the sky will carry your voice, and the one with wings will report the word.

(Ecclesiastes 11:1) 
Cast your bread upon the water, for in time you will find it.

(Ecclesiastes 11:2) 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for you do not know what evil will come upon the earth.

(Ecclesiastes 11:3) 
If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth. If a tree falls towards the south or the north, it will stay where it fell.

(Ecclesiastes 11:4) 
Whoever watches the wind will not sow, and whoever observes the clouds will never reap.

(Ecclesiastes 11:5) 
Just as you do not know the way of the spirit, or how bones are formed in the womb of a pregnant woman: so you do not know the work of God, who works everything.

(Ecclesiastes 11:6) 
Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters: for after many days you will find it.

(Ecclesiastes 11:7) 
Give a portion to seven, and even to eight: for you do not know what evil will be upon the earth.

(Ecclesiastes 11:8) 
If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth: and if a tree falls towards the north or the south, it will remain where it fell.

(Ecclesiastes 11:9) 
Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: and know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.

(Ecclesiastes 11:10) 
Remove anger from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh. For youth and pleasure are vain.

(Ecclesiastes 12:1) 
Remember your Creator in your youth, before the days of trial come, and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them."

(Ecclesiastes 12:2) 
Before the sun and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:

(Ecclesiastes 12:3) 
When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders be dark in the windows,

(Ecclesiastes 12:4) 
And the door shall be shut in the street, when the voice of the grinder is low, and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low.

(Ecclesiastes 12:5) 
And they shall be afraid of the high places, and they shall be afraid in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall be made fat, and the caper fruit shall be scattered: because man goeth into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall go about in the street.

(Ecclesiastes 12:6) 
Before the silver cord be broken, and the golden fillet be broken, and the pitcher be broken over the fountain, and the wheel be broken over the cistern,

(Ecclesiastes 12:7) 
And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.

(Ecclesiastes 12:8) 
Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, and all things are vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 12:9) 
And whereas the Preacher was wise, he taught the people, and declared what he had done, and composed many parables.

(Ecclesiastes 12:10) 
He sought to find profitable words, and to write truth, and to write truth of words.

(Ecclesiastes 12:11) 
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails driven into the depths, which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd.

(Ecclesiastes 12:12) 
And more than these, my son, be thou warned: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.

(Ecclesiastes 12:13) 
Let us all hear together the end of the discourse: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is all man.

(Ecclesiastes 12:14) 
For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

(Song of Solomon 1:1) 
Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: Because your affections are better than wine,

(Song of Solomon 1:2) 
And the fragrance of your perfumes. Your name is good, like oil poured out, therefore the young girls love you.

(Song of Solomon 1:3) 
Draw me to you, and we will follow you. You will guide us by your affection. The king brought me into his wine cellar. We will be glad and rejoice in you, remembering your affections better than wine.

(Song of Solomon 1:4) 
You will find great favor and love in them.

(Song of Solomon 1:5) 
I am dark, but beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

(Song of Solomon 1:6) 
Don't look down on me because I am dark, because the sun has darkened my skin. My mother's sons were angry with me, and forced me to be a keeper of the vineyards, but I did not watch over my own vineyard.

(Song of Solomon 1:7) 
Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you feed your flock, where you rest at noon, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of your companions.

(Song of Solomon 1:8) 
If you do not know, fairest among women, go forth, and follow the footsteps of the flock, and feed your kids near the tents of the shepherds.

(Song of Solomon 1:9) 
To my team of horses in Pharaoh's chariots, I have brought you, my love.

(Song of Solomon 1:10) 
Your cheeks are as beautiful as a dove, your neck like jewels.

(Song of Solomon 1:11) 
We will make you gold ornaments, and decorate them with silver.

(Song of Solomon 1:12) 
While the king was reclining, my nard gave its fragrance.

(Song of Solomon 1:13) 
My beloved is a bundle of myrrh to me: it shall lie between my breasts.

(Song of Solomon 1:14) 
My beloved is a cluster of cypress to me in the vineyards of Engaddi.

(Song of Solomon 1:15) 
Behold, you are beautiful, my love, behold, you are beautiful: your eyes are like doves.

(Song of Solomon 1:16) 
Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, and delightful: our bed is blooming.

(Song of Solomon 1:17) 
The covering of our houses is cedar, and our ceilings are cypress.

(Song of Solomon 2:1) 
I am like a flower in the field, and a lily of the valleys.

(Song of Solomon 2:2) 
As the lily is among the thorns, so is my beloved among the daughters.

(Song of Solomon 2:3) 
As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons.

(Song of Solomon 2:4) 
I have desired to sit under His shadow, and His fruit is sweet to my throat.

(Song of Solomon 2:5) 
He brought me into the wine cellar, and He established charity in me.

(Song of Solomon 2:6) 
Strengthen me with flowers, surround me with apples, because I languish with love.

(Song of Solomon 2:7) 
His left hand is under my head, and His right hand will embrace me.

(Song of Solomon 2:8) 
I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and the hinds of the fields, that you do not rouse, nor awaken my beloved, until she herself wishes.

(Song of Solomon 2:9) 
The voice of my beloved! Behold, this one comes, leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.

(Song of Solomon 2:10) 
My beloved is like a gazelle, or a young hart. Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.

(Song of Solomon 2:11) 
Behold my beloved speaks to me: “Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.”

(Song of Solomon 2:12) 
For now the winter is past, the rain is gone and departed.

(Song of Solomon 2:13) 
The flowers have appeared in the land, the time of pruning has come.

(Song of Solomon 2:14) 
The voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

(Song of Solomon 2:15) 
The fig tree has produced its green figs: the vines in bloom have given their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come.

(Song of Solomon 2:16) 
My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me your face, let your voice sound in my ears: for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful.

(Song of Solomon 2:17) 
Catch the little foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines have flourished.

(Song of Solomon 2:18) 
My beloved is for me, and I am for Him, who feeds among the lilies.

(Song of Solomon 3:1) 
I went to my bed in the night, seeking the one whom my soul loves: I sought him, and I did not find him.

(Song of Solomon 3:2) 
I will get up, and I will go around the city: through the streets and the squares, I will seek the one whom my soul loves. I sought him, and I did not find him.

(Song of Solomon 3:3) 
The watchmen found me, those who guard the city: “Have you seen the one whom my soul loves?”

(Song of Solomon 3:4) 
A little further on, I found the one whom my soul loves: I held him, and I will not let him go until I bring him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who bore me.

(Song of Solomon 3:5) 
I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and the hinds of the fields, that you not stir up, nor awake the beloved, until she desires it.

(Song of Solomon 3:6) 
Who is this, ascending through the desert like a column of smoke from the perfumes of myrrh, and frankincense, and every powder of the perfumer?

(Song of Solomon 3:7) 
Behold, the bed of Solomon: sixty strong men surround it, of the strongest of Israel.

(Song of Solomon 3:8) 
All holding swords, and warriors, each man has his sword upon his thigh, because of the fear of the night.

(Song of Solomon 3:9) 
King Solomon made himself a bed, from the wood of Lebanon.

(Song of Solomon 3:10) 
He made its columns of silver: the support of gold, the ascent of purple; he paved the middle with charity, on account of the daughters of Jerusalem.

(Song of Solomon 3:11) 
Go out, and see the daughters of Zion, in the bed where his mother comforted him, where she bore him.

(Song of Solomon 4:1) 
How beautiful you are, my love! How beautiful you are! Your eyes are like doves, hidden from those who would do you harm.

(Song of Solomon 4:2) 
Your hair is like a flock of goats that descends from Mount Gilead.

(Song of Solomon 4:3) 
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that has come up from washing, all of which are twin, and there is no barren one among them.

(Song of Solomon 4:4) 
Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate, hidden from those who would do you harm.

(Song of Solomon 4:5) 
Your neck is like the tower of David, built with ramparts: a thousand shields hang from it, all the armor of the strong.

(Song of Solomon 4:6) 
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, which graze among the lilies.

(Song of Solomon 4:7) 
Until the day breathes, and the shadows decline, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of incense.

(Song of Solomon 4:8) 
You are entirely beautiful, my love; there is no stain in you.

(Song of Solomon 4:9) 
Come from Lebanon, my spouse, come from Lebanon, come and descend; you will be crowned from the head of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.

(Song of Solomon 4:10) 
You have wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have wounded my heart with one look of your eyes, and with one strand of hair on your neck.

(Song of Solomon 4:11) 
How beautiful are your breasts, my sister, my spouse! Your breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the fragrance of your perfumes is above all spices.

(Song of Solomon 4:12) 
Your lips, my spouse, drip like honey; milk and honey are under your tongue: and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of incense.

(Song of Solomon 4:13) 
A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.

(Song of Solomon 4:14) 
Your plants are a paradise of pomegranates with fruit; the cypress is with spikenard.

(Song of Solomon 4:15) 
Spikenard and saffron, cinnamon and calamus, with all the trees of Lebanon; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief perfumes.

(Song of Solomon 4:16) 
Awake, north wind, and come, south wind; blow upon my garden, and let its spices flow. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his choice fruits.

(Song of Solomon 5:1) 
I came to my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; and be inebriated, dearest ones.

(Song of Solomon 5:2) 
I sleep, but my heart stays awake. Listen! The voice of my beloved, knocking! Open to me, my sister, my friend, my dove, my spotless one: for my head is full of dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

(Song of Solomon 5:3) 
I have taken off my tunic; how shall I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

(Song of Solomon 5:4) 
My beloved put his hand in at the hole, and my bowels trembled at his touch.

(Song of Solomon 5:5) 
I arose to open to my beloved: my hands dropped myrrh, and my fingers were full of the best myrrh.

(Song of Solomon 5:6) 
I opened the door of my house to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke. I sought him, and did not find him: I called him, and he did not answer me.

(Song of Solomon 5:7) 
The watchmen that go about the city found me: they struck me and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my cloak.

(Song of Solomon 5:8) 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.

(Song of Solomon 5:9) 
What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you have so charged us?

(Song of Solomon 5:10) 
My beloved is white and ruddy: chosen out of thousands.

(Song of Solomon 5:11) 
His head is like the finest gold: his locks are as the branches of palm trees, black as a raven.

(Song of Solomon 5:12) 
His eyes are like doves upon the brooks of waters, which are washed in milk, and sit near the fullest streams.

(Song of Solomon 5:13) 
His cheeks are as a bed of spices, where the fragrant herbs are. His lips are lilies, dropping the finest myrrh.

(Song of Solomon 5:14) 
His hands are rings of gold, filled with hyacinths. His belly is ivory, distinguished by sapphires.

(Song of Solomon 5:15) 
His legs are marble pillars, which are set upon golden bases. His appearance is like that of Lebanon.

(Song of Solomon 5:16) 
His throat is most sweet, and altogether desirable. Such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

(Song of Solomon 6:1) 
Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with you?

(Song of Solomon 6:2) 
My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

(Song of Solomon 6:3) 
I am for my beloved, and my beloved is for me, who grazes among the lilies.

(Song of Solomon 6:4) 
You are beautiful, my friend, as Thersa, beautiful as Jerusalem, fearsome as an army set in array.

(Song of Solomon 6:5) 
Turn away your eyes from me, for they have made me fly away.

(Song of Solomon 6:6) 
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which have come up from the washing, all twins, and there is not one barren among them.

(Song of Solomon 6:7) 
Like a piece of pomegranate are your cheeks, within your veil.

(Song of Solomon 6:8) 
There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and young women without number:

(Song of Solomon 6:9) 
My dove is one, my perfect one is one, she is the only one of her mother, chosen by her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and concubines, and they praised her.

(Song of Solomon 6:10) 
Who is she that comes forth like the dawn rising, beautiful as the moon, chosen as the sun, fearsome as an army set in array?

(Song of Solomon 6:11) 
I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley, and to examine if the vine had flourished, and if the pomegranates had sprouted.

(Song of Solomon 6:12) 
I knew not; my soul disturbed me. I set my soul, that I might hear;

(Song of Solomon 6:13) 
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon you.

(Song of Solomon 7:1) 
How beautiful you are! How lovely, dearest, in your delights!

(Song of Solomon 7:2) 
Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts, like clusters of dates.

(Song of Solomon 7:3) 
I said: “I will go up into the palm tree, and seize its fruits.”

(Song of Solomon 7:4) 
And let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.

(Song of Solomon 7:5) 
Your throat is like the best wine, which flows for my beloved, bringing the lips of those asleep and their teeth to life.

(Song of Solomon 7:6) 
I am for my beloved, and his desire is for me.

(Song of Solomon 7:7) 
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and stay in the villages.

(Song of Solomon 7:8) 
In the morning, let us arise to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine has flowered, if the flowers have opened, if the pomegranates have borne fruit. There I will give you my breasts.

(Song of Solomon 7:9) 
The mandrakes give off their fragrance. At our gates are all kinds of fruits, both new and old; my beloved, I have kept them for you.

(Song of Solomon 7:10) 
I have stored up new and old fruits for you, my beloved.

(Song of Solomon 7:11) 
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and stay in the villages.

(Song of Solomon 7:12) 
In the morning, let us arise to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine has flowered, if the flowers have opened, if the pomegranates have borne fruit. There I will give you my breasts.

(Song of Solomon 7:13) 
The mandrakes give off their fragrance at our gates: all kinds of fruits, both new and old, my beloved, I have stored up for you.

(Song of Solomon 8:1) 
Oh, that you were like a brother to me, nourished at my mother’s breast! Then I could find you outside, and kiss you, and no one would despise me anymore!

(Song of Solomon 8:2) 
I would lead you, and bring you into my mother's house: there you would teach me. I would give you spiced wine, and the sweetest new wine.

(Song of Solomon 8:3) 
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.

(Song of Solomon 8:4) 
I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir, or awaken my love, until she wants to.

(Song of Solomon 8:5) 
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, overflowing with delights, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was corrupted, there she who bore you was defiled.

(Song of Solomon 8:6) 
Put me like a seal on your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, jealousy is as hard as hell. Its lamps are lamps of fire and flame.

(Song of Solomon 8:7) 
Many waters cannot extinguish love, nor can the floods overwhelm it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly despised.

(Song of Solomon 8:8) 
We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?

(Song of Solomon 8:9) 
If she is a wall, let us build on her battlements of silver. If she is a door, let us enclose her with boards of cedar.

(Song of Solomon 8:10) 
I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Therefore, I am in his eyes as one who has found peace.

(Song of Solomon 8:11) 
Solomon had a vineyard in Baalhamon. He entrusted the vineyard to keepers; each was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.

(Song of Solomon 8:12) 
My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are yours, Solomon, and two hundred for those who guard its fruit.

(Song of Solomon 8:13) 
You who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening; let me hear your voice.

(Song of Solomon 8:14) 
Hasten, my beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young stag on the mountains of spices.

(Wisdom 1:1) 
Love justice, all you who are judges of the earth. Think of the Lord with goodness, and seek Him with a simple heart.

(Wisdom 1:2) 
He is found by those who do not test Him, and He appears to those who have faith in Him.

(Wisdom 1:3) 
Perverse thoughts separate one from God, but virtue corrects those who are unwise.

(Wisdom 1:4) 
For wisdom will not enter into a malevolent soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.

(Wisdom 1:5) 
The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the false, and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding, and will be rejected by the reprobate.

(Wisdom 1:6) 
Wisdom is a friend to man, and will not leave the wicked because of the words of his lips, for God is the witness of his conscience, the examiner of his heart, and the observer of his tongue.

(Wisdom 1:7) 
For the Lord is the spirit of wisdom, and He knows all things, and He who knows all things, knows wisdom, and He who has created wisdom, has investigated wisdom.

(Wisdom 1:8) 
For He loves those who dwell with wisdom.

(Wisdom 1:9) 
For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the arrangement of the stars: being compared to light, she is found to be first.

(Wisdom 1:10) 
After this, night, malice, and death follow.

(Wisdom 1:11) 
But those who remain in her will not fear, but will rest with her.

(Wisdom 1:12) 
For death and life are in her hand, and good will is pleasing to her.

(Wisdom 1:13) 
He who displeases her, becomes so through hatred, wickedness, and sins.

(Wisdom 1:14) 
For sometimes she is with the wicked, but wickedness will not be believed.

(Wisdom 1:15) 
For he who hopes in vanity generates the wind, and he who follows flying birds, pursues foolishness.

(Wisdom 1:16) 
For he departs from the Lord and from the wisdom of His Spirit.

(Wisdom 1:17) 
For the wicked do not speak well of what belongs to God, and those who are without discipline cannot keep her.

(Wisdom 1:18) 
For the Holy Spirit is divided from them, and has departed from their thoughts.

(Wisdom 1:19) 
For wisdom is a loving spirit, and will not acquit the blasphemer from his lips, for God is the witness of his conscience, and the examiner of his heart, and the observer of his tongue.

(Wisdom 2:1) 
Fools think wrongly. Their thoughts are empty and confused.

(Wisdom 2:2) 
They say, “Our life is short and full of sorrows, and there is no cure for death, and no one returns from the grave.”

(Wisdom 2:3) 
We were born by chance, and after this, there will be nothing. Death is like a final seal: no one can come back.

(Wisdom 2:4) 
We came from nothing and will return to nothing. Our breath is like smoke in our nostrils, and our thoughts are like a spark that leaps in our hearts.

(Wisdom 2:5) 
When the body is extinguished, it will turn to ashes, and the spirit will vanish like soft air.

(Wisdom 2:6) 
In time, our name will be forgotten, and no one will remember our deeds.

(Wisdom 2:7) 
We pass like a shadow and cannot return. It is sealed: no one can return.

(Wisdom 2:8) 
Come, then, let us enjoy the good things that are here. Let us enjoy the pleasures of youth.

(Wisdom 2:9) 
Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes, and let the flowers of spring pass us by.

(Wisdom 2:10) 
Let us crown ourselves with roses before they wither. Let none of us be without our share of our luxury.

(Wisdom 2:11) 
Let us have power over the just; for that which is weak is useless.

(Wisdom 2:12) 
Let us oppress the poor and the just, and let us not spare the widow. Let us show no respect for the gray hairs of the old.

(Wisdom 2:13) 
Let our strength be our law of justice, for the weak are shown to be useless.

(Wisdom 2:14) 
So let us lay traps for the just, because they are of no use to us, and they are against our deeds. They condemn us for the sins of our life.

(Wisdom 2:15) 
They claim to have knowledge of God and call themselves the children of God.

(Wisdom 2:16) 
They are a rebuke to our thoughts, and just to look at them is a burden to us.

(Wisdom 2:17) 
Their life is not like that of others, and their ways are different.

(Wisdom 2:18) 
We are regarded as counterfeit coins, and they avoid our ways as if they were unclean.

(Wisdom 2:19) 
They consider the end of the just to be blessed, and they boast of God as their father.

(Wisdom 2:20) 
Let us see, then, if their words are true. Let us test what will happen to them.

(Wisdom 2:21) 
If the just one is truly the Son of God, God will help him and deliver him from the hands of his enemies.

(Wisdom 2:22) 
Let us test him with insult and torture, so that we can understand his gentleness and know his patience.

(Wisdom 2:23) 
Let us condemn him to a most shameful death, for he will be protected, as he claims, by his own words.

(Wisdom 2:24) 
This is what they thought, and they were wrong, for their wickedness blinded them.

(Wisdom 2:25) 
They did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they think that justice would be rewarded or that the souls of the saints would be recompensed.

(Wisdom 2:26) 
For God created man to be imperishable, and He made him in the image of his own likeness.

(Wisdom 2:27) 
By the devil’s envy, death entered the world,

(Wisdom 2:28) 
and those who belong to him imitate him.

(Wisdom 3:1) 
The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and torment will not touch them.

(Wisdom 3:2) 
Fools thought the just were dead, and they considered their death a punishment,

(Wisdom 3:3) 
and their departure an utter destruction;

(Wisdom 3:4) 
but they are at peace.

(Wisdom 3:5) 
And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.

(Wisdom 3:6) 
Having been punished in a few things, they will receive many blessings, for God tested them,

(Wisdom 3:7) 
and found them worthy of Himself.

(Wisdom 3:8) 
As gold in the furnace, He has tried them, and as a holocaust offering, He received them.

(Wisdom 3:9) 
And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall run to and fro as sparks among the reeds.

(Wisdom 3:10) 
They shall judge the nations, and rule over the peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Wisdom 3:11) 
Those who trust in Him will understand the truth, and those who are faithful in love will abide in Him; for grace and peace is to His elect.

(Wisdom 3:12) 
But the wicked will suffer their own condemnation, who have departed from justice.

(Wisdom 3:13) 
For it is better not to be, than to live and work wickedness.

(Wisdom 3:14) 
Certainly, those who think evil and speak impious things will be punished more severely.

(Wisdom 3:15) 
For the hope of the impious is like fluff which is taken away by the wind, and like thin foam that is dispersed by a storm: and like smoke dispersed by the wind,

(Wisdom 3:16) 
and like the memory of a guest who stayed a single day that quickly passes.

(Wisdom 3:17) 
But the just shall live forever, and their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the Most High.

(Wisdom 3:18) 
Therefore they shall receive a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty from the hand of the Lord: because with His right hand He will protect them, and with His arm He will defend them.

(Wisdom 3:19) 
For He will take His zeal as armor, and creation as a weapon to avenge the enemies.

(Wisdom 3:20) 
He will put on justice as a breastplate, and will take the helmet of sincere judgment.

(Wisdom 3:21) 
He will take invulnerable holiness as a shield,

(Wisdom 3:22) 
and He will sharpen severe anger as a sword.

(Wisdom 3:23) 
The whole world will be gathered against the foolish.

(Wisdom 3:24) 
And they will go forth, rejoicing in their scourging.

(Wisdom 4:1) 
It is better to be childless, if that keeps you virtuous, because virtue's legacy is immortal, and it is honored by both God and humanity.

(Wisdom 4:2) 
When virtue is present, it imitates God. The memory of it is honored, because it is with God and with all humanity.

(Wisdom 4:3) 
When virtue is present, it stirs up other virtuous deeds, and it crowns the incorruptible victory of eternity.

(Wisdom 4:4) 
The unjust are quickly destroyed by wickedness, and the offspring of the impious will not have a solid foundation.

(Wisdom 4:5) 
Even if the wicked live a long life, they are considered to be nothing. Their old age is without any honor.

(Wisdom 4:6) 
Even if they die quickly, they have no hope, nor comfort on judgment day.

(Wisdom 4:7) 
The end of the wicked is horrific.

(Wisdom 4:8) 
Even if the just die young, they will be at peace.

(Wisdom 4:9) 
For honorable old age is not measured by the passing of time or the number of years, but by the wisdom of a just man, and old age is a blameless life.

(Wisdom 4:10) 
The one who is pleasing to God is beloved, and the one who has lived among sinners is taken away, so that wickedness does not corrupt his mind, nor deception deceive his soul.

(Wisdom 4:11) 
For the fascination of evil obscures goodness, and the instability of lust perverts the mind without malice.

(Wisdom 4:12) 
Having become perfect in a short time, he lived a long life. Because his soul was pleasing to God, God hurried to take him from the midst of wickedness.

(Wisdom 4:13) 
The people see, but they don't understand, nor do they take it to heart. God's grace, mercy, and concern are with His holy ones, His chosen ones.

(Wisdom 4:14) 
He who dies justly is at peace.

(Wisdom 4:15) 
I understood this, that wisdom is good, and I worked at it in my life. I pursued it, and I was zealous for good things.

(Wisdom 4:16) 
For loving justice is the perfection of wisdom, and knowing His power is the root of the kingdom.

(Wisdom 4:17) 
If you govern provinces and judge nations, the kings will admire wisdom.

(Wisdom 4:18) 
Because they have heard about its wisdom, they have told others about it. And those who have heard it have been amazed by it.

(Wisdom 4:19) 
If wisdom reigns, it will be honored forever. For glory passes quickly, but wisdom remains forever.

(Wisdom 5:1) 
Then the just will stand with great certainty against those who tormented them, and who took away their labors.

(Wisdom 5:2) 
Seeing this, the wicked will be thrown into terrible fear, and they will be amazed at this unexpected salvation.

(Wisdom 5:3) 
They will say to themselves, repenting, and groaning in anguish of spirit: "This is the one we once held up to ridicule and in a form of contempt."

(Wisdom 5:4) 
We foolish ones considered his life to be madness and his end without honor.

(Wisdom 5:5) 
How, then, has he been numbered among the sons of God, and how is his lot among the saints?

(Wisdom 5:6) 
Therefore, we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of justice did not shine upon us, nor did the sun rise for us.

(Wisdom 5:7) 
We have been oppressed by the way of wickedness and destruction, and we have walked difficult paths, but we have not known the way of the Lord.

(Wisdom 5:8) 
What has pride done for us? Or what profit did the boasting of riches give to us?

(Wisdom 5:9) 
All those things have passed away like a shadow, and like a messenger, they have flown away.

(Wisdom 5:10) 
And like a ship that passes through a wave, whose past is not found, nor the trace of its path in the wake of the waves.

(Wisdom 5:11) 
Or like a bird that passes through the air, whose path leaves no trace, but only the striking of the wind, and the light impulse of the air, which it passed through.

(Wisdom 5:12) 
Or like an arrow shot into the body, dividing the air, which immediately is united again: so also we, being born, immediately ceased to be.

(Wisdom 5:13) 
Indeed, our hope is extinguished, like down: and in winter, it is scattered like a leaf from a tree.

(Wisdom 5:14) 
For all our life has passed away like a shadow, and there is no return after our death: and it is sealed and confirmed, because no one returns.

(Wisdom 5:15) 
Therefore, blessed are the just who are in the Lord, and blessed are those who have hoped in the Lord: and those who were in them did not look to vanity, nor did they know vanity.

(Wisdom 5:16) 
These, in the day of their visitation, will shine, and like sparks, they will run in the branches.

(Wisdom 5:17) 
They will judge the nations, and they will rule over the peoples: and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Wisdom 5:18) 
Those who trust in him will understand the truth, and those who are faithful in love will remain in him: because grace and peace belong to His elect.

(Wisdom 6:1) 
All you who judge the earth: love righteousness, and feel the goodness of God, and seek Him with a simple heart.

(Wisdom 6:2) 
He is found by those who do not test Him, and He will appear to those who have faith in Him.

(Wisdom 6:3) 
Evil thoughts separate you from God. But the power of God will expose the wicked.

(Wisdom 6:4) 
For wisdom will not enter a hateful soul, nor will it dwell in a body held in sin.

(Wisdom 6:5) 
The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.

(Wisdom 6:6) 
Because wisdom is far from pride, and it will never embrace a lie.

(Wisdom 6:7) 
The wise, disciplined, and understanding person will flee from wickedness.

(Wisdom 6:8) 
For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.

(Wisdom 6:9) 
The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.

(Wisdom 6:10) 
The beginning of wisdom is to fear God. To understand the good is to obey the law of God.

(Wisdom 6:11) 
The reign of righteousness is holiness and His glory; and its end is a holy life.

(Wisdom 6:12) 
If you love thrones, rulers, and scepters, love wisdom, so you may reign forever.

(Wisdom 6:13) 
For what is quicker than wisdom, which does all things?

(Wisdom 6:14) 
And if virtue is loved, these virtues are the works of wisdom. It teaches temperance, prudence, justice, and fortitude; nothing is more useful to men in life.

(Wisdom 6:15) 
If anyone desires extensive experience, wisdom knows the past, and she estimates what is to come.

(Wisdom 6:16) 
It knows the cunning of speech, and the answers to arguments. She knows signs and wonders before they happen.

(Wisdom 6:17) 
I therefore determined to take her as my life, and my good, and riches; and I did not compare her to any precious stone.

(Wisdom 6:18) 
Because she precedes all good things and comes to me with every good thing.

(Wisdom 6:19) 
All good things came to me together with her, and countless blessings through her hands.

(Wisdom 6:20) 
And I rejoiced in them all, because she followed me.

(Wisdom 6:21) 
I did not know that she was the mother of all these things. For I learned without pretense, and I share without envy, and I do not hide her riches.

(Wisdom 6:22) 
For she is a treasure to men without blemish; those who have used her have obtained the friendship of God, and are commended because of the works of discipline.

(Wisdom 6:23) 
Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given to me. I called on her, and the Spirit of wisdom came to me.

(Wisdom 6:24) 
And I preferred her to kingdoms and thrones, and I considered riches nothing in comparison to her.

(Wisdom 6:25) 
Nor did I compare her to a precious stone, because all gold, in comparison to her, is but a grain of sand, and silver will be considered as mud before her.

(Wisdom 6:26) 
I loved her above health and beauty, and I determined to have her as my light, because her illumination is never extinguished.

(Wisdom 6:27) 
But all good things came to me together with her, and endless blessings through her hands.

(Wisdom 7:1) 
I also am a mortal man, similar to you, and from the earth, earthy.

(Wisdom 7:2) 
And in my mother's womb, I was formed in the flesh.

(Wisdom 7:3) 
Born at one time, I will share the same departure from life.

(Wisdom 7:4) 
But I will call upon all: “God of wisdom, and Spirit of understanding, come into me.”

(Wisdom 7:5) 
A throne of royalty is prepared for me, and I said: “Spouse and dwelling, and all of her works, are mine.”

(Wisdom 7:6) 
God gave me true knowledge, and the knowledge of the saints, so that I might know the order of the ages and the power of the elements,

(Wisdom 7:7) 
the beginning, end, and middle of times; changes of the times, and the turnings of the ages.

(Wisdom 7:8) 
For I know every manifest and hidden thing. I know all things that are and are to come.

(Wisdom 7:9) 
Wisdom, the maker of all things, taught me. For she taught me.

(Wisdom 7:10) 
In her is the understanding spirit, holy, unique, multifaceted, subtle, mobile, eloquent, unpolluted, clear, unharmed, loving good, sharp,

(Wisdom 7:11) 
free, beneficent, humane, stable, certain, quiet, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating all intelligent spirits, pure, and most subtle.

(Wisdom 7:12) 
For wisdom is more mobile than all that is mobile. Because of her purity, she penetrates and pervades all things.

(Wisdom 7:13) 
For she is a vapor of the power of God and a clear emanation of the glory of the Almighty God; therefore, nothing impure enters into her.

(Wisdom 7:14) 
For she is the brightness of eternal light, and a mirror without blemish of God’s majesty, and the image of His goodness.

(Wisdom 7:15) 
And although she is one, she can do all things. Remaining in herself, she renews all things, and through the nations she transfers herself to holy souls, making them friends of God and prophets.

(Wisdom 7:16) 
For her friendship is good, and her works are honorable.

(Wisdom 7:17) 
For she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and virtue. Nothing is more useful to men in life than these things.

(Wisdom 7:18) 
If anyone loves justice, her labors are virtues. For she teaches temperance and prudence, than which nothing is more useful to men in life.

(Wisdom 7:19) 
But if anyone desires much experience, she knows the past, and judges of the future. She knows the subtleties of words and the solving of riddles. She knows signs and wonders before they happen, and the events of the times.

(Wisdom 7:20) 
So, I proposed all these things to myself and brought them in together with her, because wisdom, the maker of all things, taught me.

(Wisdom 7:21) 
For in her is an understanding spirit, holy, unique, multifaceted, subtle, mobile, eloquent, unpolluted, clear, unharmed, loving good, sharp, free, beneficent, humane, stable, certain, quiet, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating all intelligent spirits, pure, and most subtle.

(Wisdom 7:22) 
For receiving wisdom, I will share with the good, and I will be approved by Him who is from the beginning.

(Wisdom 8:1) 
Wisdom reaches from one end of the universe to the other with strength and orders everything gently.

(Wisdom 8:2) 
I have always loved wisdom, seeking her since my earliest youth.

(Wisdom 8:3) 
I desired to marry her. I loved her beauty.

(Wisdom 8:4) 
Her lineage comes from God, and God loves those who live with her.

(Wisdom 8:5) 
Her discipline leads to immortality, and remembering her means understanding God's will.

(Wisdom 8:6) 
If you love thrones and scepters, O rulers of the people, then honor wisdom, that you may reign forever.

(Wisdom 8:7) 
What is wisdom, and how was she made? I will tell you. I will not hide the secrets of God from you.

(Wisdom 8:8) 
I am the beginning of her generation, and I am ordered by the knowledge of God.

(Wisdom 8:9) 
I will proclaim her knowledge and her works, and I will not hide the secrets of God from you.

(Wisdom 8:10) 
I am always with Him, and I am one with Him in everything.

(Wisdom 8:11) 
From eternity, I have existed, and I will never fail, nor will I abandon those who love me.

(Wisdom 8:12) 
When I came to know that wisdom was good, I sought her out.

(Wisdom 8:13) 
I knew that I would not possess her unless God gave her to me. This was a proper and correct understanding.

(Wisdom 8:14) 
Then, I was a good youth, and I acquired a good soul.

(Wisdom 8:15) 
Indeed, though I was good, I came into an unblemished body.

(Wisdom 8:16) 
And knowing that I could not be chaste unless God gave it, and that was wisdom itself—to know that it was a gift—I approached the Lord and begged Him.

(Wisdom 8:17) 
Then I said in my heart, “Father, Lord of mercy, I ask You, give me wisdom, which attends You on Your throne, and is with me in my works.”

(Wisdom 8:18) 
And do not cast me out from among Your children.

(Wisdom 8:19) 
For I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid. Send wisdom from Your holy seat and from the throne of Your glory, that she may be with me and labor with me, so that I may know what is pleasing to You.

(Wisdom 8:20) 
For she knows and understands all things. She will guide me in my works prudently and will guard me.

(Wisdom 8:21) 
Then my works will be acceptable, and I will judge Your people justly, and I will be worthy of my father's throne.

(Wisdom 8:22) 
For who of men can know the counsel of God? Or who can understand what God wills?

(Wisdom 8:23) 
The thoughts of mortals are timid, and our plans are uncertain.

(Wisdom 8:24) 
The body that decays weighs down the soul, and the earthly dwelling depresses the mind, which thinks much.

(Wisdom 8:25) 
And we can barely guess what is on earth, and what is before our eyes we find with difficulty.

(Wisdom 8:26) 
But who can investigate the things in the heavens?

(Wisdom 8:27) 
For who will know Your will unless You give wisdom and send Your Holy Spirit from the highest heavens?

(Wisdom 8:28) 
Then the paths of those on earth were set right, and men learned what pleases You.

(Wisdom 8:29) 
For through wisdom, those who have pleased You, Lord, since the beginning, were healed.

(Wisdom 9:1) 
O Lord, God of our fathers and God of mercy, You made all things by Your word,

(Wisdom 9:2) 
and by Your wisdom You formed man, so that he might govern the creatures that You made,

(Wisdom 9:3) 
and that he might rule the world in holiness and justice, and judge with an upright heart:

(Wisdom 9:4) 
give me wisdom, who sits beside Your throne, and do not cast me out from among Your children:

(Wisdom 9:5) 
because I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid, a man weak in mind and short of understanding, and lacking in the knowledge of Your laws.

(Wisdom 9:6) 
For even if someone is perfect among the sons of men, without Your wisdom he will be held as nothing.

(Wisdom 9:7) 
And even if he were perfect, without Your wisdom he would be regarded as nothing.

(Wisdom 9:8) 
I have been with You, wisdom, and the worker of Your thrones, and I do not know Your works, nor what I should do.

(Wisdom 9:9) 
For what man can know the counsel of God? Or who can understand what God wills?

(Wisdom 9:10) 
For the thoughts of mortals are fearful, and our understandings are uncertain.

(Wisdom 9:11) 
For the body that corrupts weighs down the soul, and this earthly dwelling depresses the understanding that contemplates many things.

(Wisdom 9:12) 
And with difficulty we strive, and we labor, and we have evil things in the present.

(Wisdom 9:13) 
For who knows what is in heaven, except the one who comes down from heaven?

(Wisdom 9:14) 
And who has known Your counsel, unless You have given wisdom, and sent Your Holy Spirit from on high?

(Wisdom 9:15) 
And thus the paths of those on earth were set right, and they learned those things that please You, and by wisdom they were saved.

(Wisdom 9:16) 
For through this have those pleased You been healed, O Lord, from the beginning.

(Wisdom 9:17) 
For even if the son who comes to You is small, he will have wisdom with You, and will not despise You.

(Wisdom 9:18) 
For God knows this, and dwells with wisdom, and will be ruled by wisdom.

(Wisdom 10:1) 
Wisdom protected the just, even when the wicked were being killed, and the just escaped from death.

(Wisdom 10:2) 
Wisdom escapes the wrath of the wicked and reveals the way of the just, even within their own errors.

(Wisdom 10:3) 
She received the just who fled to her, and she did not abandon them during their trials, but delivered them from the snares of the wicked.

(Wisdom 10:4) 
And she led them along the right path and revealed to them the kingdom of God, giving them the knowledge of the holy ones. And she kept them safe during difficult times.

(Wisdom 10:5) 
She delivered the just from their wickedness and did not reject them, but turned away from the wicked when the judgment of the just came.

(Wisdom 10:6) 
And the race of the wicked entered into wrath, who were together with the sorrowing.

(Wisdom 10:7) 
When the multitude of the dead was being taken away, the justice of the Lord did not forget them.

(Wisdom 10:8) 
But giving recompense to the wicked nations and taking vengeance.

(Wisdom 10:9) 
For then, the mortals saw that they were suffering for their sins and, when they were condemned to vanity, they saw that they had suffered in vain.

(Wisdom 10:10) 
For, just as children fleeing to the light and being cast off by death, so these also perished, and the just became participants in the suffering of death.

(Wisdom 10:11) 
And in this thing, when they were, they saw and knew that the just were those whom God had rejected.

(Wisdom 10:12) 
Because of this, they mocked their suffering and, in the pain of their death, despised them, as to what their end would be.

(Wisdom 10:13) 
Then they will come to their judgment, and they will be terrified by fear, and they will marvel at the salvation of the unjust.

(Wisdom 10:14) 
For those who did not believe in God before, but turned away from God, those who hated wisdom and despised her reproofs.

(Wisdom 10:15) 
These, when they were, did not find the ways of justice and did not look upon the light of justice, nor did they receive the splendor of the sun's rays.

(Wisdom 10:16) 
They walked along the wicked way and the paths of destruction, and they did not know the way of the Lord.

(Wisdom 10:17) 
For what did pride profit them? Or what did the boast of riches bring to them?

(Wisdom 10:18) 
All those things passed away like a shadow, and like a messenger hastening.

(Wisdom 10:19) 
And like a ship passing through the sea, whose trace could not be found, nor the path of the keel in the waves.

(Wisdom 10:20) 
Or like a bird flying through the air, for which there is no sign of its passing, but only the air that has been struck and the light, easy movement of wings, afterwards no sign of its path is found.

(Wisdom 10:21) 
Or like an arrow shot at a target, which divided the air and then immediately cut it again, and no trace of its passage could be found.

(Wisdom 10:22) 
So also we, when born, immediately ceased and could show no sign of virtue, but we have been consumed in our wickedness.

(Wisdom 11:1) 
Lord, listen to my plea. Hear my prayer.

(Wisdom 11:2) 
Don't bring your servant to judgment. No one alive can be found perfect in your sight.

(Wisdom 11:3) 
The enemy has pursued my soul and brought my life down to the dirt.

(Wisdom 11:4) 
He has put me in darkness like the dead, and my spirit is exhausted. My heart is deeply troubled.

(Wisdom 11:5) 
I remember the days of old; I reflect on everything you have done, and I meditate on the works of your hands.

(Wisdom 11:6) 
I stretch out my hands to you, my soul is like dry land.

(Wisdom 11:7) 
Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Don't turn away your face from me, or I'll be like those who descend into the pit.

(Wisdom 11:8) 
Let me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I trust in you. Make known to me the way I should walk, because I lift up my soul to you.

(Wisdom 11:9) 
Rescue me from my enemies, Lord; I flee to you for refuge.

(Wisdom 11:10) 
Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your good Spirit guide me on a straight path.

(Wisdom 11:11) 
For your name's sake, Lord, revive me in your righteousness. Bring my soul out of trouble.

(Wisdom 11:12) 
And in your mercy, destroy my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my soul, because I am your servant.

(Wisdom 12:1) 
Your judgments are magnificent, and no one can fully explain what you say.

(Wisdom 12:2) 
And so those who haven't learned have gone astray. The simpleminded have thought unjust things were just, and have considered evil things to be good.

(Wisdom 12:3) 
In this, the good and the evil are the same. Each will be judged on his own life.

(Wisdom 12:4) 
They are wrong in the things they judge, for they don't know God, and they wish to call evil, sin, and unrighteousness just.

(Wisdom 12:5) 
Because of this, you, O Lord, will justly punish the wicked, with the evils they have chosen.

(Wisdom 12:6) 
For your power has not escaped you. You combine justice with your strength.

(Wisdom 12:7) 
For if you judge the just to be powerful, it is not because you think they aren’t strong, or that you don’t care, since you have all power.

(Wisdom 12:8) 
Showing your power to the ones who judge justly. When you are scorned, show your power to those who do not believe in your perfection.

(Wisdom 12:9) 
But you, Lord of power, judge justly and guide us with clemency.

(Wisdom 12:10) 
Because when you want to, you can. For you know the power of your strength.

(Wisdom 12:11) 
And you show your justice to those who do not believe that you are full of strength, and their wickedness to those who have made you out to be ignorant.

(Wisdom 12:12) 
Because after this, when they are ignorant, they will be punished and will grieve.

(Wisdom 12:13) 
Because of this, you have given torment to those who have lived wickedly. You have given the lives that displease you.

(Wisdom 12:14) 
They detested iniquity and the wicked kinds of lives.

(Wisdom 12:15) 
The proof of this is still present because they judged in what they suffered, and they were vindicated in what displeased them.

(Wisdom 12:16) 
And because of this, the wicked, with torment, judged, thinking they were from you, who unjustly did evil things.

(Wisdom 12:17) 
For in the things they sinned in, which they thought were good, they received the punishment of iniquity.

(Wisdom 12:18) 
But others, even the just, they thought weren't worthy of understanding and did not follow their ways. They looked down on their wickedness.

(Wisdom 12:19) 
For they scorned the wicked, and were justly condemned.

(Wisdom 12:20) 
To others, they didn't give offerings, and their works were not known.

(Wisdom 12:21) 
For they, whose works were evil, lost them, and were confused in their wickedness.

(Wisdom 12:22) 
And after this, those who perished felt what they had done with sorrow and are now confused.

(Wisdom 12:23) 
For your judgment is just.

(Wisdom 12:24) 
This is what cast down the wicked: because they scorned the good things they did, and they did not believe in your judgments.

(Wisdom 12:25) 
And because of this, their end is terrible, and their grief is without end.

(Wisdom 13:1) 
Indeed, all people who do not know God are foolish. Although they see all the good that exists, they can not understand the One who is. They have not recognized the artisan, even by considering the work of creation.

(Wisdom 13:2) 
Instead, they worshiped fire, the wind, the swift air, the circle of stars, the violent water, or the sun and the moon, which they considered to be the rulers of the universe.

(Wisdom 13:3) 
If, because they were delighted by such things, they considered them gods, then let them know that there are things far more beautiful than those. The Lord, who created them, is also the Master of all creation.

(Wisdom 13:4) 
If they were astonished by the things they made, because of their power and effect, then let them understand that the One who created them is even more powerful.

(Wisdom 13:5) 
They could have known the One who is by means of these things, for they are evident, and they should have seen Him through the creation.

(Wisdom 13:6) 
However, they are not excusable for this. If they were capable of knowing the world well enough to judge it, how did they not more easily find the Lord of those things?

(Wisdom 13:7) 
They are wretched, and their hope is in the dead. They say that the gods are things made by human hands: gold, silver, crafted statues of animals, useless stone—the work of human hands.

(Wisdom 13:8) 
If they live with such things, then they consider such things good, and place their hope in those things which are dead.

(Wisdom 13:9) 
They are evil because they hope in these things, and they become bad. They have not seen the ways of justice, nor have they entered the paths of righteousness.

(Wisdom 13:10) 
They have not learned justice, nor have they come to know what is good. They have considered the work of their hands to be God, but it is perverse.

(Wisdom 13:11) 
Because of this, mockery will come upon them on the day of judgment.

(Wisdom 13:12) 
It is better not to exist than to exist and commit impiety. It is better to not know God than to not know the life of one who does not know Him.

(Wisdom 13:13) 
Those who seek God, will find Him, and they will not abandon Him.

(Wisdom 13:14) 
He did not reveal to them, nor did He show them, what is evil, so that they would know what is good, and what things oppose them, and through which they will receive even more light.

(Wisdom 13:15) 
For all of their works are more beautiful in this world than their hope, as are the people themselves, and the things they desire.

(Wisdom 13:16) 
Even those who exist in this world will die, and that is why these things are vanity. These are their works, always with them, in which they always hope.

(Wisdom 13:17) 
They will obtain mercy and grace because they have abstained from these things.

(Wisdom 14:1) 
It is vanity to have idols, and the making of them is an act of destruction. The beginning of a spiritual death, and the true source of life's corruption.

(Wisdom 14:2) 
These idols are not real, and they will not last. Therefore, a sudden judgment will come upon all who trust in them.

(Wisdom 14:3) 
For what is the point of a father, working through the pain of his labor, shaping an idol without a soul, a worthless image?

(Wisdom 14:4) 
But the works of such men are dead, and they themselves, together with those they make—they are all dead together.

(Wisdom 14:5) 
They stray together, and those who praise these idols hope in the dead.

(Wisdom 14:6) 
Therefore, because they deserve it, these things happen to them. They also say, “These idols are not good, nor are they alive, for they cannot see us, nor can they hear us, nor can they think, nor can they move.

(Wisdom 14:7) 
They say, “We are the masters of our own fates.

(Wisdom 14:8) 
They say, “We are the masters of our own fates. Each man can live his life.”

(Wisdom 14:9) 
Their idols are but wind. And such wicked men call these idols gods.

(Wisdom 14:10) 
Those who sail on ships across the sea, and who labor in storms, calling out to wood, call out to wooden idols.

(Wisdom 14:11) 
This is how evil began, and why men go astray, and why there is discord.

(Wisdom 14:12) 
For what is it? That which they have made is not good, and that which they have said is nothing.

(Wisdom 14:13) 
For God hates the ungodly, and the ungodliness of men is similarly abominable to Him.

(Wisdom 14:14) 
Therefore, the ungodly will be abominable, and the ungodliness of the ungodly will be as well.

(Wisdom 14:15) 
Therefore, the works of the wicked are a punishment for them.

(Wisdom 14:16) 
Because the wicked have thought that God is evil, and have done wicked deeds, and are worthy of death, they say: “There is no life.” And they thought the wicked should be God.

(Wisdom 14:17) 
Those who do such things are worthy to be punished, and those who think there is no God, are not.

(Wisdom 14:18) 
For the wicked do wicked deeds, speak impious words, and live wicked lives—and these things will cause harm to men.

(Wisdom 14:19) 
Because they thought fire was God, and they saw it die for a while, and then when the wind blew, it would burn up: and they thought that only fire was the Lord of all things.

(Wisdom 14:20) 
They considered fire, wind, the swift spirit of the air, the circle of the stars, raging water, the sun, and the moon to be the rulers of the world.

(Wisdom 14:21) 
If they loved their beauty, they thought they were gods: those who they saw working.

(Wisdom 14:22) 
If they loved these, they should have known that these are far better: for their creator is beauty itself, and that which is created is found in what is being worked: and what they see is not in those who do the working.

(Wisdom 14:23) 
But they are not excused: because they do not know God by these things, and in those who do the working, they have not considered who He is.

(Wisdom 14:24) 
Perhaps those who wander a little are excused: for they desired God, and wanted to find Him, they did not err in the things they see.

(Wisdom 14:25) 
But neither do these men know, because they seek, investigate, and err in His works, when searching for God.

(Wisdom 14:26) 
For, like lovers, they see the works and they themselves do not believe, because those things which they see neither are, nor exist. If they work, so does their spirit.

(Wisdom 15:1) 
Truly, all men are fools who lack the knowledge of God, and who, from visible goods, were not able to understand Him Who is, nor by their works did they recognize Who He was.

(Wisdom 15:2) 
Instead, they have considered fire, wind, the swift air, the circle of stars, excessive water, or the sun and moon, the rulers of the world, as gods.

(Wisdom 15:3) 
If they, delighted by their beauty, thought them gods, let them know that these things are much more beautiful than those things. For their splendor, their beauty, their course, and their movement are in the control of God.

(Wisdom 15:4) 
But even they are not worthy of forgiveness. For if they were able to know so much that they could estimate the age of the world, how did they not more easily find its Lord?

(Wisdom 15:5) 
But even they are excusable in this. For perhaps, though wandering, they seek God, and desire to find Him.

(Wisdom 15:6) 
For conversing with His works, they investigate and are deceived by appearance, because they seem good. But again, they are not worthy of forgiveness.

(Wisdom 15:7) 
For if they had so much knowledge that they could examine the world, how did they not more quickly find its Lord?

(Wisdom 15:8) 
But their life is miserable, and their hope is among the dead, those who place their hope in things made by human hands, gold, silver, skillfully made, and the likeness of beasts, or a useless stone from an ancient work.

(Wisdom 15:9) 
Or perhaps a woodworker has carved wood, polished it carefully, and then cast it aside for use. But his labor is for the fullness of life, and the craftsman is in his work.

(Wisdom 15:10) 
But miserable is he who places hope in the dead and calls dead things gods; for he has seen neither the living, nor the holy, nor the true.

(Wisdom 15:11) 
For they act unjustly at the same time, and their works, their pains, and their thoughts are in vain. Because an idol statue is the beginning of fornication, and their invention is the corruption of life.

(Wisdom 15:12) 
For they were not from the beginning, nor will they be forever. Because that vanity is a useless emptiness and iniquity.

(Wisdom 15:13) 
For death entered the world through ambition, and those who are a part of it experience it.

(Wisdom 15:14) 
For acting unjustly, they thought nothing of it, not realizing that in the very things in which they have done evil, they are also punished.

(Wisdom 15:15) 
For the just thought life was short, and they departed and did not hear their own voice; but those who are not just thought, and not knowing the mysteries of God, did not hope for the reward of justice, nor did they judge the prize of an immaculate soul.

(Wisdom 15:16) 
Because God created man to be inexhaustible, and He made him in the image of His own likeness.

(Wisdom 15:17) 
But through the devil's envy, death entered the world.

(Wisdom 15:18) 
And those who are a part of it experience it.

(Wisdom 16:1) 
A wonderful meal appeared for the righteous and holy ones who were in exile.

(Wisdom 16:2) 
So that, after they had suffered adversity and their enemies were punished, they could taste the sweetness of life.

(Wisdom 16:3) 
For that which the animals, who were not supposed to know the ways of men, were mocking.

(Wisdom 16:4) 
They were sent as a punishment, but not in anger. They were punished briefly, and were then found worthy of blessings.

(Wisdom 16:5) 
For those who feared were in servitude. Those who did not fear were tormented.

(Wisdom 16:6) 
Those who were in darkness, and those who were in ignorance, were both in darkness.

(Wisdom 16:7) 
For as those who are asleep, so too were these who slept in a terrible slumber.

(Wisdom 16:8) 
But God did not destroy those people. He warned the wandering, and, remembering His virtues, warned them.

(Wisdom 16:9) 
For through their suffering, He showed Himself to them for salvation. And, being awake, they knew that He, God, was with them at that moment.

(Wisdom 16:10) 
For the sake of the people who came before them, they were killed by animals.

(Wisdom 16:11) 
They were led astray by their wicked and perverse thoughts, and thought those very things that they imagined to be gods.

(Wisdom 16:12) 
They ended in unjust suffering. And the harm was done through them who are.

(Wisdom 16:13) 
For fire or wild beasts that overcame them were punishments for them, and for their wicked deeds.

(Wisdom 16:14) 
On the contrary, nothing happened against them. They themselves are the ones who have done everything.

(Wisdom 16:15) 
For to the just, not only to them, but also to these others, was given night, and they knowing those things which they have suffered, themselves feared not even death.

(Wisdom 16:16) 
And the son of those who were, came quickly. And, seeing, they saw, and knowing, they knew what justice has suffered.

(Wisdom 16:17) 
Afterwards, when the unjust had died, there was a scourge and a plague to them, and for the righteous, glory.

(Wisdom 16:18) 
For in a short time they were tormented, and dying, they saw their works and knew what they had suffered.

(Wisdom 16:19) 
And as they perished, the just had glory. But for them, in short, who were made as they were, with them, to condemnation.

(Wisdom 16:20) 
And therefore they saw both this, and that, and for that time, and when they were in conflict, they saw, and they heard what it is.

(Wisdom 16:21) 
For they were once cast down, and they did not ignore who they were, and who were for them, and who were for death.

(Wisdom 16:22) 
For, that which they had once wandered, and seeing, they did not believe, now, when they suffered, and knowing, they repented for themselves.

(Wisdom 16:23) 
And, that through which they were judged, those things, when they perished, did not die.

(Wisdom 16:24) 
For, when the just were in conflict, they saw all things, and afterwards, in repentance, they saw; and they did not die.

(Wisdom 16:25) 
But, as they perished, so did they perish in them.

(Wisdom 17:1) 
But those who are spiritually dead don’t know God, and they can’t find Him by looking at good things, and they don’t recognize the craftsman by his work.

(Wisdom 17:2) 
Instead, they think that fire, or wind, or fast-moving air, or the stars’ motion, or rushing water, or the sun and moon, which govern the world, are gods.

(Wisdom 17:3) 
If they were charmed by their appearance, they should know that these things are much better than they seem: the creator of them made these very things.

(Wisdom 17:4) 
If they were amazed by their strength and by how they work, let them understand from these things that whoever made them is stronger than they are:

(Wisdom 17:5) 
because by how great and well-made the creation is, they can understand the creator. So, too, His power is known through these things.

(Wisdom 17:6) 
But still, they have no excuse: if they were able to know so much that they could investigate the world, why did they not find the Lord more quickly?

(Wisdom 17:7) 
But woe to them, and to their works: because they thought that the dead were gods, and also idols, and gold, and silver—man-made objects, and images of animals, or a useless stone from the hands of someone long ago.

(Wisdom 17:8) 
Therefore, if they were pleased with what they made, they thought these things were gods: and what excuse will they give now, because they put their hope in these things?

(Wisdom 17:9) 
For they have power over them in both life and death, and they will be punished on the day when they are judged.

(Wisdom 17:10) 
They are miserable, and they hate His holy ones, and they hate the impious, and they hate His things, and the good, and those who hate life, and those who do evil.

(Wisdom 17:11) 
Their works are evil, and their lives are evil: and they think that God is not with them: and they commit iniquity, and they are perverted by their unjust plans.

(Wisdom 17:12) 
There is a different power of evil, and a different lie, and a different life than they think, and for those who made these things, there is an evil cause, so that their sin will follow them through fire, or through water.

(Wisdom 17:13) 
Because what they do to God, and their sins, pursue them in anger, as they themselves are.

(Wisdom 17:14) 
This is what they think: that if they do well, they will reign, and they will exist, and be glorious. For this reason they are also destructive to themselves.

(Wisdom 17:15) 
Therefore they were angry at the just, and for their sin they killed those who were holy and just in life. Their blood is now avenged.

(Wisdom 17:16) 
But they, being angry, were worth nothing, and they knew nothing, being angry at those who were better than them.

(Wisdom 17:17) 
For this reason they died, and they thought that life was for them, and they were saddened when they died: because even they who died were unjust, and they judged iniquity.

(Wisdom 17:18) 
And since God did not always dissimulate, His power did not dissimulate either. Because this man, who is without God, killed the just, and the just and the impious will perish alike.

(Wisdom 17:19) 
For now the works of the impious are like the wind, and like a ship on water without a rudder, which passes, and the path is unknown after it. And like a bird flying through the air, no trace of the journey is found, and like an arrow shot at a target.

(Wisdom 17:20) 
And like an arrow striking through the air, and the air is immediately divided, and its passing is not known. So also we are born for a short time, and immediately we vanish: and we will not be able to show the trace of a good work: but we will be consumed in malice.

(Wisdom 18:1) 
Remembering His covenant, the Lord sent redeemers to rescue them from the pagan nations.

(Wisdom 18:2) 
He sent holy men: Moses and his brother Aaron. Through them, He gave His people a sense of holiness.

(Wisdom 18:3) 
He gave them His testament so they would be sanctified, and the Law so they could have life.

(Wisdom 18:4) 
He revealed His just judgements, and the works that His hands had made.

(Wisdom 18:5) 
Remembering the covenant, He displayed the wonders of His works.

(Wisdom 18:6) 
He glorified them in holiness and kept them in righteousness.

(Wisdom 18:7) 
He heard their prayers from His holy place.

(Wisdom 18:8) 
He was merciful to them in their days of tribulation and rescued them.

(Wisdom 18:9) 
He struck the Egyptians with plagues that were great and terrifying.

(Wisdom 18:10) 
He showed the power of His hands.

(Wisdom 18:11) 
He gave them a great plague to reveal their wickedness, and He destroyed their enemies.

(Wisdom 18:12) 
He gave His holy ones righteousness and a law without deceit.

(Wisdom 18:13) 
He remembered His covenant and the righteousness of His works.

(Wisdom 18:14) 
He gave them the inheritance of the nations, and the works of the just.

(Wisdom 18:15) 
Both the work of the Lord's hands, and the works of the just, are His.

(Wisdom 18:16) 
He broke the power of their enemies, and gave them the inheritance of the strong.

(Wisdom 18:17) 
So that they would glorify His holy name and offer God their praises.

(Wisdom 18:18) 
He rooted out the impious peoples before them.

(Wisdom 18:19) 
So they would praise His works with justice, and glorify His wonders.

(Wisdom 18:20) 
And they will praise Him with the glory of His power, and they will proclaim the greatness of His works.

(Wisdom 18:21) 
This is the end for those who have acted justly, so they may be with Him.

(Wisdom 18:22) 
And with their works, they enter the glory of the saints.

(Wisdom 19:1) 
The nations who opposed Your commandments, Lord, have done the opposite of what is right.

(Wisdom 19:2) 
Your children knew that the wicked are lost,

(Wisdom 19:3) 
and the wicked perished in the open for all of their enemies to see.

(Wisdom 19:4) 
The Gentiles saw the idols,

(Wisdom 19:5) 
which do not even exist, and they thought the idols were gods.

(Wisdom 19:6) 
Therefore, the Gentiles will be judged by the true judge, as will the dead idols.

(Wisdom 19:7) 
So when the time came for punishment, the Lord visited them and found them worthy of their punishment.

(Wisdom 19:8) 
For the Gentiles were using wicked deeds,

(Wisdom 19:9) 
to do even more foolish things,

(Wisdom 19:10) 
because the Gentiles lacked rational thought.

(Wisdom 19:11) 
They sacrificed their own children to demons,

(Wisdom 19:12) 
and they offered these children to those who do not exist, to idols.

(Wisdom 19:13) 
They murdered their own children,

(Wisdom 19:14) 
and they would murder those who were sacrifices,

(Wisdom 19:15) 
using poison that was wicked, and they were destroyed.

(Wisdom 19:16) 
And because of this, the deception that was created by them could no longer remain hidden.

(Wisdom 19:17) 
For those wicked people, who were like people wandering around in a dream,

(Wisdom 19:18) 
imagined they were actually flying when dreaming.

(Wisdom 19:19) 
The Gentiles died because of these delusions, which they trusted in.

(Wisdom 19:20) 
For they thought things that did not exist were gods.

(Wisdom 19:21) 
They swore false oaths, and did evil things with great anger,

(Wisdom 19:22) 
and because of this, they deserved to be destroyed.

(Wisdom 19:23) 
The false gods they swore by did not have any power, instead, the sin itself deserved punishment.

(Wisdom 19:24) 
They would swear oaths that contained injustice, and would be destroyed by these oaths.

(Sirach 1:1) 
All wisdom comes from the Lord God; it has always been with Him. Wisdom existed before the beginning of time.

(Sirach 1:2) 
Who can count the sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?

(Sirach 1:3) 
Who has searched the height of the sky, the width of the land, and the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 1:4) 
Wisdom was created before all other things, and the understanding of prudence is eternal.

(Sirach 1:5) 
The Word of God in the highest heavens is the source of wisdom, and His eternal commandments are the path to it.

(Sirach 1:6) 
To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? Who has known its cleverness?

(Sirach 1:7) 
Who can describe the knowledge of wisdom? Who has understood its meaning?

(Sirach 1:8) 
There is only one Most High, the all-powerful creator, a mighty King, greatly to be feared, seated on His throne, and a God who rules.

(Sirach 1:9) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit; He saw it, measured it, and gave it understanding.

(Sirach 1:10) 
And He poured out wisdom on all His works, on all flesh according to His gift, and gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 1:11) 
The fear of the Lord is glory, and pride, and joy, and the crown of rejoicing.

(Sirach 1:12) 
The fear of the Lord delights the heart and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 1:13) 
It will go well with the man who fears God in the end, and he will be blessed on the day of his death.

(Sirach 1:14) 
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; it was formed with the faithful in the womb.

(Sirach 1:15) 
It was created with believers and saints, and with the chosen, they are found with faithfulness, knowledge, and belief.

(Sirach 1:16) 
The fear of the Lord is the fullness of the knowledge of piety.

(Sirach 1:17) 
Piety protects them, makes them righteous, and accepts their prayers.

(Sirach 1:18) 
Whoever fears God will have friendship, and his neighbor will be like him.

(Sirach 1:19) 
In wisdom is honor, and glory, and trust, and the crown of righteousness.

(Sirach 1:20) 
The wisdom of the just brings blessings, and the fruit of his glory is honorable.

(Sirach 1:21) 
An enemy of the wicked is not honorable, and the memory of the wicked will be erased.

(Sirach 1:22) 
In the fear of the Lord is length of days, and the years of life will be shortened.

(Sirach 1:23) 
Whoever fears God will do all things, and whoever holds himself back for Him, will be filled on the day of visitation.

(Sirach 1:24) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the acceptance of Him, and it adheres to Him with faith.

(Sirach 1:25) 
All plagues and all anger will come to the wicked, and will not be found in sinners.

(Sirach 1:26) 
Whoever fears God will not neglect His commandments, and the strong will keep His way because of Him.

(Sirach 1:27) 
And all wisdom will know, and those who hold it will praise it; and those who trust in it will be known to Him.

(Sirach 2:1) 
Son, when you are serving God, stand strong in righteousness and with fear, and prepare your soul for the trials ahead.

(Sirach 2:2) 
Humble your heart and remain patient: incline your ear, and understand words of wisdom.

(Sirach 2:3) 
Open your heart to God, and trust in Him, and keep yourself from the abominations of sin.

(Sirach 2:4) 
Look at His commandments, and observe His precepts: and hear your prayer.

(Sirach 2:5) 
Return to the Lord and leave behind your sin: pray in His presence, and reduce your faults.

(Sirach 2:6) 
Turn away from sin, and correct your hands: and cleanse your heart from all impurity of your heart.

(Sirach 2:7) 
And direct your path in the right way, and turn to the elders and the righteous.

(Sirach 2:8) 
Be steadfast in faith and in the fear of God: and remain in peace with patience.

(Sirach 2:9) 
Trust in Him who believes in himself: and he shall not be ashamed in His mercy.

(Sirach 2:10) 
Woe to the double-minded heart, and to the impure lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner who walks the earth with two paths.

(Sirach 2:11) 
Woe to the timid heart: for he does not believe, therefore he will not be protected.

(Sirach 2:12) 
Woe to him who loses patience: and what will he do when the Lord visits?

(Sirach 2:13) 
He who fears God shall persevere, and in his patience he will be justified.

(Sirach 2:14) 
He shall look to himself, and confirm his ways, and understand that iniquity will not dwell in him.

(Sirach 2:15) 
He who fears God will do this: and he who has the law, will turn to these things.

(Sirach 2:16) 
And he who knows them will prepare for them, and will seek them as in the harvest.

(Sirach 2:17) 
He who fears God will direct his ways, and will be enlightened as in the time of the solstice.

(Sirach 2:18) 
And those who trust in the Lord will understand His glory.

(Sirach 2:19) 
Do not fear the words of the sinner: for his glory is consumed in dung.

(Sirach 2:20) 
He will exult in the days of his prosperity, and in the days of adversity he will not be remembered.

(Sirach 2:21) 
The fear of God is of fear, and it will not perish: and in the days of trial, the righteous will persevere.

(Sirach 2:22) 
The wise man does not hate the law of God, and there will be no lie in it, and the impious perish in it.

(Sirach 2:23) 
He who fears God directs his heart, and humbles his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 2:24) 
If you do not do this, you will fall into evil: and God will confound you in the sight of your enemies.

(Sirach 2:25) 
Hold fast to righteousness until death, and fight for the truth, and God will fight for you against your enemies.

(Sirach 2:26) 
Do not be quick with your tongue: and be negligent in your works.

(Sirach 2:27) 
Be quick to listen to God, and answer in your patience: if you have understanding.

(Sirach 2:28) 
If you have understanding, answer your neighbor: but if not, put your hand upon your mouth, lest you be caught in an undisciplined word, and be ashamed.

(Sirach 2:29) 
Have no preference in glory and shame, and do not be afraid to confess your sins in truth.

(Sirach 2:30) 
Do not be like a lion in your house, looking at your servants, and frightening them.

(Sirach 2:31) 
Let your hand not be for receiving, and let it be slow to give.

(Sirach 3:1) 
My son, listen to me, and respond to my voice, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 3:2) 
Because great is His glory, and great is His grace, and who will search out His fear?

(Sirach 3:3) 
The fear of the Lord brings glory, and boasting, and joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 3:4) 
The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, and give joy, and gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 3:5) 
He who fears God will be well in the end, and in the day of consummation he will be saved.

(Sirach 3:6) 
He will not fear fear, nor will he be troubled: because he is his hope.

(Sirach 3:7) 
The fear of God is like a paradise of blessing: they have covered all glory.

(Sirach 3:8) 
Everyone who feared the Lord, he received, and blessing him.

(Sirach 3:9) 
Because the fear of God, and honor, and joy, and the crown of exultation is.

(Sirach 3:10) 
Choosing the fear of God, and his works, and his love, and his ways.

(Sirach 3:11) 
He who holds Him is prepared for everything, and his life will not be separated because of Him.

(Sirach 3:12) 
The beginning of all evils is pride: he who is held by it, will abound in impiety.

(Sirach 3:13) 
Therefore the proud are crushed, and as a rod they are crushed: and their memory is iniquitous, and it will not be.

(Sirach 3:14) 
The pleasing of God is not for the proud: because they are turned away from God.

(Sirach 3:15) 
Pride is the beginning of all sin: he who holds it, will pour out impiety: therefore God has discovered harsh vices, and overturned them.

(Sirach 3:16) 
God has overturned the seats of the proud leaders.

(Sirach 3:17) 
God has taken away iniquitous nations.

(Sirach 3:18) 
God has uprooted the roots of the proud.

(Sirach 3:19) 
God sits on the throne of judgment, and in his spirit there is no iniquity.

(Sirach 3:20) 
Who will tell the works of the Most High? Because they are His wonders.

(Sirach 3:21) 
Who will tell the power of His majesty? And who will be able to tell His mercy?

(Sirach 3:22) 
Nothing is diminished, and nothing is added, nor can the wonders of God be found.

(Sirach 3:23) 
When man finishes, then he will begin: and when he rests, then he will doubt.

(Sirach 3:24) 
What is man? And what is his grace? What is his good, or what is his evil?

(Sirach 3:25) 
The number of days of men, all at most are one hundred years.

(Sirach 3:26) 
Like a drop of sea water, and like a grain of sand, so few are the years in the day of eternity.

(Sirach 3:27) 
This is the glory of man: and greater than that, is not for him in his life.

(Sirach 3:28) 
His blood is his flesh, and his spirit: the works of the wicked will be broken.

(Sirach 3:29) 
Piety, and mercy will remain, and good works: and their reward with them.

(Sirach 3:30) 
My soul is pleased with two kinds, and the third is pleasing to me: he who is grieved, and he who loves his brothers.

(Sirach 3:31) 
He who does not sin with his tongue, and is not grieved in his mind.

(Sirach 3:32) 
He who is not grieved in his mind, will not be grieved in his works.

(Sirach 3:33) 
He who fears God in his heart, and is justified in all signs.

(Sirach 4:1) 
My son, if you give yourself to serving God, brace yourself for the trials of faith.

(Sirach 4:2) 
Set your heart straight, be resolute, and don't rush in times of hardship.

(Sirach 4:3) 
Stay close to Him, and don't turn away, so that you may be rewarded in the end.

(Sirach 4:4) 
Accept whatever is brought upon you, and be patient in times of pain.

(Sirach 4:5) 
Gold is tested by fire, and acceptable men are tested in the furnace of hardship.

(Sirach 4:6) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you; make your ways straight, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 4:7) 
Those who fear God will not tremble, and will not be afraid, because He is their hope.

(Sirach 4:8) 
Blessed is the soul of those who fear God.

(Sirach 4:9) 
Because of their fear of God, they will love Him, and in their faith, they will hope.

(Sirach 4:10) 
Those who fear God will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 4:11) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of men.

(Sirach 4:12) 
For as great as He is, so is His mercy, and as great as His name, so is His glory.

(Sirach 4:13) 
God will have mercy on those who confess and give thanks to Him in the sight of all.

(Sirach 4:14) 
The fool will be troubled in times of evil.

(Sirach 4:15) 
The wise will not be troubled by evils.

(Sirach 4:16) 
A wise heart will understand a parable, and an attentive ear will desire wisdom.

(Sirach 4:17) 
As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 4:18) 
He who gives thanks will remember the future, and will find strength in the time of need.

(Sirach 4:19) 
The sons of evildoers are like a mist driven by the wind, here today, and gone tomorrow.

(Sirach 4:20) 
Blessed is he who perseveres in the fear of God.

(Sirach 4:21) 
Because in the end, he will be saved.

(Sirach 4:22) 
Those who love God choose such fear of God.

(Sirach 4:23) 
Those who fear the Lord do His will, and those who endure in Him will find blessing.

(Sirach 4:24) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 4:25) 
They will fall into the hands of God.

(Sirach 4:26) 
Better is the one who has no means and boasts, than he who has means and lies.

(Sirach 4:27) 
More precious is he who is not rich but fears God, than he who is rich and proud.

(Sirach 4:28) 
A just and poor man, fearing God, is better than a rich and arrogant man.

(Sirach 4:29) 
A wise and poor man, in the fear of God, will please God more than a rich, and very proud man.

(Sirach 4:30) 
The death of the just is in God's hand, and evil will not touch them.

(Sirach 4:31) 
But fools and sinners will be destroyed by His wrath.

(Sirach 4:32) 
The fear of the Lord brings health and fullness, and His visitation takes away sins.

(Sirach 4:33) 
He who fears Him will not fear; and will not be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 4:34) 
Of the fear of the Lord, nothing is to be feared, and there is no fear in disturbance.

(Sirach 4:35) 
Blessed is everyone who fears God.

(Sirach 4:36) 
For by the fear of the Lord he is helped, and in the days of the end, he will hope well.

(Sirach 4:37) 
The fear of God belongs to all creation; and to it, God gives glory.

(Sirach 4:38) 
It is better to die than to live and see evil.

(Sirach 4:39) 
A sad life, and a voluntary death.

(Sirach 4:40) 
In all your work, remember your last end, and you will not sin forever.

(Sirach 5:1) 
Do not put your trust in an enemy, and do not give yourself over to his authority.

(Sirach 5:2) 
Because all men conceal the sins they do against themselves.

(Sirach 5:3) 
Be cautious around your neighbor, because he seeks to harm you.

(Sirach 5:4) 
And his hatred could turn against you.

(Sirach 5:5) 
Do not believe everything you hear; for every tongue has its own faults.

(Sirach 5:6) 
Because in their wicked deeds, they sin.

(Sirach 5:7) 
And they do not live in the fear of God.

(Sirach 5:8) 
For God's eyes watch over the ways of men, and He knows every path.

(Sirach 5:9) 
He has not commanded anyone to act wickedly, nor has He given anyone permission to sin.

(Sirach 5:10) 
He does not rejoice in works of the flesh, nor does the impious man hold power over Him.

(Sirach 5:11) 
Before men's good and bad deeds, the Lord sees all; He sees them.

(Sirach 5:12) 
He looks upon each of their works.

(Sirach 5:13) 
Do not say, “I have sinned, and what has happened to me?”

(Sirach 5:14) 
For the Most High is patient.

(Sirach 5:15) 
But as for atonement, be without fear. Do not add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 5:16) 
And do not say, “God’s mercy is great, and He forgives many sins.”

(Sirach 5:17) 
Because mercy and anger are swift with Him, and His wrath rests upon sinners.

(Sirach 5:18) 
Do not delay turning back to the Lord, nor put it off day by day.

(Sirach 5:19) 
For suddenly His wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance you will perish.

(Sirach 5:20) 
Do not put your trust in unjust riches, nor say, “I have enough for life.”

(Sirach 5:21) 
For they will not help you on the day of wrath and vengeance.

(Sirach 5:22) 
Do not follow the paths of your heart and your own strength.

(Sirach 5:23) 
And do not say, “Who will restrain me?”

(Sirach 5:24) 
Because God can surely punish,

(Sirach 5:25) 
and know that God will not delay long.

(Sirach 5:26) 
Do not be without fear of your sins, and do not add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 5:27) 
And do not say, “God’s mercy is great, and He will forgive many of my sins.”

(Sirach 5:28) 
Because both mercy and wrath are swift with Him, and His wrath rests upon the impious.

(Sirach 5:29) 
Do not delay turning to the Lord, and do not put it off day by day.

(Sirach 5:30) 
For suddenly His wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance you will perish.

(Sirach 5:31) 
Like the pains of a woman in labor, is the day of wrath for the impious.

(Sirach 5:32) 
He will carry the son he thought was dead, but he will have no help.

(Sirach 5:33) 
Such is the day of visitation for the impious.

(Sirach 6:1) 
I wish to speak of wisdom and discipline, and of the understanding of the senses.

(Sirach 6:2) 
For, as wisdom comes from God, it is also glorious.

(Sirach 6:3) 
In the beginning, God created it, and poured it out over all His works.

(Sirach 6:4) 
When there is fear of the Lord, there is glory, honor, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 6:5) 
The heart of God has chosen the fear of the Lord, and he has kept it in sanctification, justice, and faith.

(Sirach 6:6) 
The fear of God is the commandments, and discipline preserves life.

(Sirach 6:7) 
Those who fear God will fear nothing and will not be afraid, because He is their hope.

(Sirach 6:8) 
The soul of the fear of God is life, and those who have it will be visited by God, and will be blessed.

(Sirach 6:9) 
The wise will receive it, and, as a mother, will honor it, and, as a bride marrying, will receive it.

(Sirach 6:10) 
And it will nourish them with the bread of life, and will give them the water of salvation.

(Sirach 6:11) 
The foundation of wisdom is to fear God, and to keep faith, to love, and to keep the words of the just in justice and with others.

(Sirach 6:12) 
Pride is the abomination of the wicked; the just are not near to pride.

(Sirach 6:13) 
The beginning of pride is for a man to apostatize from God: because his heart has receded from Him who made him.

(Sirach 6:14) 
The beginning of pride is sin: and those who hold it pour out abominations.

(Sirach 6:15) 
Therefore, the Lord has brought upon them terrible plagues: and He has broken them to the end.

(Sirach 6:16) 
As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sins.

(Sirach 6:17) 
Those who give back good deeds will be mindful of the future: in the time when their feet falter, they will find firmness.

(Sirach 6:18) 
Those who keep the commandments guard their souls: and those who hope in God will not be ashamed.

(Sirach 6:19) 
The fear of the Lord is the glory of the wise.

(Sirach 6:20) 
The wise keep justice: and those who practice justice refer to His glory.

(Sirach 6:21) 
The wise works in words: and the prudent are confirmed in the law.

(Sirach 6:22) 
Those who trust in the law prepare understanding, and those who perfect it, are, as a river, full of wisdom.

(Sirach 6:23) 
Those who cultivate the law prepare it: and its fruit is sanctification.

(Sirach 6:24) 
Still pursuing it, they will arrive at it: and its paths are very clear, and they will not labor on its road.

(Sirach 6:25) 
The wise will pass through the earth, so that they may give testimony: and all those who understand will seek it.

(Sirach 6:26) 
Seeking it, as the first, and the Lord will not fail at any time.

(Sirach 6:27) 
And again I considered in my heart, so that I may know what is good, and what I should do, and I will keep discipline.

(Sirach 6:28) 
And again I began to love it, and found it good.

(Sirach 6:29) 
Those who choose good, will be chosen, and those who love its works, will be sanctified.

(Sirach 6:30) 
Those who do its works, their life is always good.

(Sirach 7:1) 
Don't do evil deeds, and evil won't befall you.

(Sirach 7:2) 
Turn away from wickedness, and wickedness will turn away from you.

(Sirach 7:3) 
My son, don't plant bad seeds in the furrows of wickedness, or you'll harvest them sevenfold.

(Sirach 7:4) 
Don't ask the Lord for a position of authority, nor the king for a seat of honor.

(Sirach 7:5) 
Don't try to justify yourself before God, because He knows the hearts of all.

(Sirach 7:6) 
Don't desire to be a judge unless you are strong in virtue. Don't be afraid of the powerful. Then, your justice won't be a stumbling block.

(Sirach 7:7) 
Don't sin against the multitude of a city, and don't thrust yourself upon the people.

(Sirach 7:8) 
Don't commit a double sin: because not even one will go unpunished.

(Sirach 7:9) 
Don't say: “God will look at the multitude of my gifts and, when I give them to the Most High, He will accept them.”

(Sirach 7:10) 
Don't be doubtful in your prayers, and don't neglect to do good deeds.

(Sirach 7:11) 
Don't mock the scornful, because there is One who sees and punishes.

(Sirach 7:12) 
Don't neglect the poor when you judge, because there is One who defends the poor.

(Sirach 7:13) 
Make the judgment of the poor, and don't be swayed by the powerful.

(Sirach 7:14) 
Judge according to wisdom, and give a just judgment.

(Sirach 7:15) 
Humble your heart and be patient, and incline your ear and receive the words of the wise. Don't disregard the proverbs of the wise and practice them in their parables.

(Sirach 7:16) 
My son, work on your work, and you will be educated in its doctrine.

(Sirach 7:17) 
Those who fear the Lord will find judgment, and their righteousness will shine like light.

(Sirach 7:18) 
The sinner will flee from correction and will find excuses according to his own will.

(Sirach 7:19) 
A man of counsel will not neglect counsel. The timid and lazy will not remain in the commandments.

(Sirach 7:20) 
Do nothing without counsel, and after you've done it, you won't repent.

(Sirach 7:21) 
Don't walk on an unsafe road, and don't stumble on stones.

(Sirach 7:22) 
Don't trust in your own faith alone; guard your ways.

(Sirach 7:23) 
Don't be disheartened in your works.

(Sirach 7:24) 
Be faithful in all your works. This is the keeping of the commandments.

(Sirach 7:25) 
He who believes in God attends to the commandments, and he who hopes in Him will not be diminished.

(Sirach 8:1) 
Don’t start a fight with anyone stronger than you, or you may fall into their power.

(Sirach 8:2) 
Many have ruined themselves seeking riches, and they could not use those riches to save their souls.

(Sirach 8:3) 
For the value of a soul is beyond all price.

(Sirach 8:4) 
Don’t waste your goods on the wrong things, or your labor on what is not yours.

(Sirach 8:5) 
Don't be overconfident in your own power, and don't go after all of your desires.

(Sirach 8:6) 
Don’t say, “Who can stop me now that I’m in control?” Remember that bad days happen to everyone.

(Sirach 8:7) 
Don't be overwhelmed by your feelings, and don't let your imagination run wild.

(Sirach 8:8) 
Don’t say, “God is so merciful that he will forgive all my sins,” and then continue sinning.

(Sirach 8:9) 
For God is both merciful and angry. His anger will stay with the ungodly.

(Sirach 8:10) 
Don't put off turning back to God, and don't delay from day to day. For his wrath will come suddenly.

(Sirach 8:11) 
Then, when the time comes to face the consequences, you will be destroyed.

(Sirach 8:12) 
Don't trust in ill-gotten money or in great wealth. For they will not help you on the day of God's wrath.

(Sirach 8:13) 
In the day of tribulation and judgment.

(Sirach 8:14) 
Don’t be like a reed blowing in the wind. Don’t go down every path you see. This is what a double-minded sinner does.

(Sirach 8:15) 
For a double-minded man has an unstable heart.

(Sirach 8:16) 
A good heart fears the bad, because it will be tested in the good.

(Sirach 8:17) 
For a good heart always fears, and will not be sad even on joyful days.

(Sirach 8:18) 
The one who fears God will be blessed, and will have a long life.

(Sirach 8:19) 
The end of fearing God is life. And those who find it will live long.

(Sirach 8:20) 
The fear of God is the beginning of his love. Faith is the beginning of clinging to him.

(Sirach 8:21) 
A troubled soul will lose its glory, and eyes clouded by sadness will be troubled.

(Sirach 8:22) 
Do not be hard-hearted, and do not give your soul over to sorrows.

(Sirach 8:23) 
Joy in the heart is the life of a man, and happiness lengthens his days.

(Sirach 8:24) 
Love yourself by caring for your soul, and you will again be comforted in the good things of the righteous.

(Sirach 8:25) 
Those who love themselves, love life, and those who watch out for it will find joy.

(Sirach 8:26) 
Those who control their hands, control their tongues, and those who avoid scandal will be spared the bad.

(Sirach 8:27) 
Speak often, and then wait; and don’t be like a doctor with his tongue.

(Sirach 8:28) 
If you are among important people, act like one of them. And when you become wise, let others seek you out.

(Sirach 8:29) 
Childish actions are like a woman in childbirth, and the mercy of men is available in their days.

(Sirach 8:30) 
A wise man is silent until the right time.

(Sirach 9:1) 
The one who fears God will do good, and the one who perseveres in righteousness will hold fast to it.

(Sirach 9:2) 
And justice will come out to meet him like an honorable mother, or like a virgin's wife.

(Sirach 9:3) 
He will feed on the food of wisdom, and will drink the drink of prudence.

(Sirach 9:4) 
He will not be bent by iniquity, nor will sin have dominion over him.

(Sirach 9:5) 
He will not be found among evil people, and he will not dwell among sinners.

(Sirach 9:6) 
He is turned away by the proud, and in his truth he visits the humble, and he perseveres in the thoughts of the just.

(Sirach 9:7) 
God hates the sacrifices of the wicked, and he detests the vows of evildoers.

(Sirach 9:8) 
And the Lord does not cease until he looks upon the just, and rewards them.

(Sirach 9:9) 
He will not delay to avenge the just, and he will keep the piety of the elect.

(Sirach 9:10) 
Like a shadow of a cloud, the day of the wicked passes; but the just perseveres in time, and on the day of reckoning.

(Sirach 9:11) 
The mouth of wisdom will tell forth wisdom, and the tongue of the just will judge.

(Sirach 9:12) 
A just man will love what is good, and the impious will hate it.

(Sirach 9:13) 
The root of good is the fear of God, and the root of impiety is a lack of understanding.

(Sirach 9:14) 
In the heart of the unwise, folly rests, but the wise rest in their own heart.

(Sirach 9:15) 
In the heart of the prudent, wisdom rests, and the thoughts of man are like the sea.

(Sirach 9:16) 
The proverbs of fools are like a ruined house on the road, and the counsel of the unwise is like a question on the road.

(Sirach 9:17) 
Doctrine to the foolish is like a snare to the feet, and like fetters on the hands.

(Sirach 9:18) 
A fool raises his voice in laughter, but the wise are moderate, as if silent.

(Sirach 9:19) 
The words of the wise are like a mirror in a mirror, but the heart of a fool is like an unfeeling vessel.

(Sirach 9:20) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured vessel; he will not hold any teaching.

(Sirach 9:21) 
A wise man will hear every word of wisdom, and will prove it, and take it to himself.

(Sirach 9:22) 
A fool will not endure, but will mock.

(Sirach 9:23) 
The words of a fool are like a burden on the road; on the lips of the prudent, grace will be found.

(Sirach 9:24) 
The mouth of the prudent is sought in the church, and his words are like precious stones in their hearts.

(Sirach 9:25) 
A fool is like a house on the road, open to all who pass by.

(Sirach 9:26) 
Like dead stones in high places are the words of fools; in the counsel of the wicked they are like a strong rope.

(Sirach 9:27) 
A wise man, in his words, is like a learned man, and the prudent are weighed and measured.

(Sirach 9:28) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured vessel, it will never be able to retain understanding.

(Sirach 9:29) 
The law of the impious is hateful to him, like chains on his feet.

(Sirach 9:30) 
The wise man seeks wisdom, and it is like a cloud of mist to his eyes.

(Sirach 9:31) 
The heart of a fool is like a punctured barrel, it will hold no doctrine.

(Sirach 9:32) 
The wise will be silent until the right time.

(Sirach 10:1) 
The wisdom of God speaks to all people, and all who see God's works will declare his greatness.

(Sirach 10:2) 
His great works are full of glory, and his wisdom is hidden from those who don't want it.

(Sirach 10:3) 
Who can tell how the wisdom of God works, and who can fully understand its depths?

(Sirach 10:4) 
Who knows the plan that God is following? Who understands what God is doing?

(Sirach 10:5) 
Who can describe the beauty of God's glory? Who can tell of his magnificent deeds?

(Sirach 10:6) 
What more can we say about the wisdom of God? What can we take away? What more is there to say about all of the wonders of God?

(Sirach 10:7) 
Who can study God's wisdom and fully understand it?

(Sirach 10:8) 
The fear of God is the beginning of glory, of rejoicing, and of the crown of a good life.

(Sirach 10:9) 
The fear of God is the delight of the heart, and will bring joy, happiness, and a long life.

(Sirach 10:10) 
Those who fear God will have a good life, and will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 10:11) 
The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; it has been woven into the very fiber of a faithful person.

(Sirach 10:12) 
For the wicked, there is only anger, confusion, and the day of condemnation.

(Sirach 10:13) 
From the beginning, all creation was made to preserve life, and to bring the wicked to destruction.

(Sirach 10:14) 
The words of a person can change the heart, and will burn like a fire.

(Sirach 10:15) 
The ways of the sinful person are full of deceit, and they have no mercy.

(Sirach 10:16) 
Charity and mercy will receive mercy and will watch over each person as they would their own eyes.

(Sirach 10:17) 
Then God will reward everyone according to their deeds and their knowledge.

(Sirach 10:18) 
Do not say, "I will hide from God," and "Who in the heavens will remember me?"

(Sirach 10:19) 
God sees everything; no one can hide from Him.

(Sirach 10:20) 
The works of justice are like fruit-bearing trees, and thoughts of truth are a strong root.

(Sirach 10:21) 
You prepared for it to be in place forever. Justice is honored in the presence of God.

(Sirach 10:22) 
The just man will not go astray.

(Sirach 10:23) 
The just man is always in the sight of God, like the sun shining in God's presence.

(Sirach 10:24) 
God tests the righteous, and puts them to the test.

(Sirach 10:25) 
He tests them like gold in a furnace, and they will be humbled at the time of their testing.

(Sirach 10:26) 
The wicked are like burning coals in a furnace, and they will be consumed on the day of judgment.

(Sirach 10:27) 
But the righteous will shine, and will run like sparks through the reeds.

(Sirach 10:28) 
They will judge the nations, and will rule over the people, and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Sirach 10:29) 
Those who trust in God will understand the truth, and those who remain faithful in love will remain in him, because grace and peace are given to his elect.

(Sirach 11:1) 
A wise man will govern his people, and a wise man's rule will be stable.

(Sirach 11:2) 
As the leader of the people is, so also are his helpers; and as the leader of the city is, so also are those who live within it.

(Sirach 11:3) 
A foolish king will destroy his people, but a city will be well-governed through the wisdom of its leaders.

(Sirach 11:4) 
The earth is in God's hand, and in His time, He will raise up a useful man.

(Sirach 11:5) 
The prosperity of man is in God's hand, and God will bring honor to the face of a wise man.

(Sirach 11:6) 
Do not be angry with your neighbor for every wrong, and do not commit any deed of injustice.

(Sirach 11:7) 
Pride is hateful to God and men, and injustice is hateful to both.

(Sirach 11:8) 
A kingdom is transferred from nation to nation because of injustices, insults, and greed.

(Sirach 11:9) 
Nothing is more proud than man: for all these things are ash and dust.

(Sirach 11:10) 
What is so proud about being ash, when your heart is full of stench?

(Sirach 11:11) 
The doctor’s sickness is incurable: and the one who is king today will die tomorrow.

(Sirach 11:12) 
When a man dies, he will inherit serpents, wild beasts, and worms.

(Sirach 11:13) 
The beginning of man's pride is to turn away from God: because his heart has withdrawn from his Creator.

(Sirach 11:14) 
Because the beginning of all sin is pride: he who embraces it will be filled with a curse, and it will destroy him in the end.

(Sirach 11:15) 
Therefore, God has afflicted the arrogant, and has crushed them even to their foundation.

(Sirach 11:16) 
God has cast out those who were thought to be gods from the earth: and their memory is no more.

(Sirach 11:17) 
Pride was not created with men, nor was wrath created with those who are born of women.

(Sirach 11:18) 
But from the beginning, pride and wrath have existed in those who departed from God.

(Sirach 11:19) 
Sin and wrath are both detestable: he who clings to them will be filled with impiety.

(Sirach 11:20) 
Therefore, God brought tribulations to the arrogant: and He has scattered them to the end.

(Sirach 11:21) 
As fire rages, so does the wrath of the wicked: and as a flame consumes, so does his heart.

(Sirach 11:22) 
How will an angry man act against his Creator? And how will a fool believe in God?

(Sirach 11:23) 
All patience of man is for a short time: and afterwards, the joy of the unfaithful will be changed.

(Sirach 11:24) 
They will suffer for a time, and afterwards, their evils will be thrown back at them.

(Sirach 11:25) 
Their good deeds will be hidden from the sight of men, and in the hearing of the wicked they will be destroyed.

(Sirach 11:26) 
The wicked son does not have strong roots: and the seed of the wicked will not have a foundation.

(Sirach 11:27) 
And if it sprouts in branches, its shoots will not last: and it will be torn down by the wind, and uprooted.

(Sirach 11:28) 
Its fruit is imperfect: and its fruits are useless to eat: and good for nothing.

(Sirach 11:29) 
The altar of the wicked is not in the children, nor in the roots of rottenness.

(Sirach 11:30) 
But the children of the wicked will not multiply: and the generation of the unfaithful will not have a foundation.

(Sirach 11:31) 
The generation of the children of the wicked will be destroyed.

(Sirach 11:32) 
The children of the wicked, like branches, will not have a firm root: and their fruit will be like the wind.

(Sirach 11:33) 
The leaves of the wicked will not flourish: and like dust and the smoke of evils, they will not endure.

(Sirach 11:34) 
He who loves God will remain in wisdom: and His law will illuminate, like light.

(Sirach 12:1) 
If you do good deeds, know who receives them, and the benefit will go to those who deserve it.

(Sirach 12:2) 
Do good for a righteous person, and you will get a great reward. If not from them, certainly from God.

(Sirach 12:3) 
It's not good for the one who insists on doing evil and refuses to give to the poor. He will also be pitied by those to whom he shows no mercy.

(Sirach 12:4) 
Give to the merciful, but don’t receive a sinner. Don’t give hospitality to the wicked.

(Sirach 12:5) 
Do good for the humble, but not for the wicked. Refuse the bread, and don't give it to him, lest he uses it for evil purposes.

(Sirach 12:6) 
Give to the good, but don’t receive a sinner.

(Sirach 12:7) 
Give more to the righteous, and don’t hold back from the wicked.

(Sirach 12:8) 
It is better to give to the just man than to receive. Neither one will be given to the wicked.

(Sirach 12:9) 
Both are equally detestable to God, and the injustice of each is the same.

(Sirach 12:10) 
The righteous will be tested in times of trial, like gold in a furnace.

(Sirach 12:11) 
A sad heart will change one's face, and a wicked heart will contract.

(Sirach 12:12) 
A good heart is joyful, and its thoughts are always in the light.

(Sirach 12:13) 
Don't fear the words of the wicked because his glory will be in the dung.

(Sirach 12:14) 
Flourishing today, he will not be found tomorrow. His dust will return to dust, and his memory will perish.

(Sirach 12:15) 
Keep the commandments, and you will learn how to think. You will not be disturbed by evil.

(Sirach 12:16) 
The heart of the righteous meditates on faith, and justice, and the fear of God.

(Sirach 12:17) 
The heart of sinners meditates on wickedness, in disturbances and offenses.

(Sirach 12:18) 
God illuminates the work of a good man in judgment and finds it in darkness.

(Sirach 12:19) 
It is not good for the wicked to have riches, and the just to be poor.

(Sirach 12:20) 
The righteous person will not be sad about death, but the wicked person hopes for it.

(Sirach 12:21) 
Wisdom is recognized from the speech of the wise, and the mouth of the fool is crushed.

(Sirach 12:22) 
The speech of the wicked is in disturbance, but he will be pierced in joy.

(Sirach 12:23) 
When a man dies, he inherits serpents, wild beasts, and worms.

(Sirach 12:24) 
The beginning of pride in man is to turn away from God. He who departs from his Creator, his heart departs from himself.

(Sirach 12:25) 
Because the beginning of all sin is pride. He who holds onto it will be filled with curses, and it will ruin him in the end.

(Sirach 12:26) 
Therefore, the Lord was grieved by the scourges of the wicked and utterly destroyed them.

(Sirach 12:27) 
The root of pride is the iniquity of man. He who holds it will pour it out like water.

(Sirach 12:28) 
Therefore, God delivered them to destruction and overthrew them in the end.

(Sirach 12:29) 
Like the flow of waters, so was the earth burned by the proud, and their glory perished from them.

(Sirach 12:30) 
Wisdom is a grace to the just, but the sacrifice of sinners is abominable.

(Sirach 13:1) 
Whoever touches pitch will be dirtied by it, and whoever is involved with the proud will share in their pride.

(Sirach 13:2) 
Don't become one of them, and you won't perish.

(Sirach 13:3) 
What's so great about handling clay? And who is kept pure by touching it?

(Sirach 13:4) 
What's so great about someone who is like everyone else? What's glorious about someone who does wrong?

(Sirach 13:5) 
The just will be glorified over the wicked. The proud and the sinner are to be hated.

(Sirach 13:6) 
From the beginning, God created man from the earth and will return him to it again.

(Sirach 13:7) 
The days of mankind are numbered, and their time is brief.

(Sirach 13:8) 
Man is like a vessel formed by a potter, and he will end up in the potter's hands.

(Sirach 13:9) 
Every man is made of the earth, and from the earth he was taken.

(Sirach 13:10) 
Why then be so troubled? There is nothing more troubling than man, who is made of the earth.

(Sirach 13:11) 
Why be proud? What is man but decay and ash?

(Sirach 13:12) 
The doctor is saddened by the length of the sickness, and the king of today will die tomorrow.

(Sirach 13:13) 
Man, why be proud? Why do evil things?

(Sirach 13:14) 
In sickness and destruction is every man; and from the beast and the worm comes the soul of the sinner.

(Sirach 13:15) 
Pride is the beginning of sin; the one who finds it pours out overflowing anger.

(Sirach 13:16) 
Therefore, the Lord brought upon them terrible plagues and destroyed them utterly.

(Sirach 13:17) 
God has thrown down the thrones of the proud and will cast them out.

(Sirach 13:18) 
The root of pride is the hatred of men, and because of sin, it will destroy him.

(Sirach 13:19) 
The proud blasphemed God and cursed Him, and at the end, they suffered in pain.

(Sirach 13:20) 
But for those who fear God, all things are good; and for those who are in His fear, there is peace.

(Sirach 13:21) 
The soul of the fear of God seeks and tests its own righteousness.

(Sirach 13:22) 
He who fears God will prepare his heart and sanctify his soul in the sight of God.

(Sirach 13:23) 
He who fears God observes His commandments, and he will prepare patience in his fear.

(Sirach 13:24) 
He who fears God seeks his will, and those who love Him will fulfill it.

(Sirach 13:25) 
He who fears God prepares his heart, and he is humbled in His sight.

(Sirach 13:26) 
Let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of men, because His mercy is great.

(Sirach 14:1) 
The one who reveres God will do good works, and through doing those works, he will be forgiven for his sins.

(Sirach 14:2) 
The one who has self-control will endure with patience. In those who may sin, joy will remain.

(Sirach 14:3) 
The heart of the self-controlled man will consider good things and won't be corrupted in the judgment.

(Sirach 14:4) 
Happy is the man who perseveres in good things, and not in evil.

(Sirach 14:5) 
A bad man is not found in the temptations that beset good men, and wisdom is not pleasing to a sinful man.

(Sirach 14:6) 
The wise man is in the word of wisdom, and the just man stands firm like the sun.

(Sirach 14:7) 
The counsel of an evil heart is a heavy burden, and his mind exasperates those around him.

(Sirach 14:8) 
Wickedness is accepted by the wicked man, and he is not cleansed, because God has taken away his fear.

(Sirach 14:9) 
The wise heart is understood in the words of wisdom, and as night in day, so is a foolish man in understanding.

(Sirach 14:10) 
You shall not grieve the heart of a just man, because he judges, and does not hate a sinful man.

(Sirach 14:11) 
Turn your soul away from sin, and correct iniquity a little.

(Sirach 14:12) 
Give alms from your possessions, and do not turn your face away from the poor.

(Sirach 14:13) 
Turn away your face from the poor, and he will not turn away his eyes from you.

(Sirach 14:14) 
In banquets, let your table be with you, and whatever is prepared, be first.

(Sirach 14:15) 
Be like a learned man who grabs what is prepared, and because of this, do not eat too much.

(Sirach 14:16) 
If you are plentiful, do not be greedy, and if you are in the midst of those who are not, do not be imprudent.

(Sirach 14:17) 
Moderation is good in fullness, and sleeplessness causes sorrow.

(Sirach 14:18) 
Sleep is quiet in a cold land, and the mediocre man will eat and be satisfied.

(Sirach 14:19) 
The wise man has heeded the words of wisdom, and has approved them, and the one who is sensible praises them.

(Sirach 14:20) 
The wise man and the one who has learned in the doctrine of wisdom will encounter wisdom, but the one who is foolish does not remain in it.

(Sirach 14:21) 
The understanding of the fool is like the wheel of a chariot, and is like a strong impulse in judgement.

(Sirach 14:22) 
Son, do not work too much, and if you want to multiply yourself, you will not be just.

(Sirach 14:23) 
If you are great, you will be humbled in yourself, and before God, you will find grace.

(Sirach 14:24) 
Search in secret, and you will find, and in the things that you seek, you will be filled.

(Sirach 14:25) 
For you do not need many labors if you have searched.

(Sirach 14:26) 
For many have been deceived in their own opinion, and an evil suspicion turns them away.

(Sirach 14:27) 
A hard heart has not succeeded, and the one who has despised it will be entangled in evil.

(Sirach 14:28) 
The one who perseveres in evil will accumulate sins.

(Sirach 14:29) 
Abstain from desires and do not do your own will, and abstain from pleasures.

(Sirach 14:30) 
If you give your soul to desires, it will make you a joy to your enemies.

(Sirach 14:31) 
Do not abound in delights and do not be joined to them.

(Sirach 14:32) 
Do not become poor from banquets with little expense.

(Sirach 15:1) 
Fear God, and you will do what He commands. Whoever loves God, will maintain his ways.

(Sirach 15:2) 
Those who have faith in God, will have eternal life. Those who love Him, will receive mercy.

(Sirach 15:3) 
To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The Lord will be with those who are faithful.

(Sirach 15:4) 
Wisdom and discipline are in the understanding of the righteous. The eye of the Lord is upon those who love Him.

(Sirach 15:5) 
Whoever fears God will do good, and those who are self-controlled will have the mercy of God.

(Sirach 15:6) 
Those who fear God will prepare their heart and soul before Him with humility.

(Sirach 15:7) 
Wisdom, truth, and the knowledge of the Law are in the hands of God. All the works of the Lord are done with faith.

(Sirach 15:8) 
Knowledge and understanding of the fear of God, is keeping His commandments.

(Sirach 15:9) 
God will not receive the sinner or regard the proud, for God is the judge of all.

(Sirach 15:10) 
God does not show favoritism, nor does he disregard the prayer of the poor.

(Sirach 15:11) 
He hears the prayer of the oppressed and will bring judgement on their oppressors.

(Sirach 15:12) 
God will not get tired of the prayers of the orphan or the widow when they pour out their complaints.

(Sirach 15:13) 
Do not the tears of the widow fall on the cheek, and does her cry fall on the one who caused them?

(Sirach 15:14) 
Whoever serves God will be received with kindness, and his prayer will reach to the clouds.

(Sirach 15:15) 
The prayer of the humble will pierce the clouds, and it will not depart until God has considered it.

(Sirach 15:16) 
It will not depart until the Most High has looked upon it, and will bring righteous judgment, and will consider it.

(Sirach 15:17) 
And it will not delay until He has finished the judgment.

(Sirach 15:18) 
Cursed is he who rejects God, whose heart is greedy, and those who blaspheme will not be justified.

(Sirach 15:19) 
Those who abound in evils, will be reserved for evil, and their sins will not be hidden.

(Sirach 15:20) 
The deliverance of those who fear God, and the hope of those who know Him.

(Sirach 15:21) 
Whoever fears the Lord will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, because He Himself is their hope.

(Sirach 15:22) 
To fear the Lord is life, and those who have it, will rest in the night.

(Sirach 15:23) 
The fear of the Lord is the desired crown of rejoicing, making joy and the day of exultation.

(Sirach 15:24) 
To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom, and its branches are of long life.

(Sirach 15:25) 
To fear the Lord drives away sins. Whoever has it, will turn away from all anger.

(Sirach 15:26) 
He who is without fear will not be justified, for the anger of his disturbance will destroy him.

(Sirach 15:27) 
He who is patient will sustain until the end, and after that, joy will be given to him.

(Sirach 15:28) 
It is good to hide iniquity, and those who have good grace will recount the just deeds.

(Sirach 15:29) 
It is good to control the tongue and to not have been experienced in grief.

(Sirach 16:1) 
All wisdom comes from the Lord God. God has had wisdom always, and for all time before the world began.

(Sirach 16:2) 
Who can count the sand of the sea, the raindrops, or the days of eternity?

(Sirach 16:3) 
Who can understand the height of the sky, the width of the earth, or the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 16:4) 
Wisdom was created before all things, and prudence has existed eternally.

(Sirach 16:5) 
The word of God in the highest heavens is the source of wisdom, and His paths are the eternal commandments.

(Sirach 16:6) 
To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? Who has known His knowledge?

(Sirach 16:7) 
There is only one Most High, the almighty Creator, a powerful king, greatly to be feared, sitting on His throne, and ruling.

(Sirach 16:8) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit. He saw, numbered, and measured wisdom.

(Sirach 16:9) 
And He poured out wisdom on all His works, and on all mankind, according to His gift. He gave wisdom to those who love Him.

(Sirach 16:10) 
Fear of the Lord is glory, boasting, joy, and a crown of exultation.

(Sirach 16:11) 
Fear of the Lord delights the heart and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 16:12) 
It will be well for those who fear God in their final days, and they will be blessed on the day of their completion.

(Sirach 16:13) 
The beginning of the fear of God is justification, and it exists with the faithful from birth.

(Sirach 16:14) 
Wisdom is the treasure of knowledge and of the works of the just, but the sacrifice of the wicked is abominable to God.

(Sirach 16:15) 
The offering of unjust gifts is defiled, and the sins of the wicked are not pleasing.

(Sirach 16:16) 
The Lord is the judge and does not accept persons.

(Sirach 16:17) 
He does not accept anyone against the poor, and He will hear the prayer of the injured.

(Sirach 16:18) 
Do not despise the groaning of the poor, and do not be annoyed by the prayers of the widow.

(Sirach 16:19) 
The tears of a widow fall on her cheeks, and she cries out against him who caused them.

(Sirach 16:20) 
He who serves God is acceptable, and his prayer reaches even to the clouds.

(Sirach 16:21) 
A humble prayer passes through the clouds until it arrives, and it will not depart until the Most High looks upon it,

(Sirach 16:22) 
and He will judge the just and will perform judgment and hear it.

(Sirach 16:23) 
And He will not delay, nor will He endure until He has completed it.

(Sirach 16:24) 
For the Lord is the judge, and there is no favoritism in judgment.

(Sirach 16:25) 
He will not accept anyone against the poor, because He hears the prayer of the oppressed.

(Sirach 16:26) 
And He will not despise the supplication of the orphan, nor will He be saddened by the groaning of the widow.

(Sirach 16:27) 
Do not the widow’s cheeks flow with tears, and her cries against him who caused them?

(Sirach 16:28) 
For he who serves God will be received kindly, and his requests will be placated even to the clouds.

(Sirach 16:29) 
A humble prayer passes through regions, until it arrives, and it will not depart until the Most High looks upon it,

(Sirach 16:30) 
and He will judge the just, and He will perform judgment, and He will bring forth judgment.

(Sirach 17:1) 
The Lord fashioned man out of the earth, and made him according to His own image.

(Sirach 17:2) 
He gave man dominion over himself, over his mind, and over his body.

(Sirach 17:3) 
God made man to be awestruck before Him, and gave man a duty to love and serve God.

(Sirach 17:4) 
Man was made so that he might come to know God's infinite greatness.

(Sirach 17:5) 
He filled man's eyes with understanding, so that man could see God's plan, and he showed him the knowledge of understanding.

(Sirach 17:6) 
He gave man knowledge of his mind, and showed him His glory.

(Sirach 17:7) 
He put understanding into man's eyes, and showed him the greatness of His works.

(Sirach 17:8) 
And He made their works glorious forever.

(Sirach 17:9) 
He made an eternal covenant with them, and showed them His justice.

(Sirach 17:10) 
His mercy is upon all flesh.

(Sirach 17:11) 
He pours out His mercy over all the earth.

(Sirach 17:12) 
God sent man on a mission, and he was given dominion over all things.

(Sirach 17:13) 
And He gave man power over his own soul.

(Sirach 17:14) 
He gave man the duty to love God with fear and trembling.

(Sirach 17:15) 
He gave man the duty to love his neighbor, and to understand his own sin.

(Sirach 17:16) 
The generations of men are like the green leaves, and the leaves of a tree, which fall off, and another falls.

(Sirach 17:17) 
Thus also is the generation of flesh and blood. One man is born from a woman, another man dies.

(Sirach 17:18) 
Every work of man is corrupted, and their works follow them.

(Sirach 17:19) 
And it is like the work of a potter.

(Sirach 17:20) 
So also the just and the wicked.

(Sirach 17:21) 
What is above the sun? And what is above the light? And what is above life? And what is above death?

(Sirach 17:22) 
All these things come from the earth.

(Sirach 17:23) 
For the earth was created out of the earth, and the just man comes from the wicked.

(Sirach 17:24) 
But all things shall be blessed in the Lord.

(Sirach 17:25) 
The days of man's life are numbered, but the days of Israel are without number.

(Sirach 17:26) 
For who will declare the great things of God? And who will announce His works?

(Sirach 17:27) 
For who can measure His greatness?

(Sirach 17:28) 
What is more precious than gold? For all things that are made of gold are good.

(Sirach 17:29) 
And what is sweeter than honey? And what is better than honey?

(Sirach 17:30) 
But wisdom and discipline are better than gold.

(Sirach 17:31) 
And as wisdom and doctrine direct life, so also is the mercy of God upon the just man.

(Sirach 17:32) 
He who gives doctrine gives also glory.

(Sirach 17:33) 
Keep justice, and preserve yourself, and you shall be justified.

(Sirach 17:34) 
And keep your faith, and you shall remain.

(Sirach 18:1) 
The one who reverences God will act well. The one who holds onto justice will fully understand it, and will be embraced by it as if it were his mother.

(Sirach 18:2) 
He will be nourished by the food of justice, and drink from the waters of life.

(Sirach 18:3) 
In the fear of the Lord is knowledge and discipline. Those who act accordingly will receive an inheritance with the just.

(Sirach 18:4) 
Do not desire the works of the wicked, but instead love the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 18:5) 
Do not be distressed, and do not be afraid. Do not associate with those people.

(Sirach 18:6) 
Love God with your whole heart, and whoever clings to Him will become like Him.

(Sirach 18:7) 
The reverence of the Lord is an honor, glory, joy, and a crown of exultation.

(Sirach 18:8) 
If you choose the fear of God, you will be delighted in them. Those who love Him will be sanctified in life.

(Sirach 18:9) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 18:10) 
Those who fear the Lord keep His commandments and will be patient in Him.

(Sirach 18:11) 
They will say, "We will prepare our hearts and sanctify ourselves, because after this, we will be justified."

(Sirach 18:12) 
Those who fear the Lord will find mercy and will be justified in judgment.

(Sirach 18:13) 
Those who fear the Lord will hope in Him, and those who love Him will remain in Him.

(Sirach 18:14) 
Those who fear the Lord will seek what pleases Him. Those who love Him will fulfill His laws.

(Sirach 18:15) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in the sight of the Most High.

(Sirach 18:16) 
Those who fear the Lord will obey His commandments and will have patience. Those who trust in Him will not fail.

(Sirach 18:17) 
Woe to the double-hearted, to impure lips, to hands that do evil, and to the sinner walking on two paths.

(Sirach 18:18) 
Woe to the timid heart, because it does not believe and therefore will not be protected.

(Sirach 18:19) 
Woe to the one who loses patience, turns away from the right paths, and ascends the perverse ways.

(Sirach 18:20) 
What will those who fear God do? Those who keep His laws will have life in them.

(Sirach 18:21) 
Those who fear Him will prepare their hearts and humble their souls in His sight.

(Sirach 18:22) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and in judgment, God will visit them.

(Sirach 19:1) 
Whoever scorns small things will fall little by little.

(Sirach 19:2) 
A judge who understands justice will take away the glory of the wicked and will turn away from the evildoers, thus judging them.

(Sirach 19:3) 
Fire and a violent wind are the agents of destruction, as is famine.

(Sirach 19:4) 
It is better to fall into the hands of the wicked, not into their deceits, for their deceit is more dangerous than their malice.

(Sirach 19:5) 
Every human being is like grass, and their glory is like the flowers of the field.

(Sirach 19:6) 
They wither and fall like grass, and the flower falls from the stem.

(Sirach 19:7) 
Do not make promises before you are judged, and do not speak before you have understood.

(Sirach 19:8) 
Do not answer a wicked person according to their wickedness, lest you become like them.

(Sirach 19:9) 
Speak well to the good, so that you will not be reproached for your words.

(Sirach 19:10) 
Do not say, “I will take vengeance on the wicked.” Instead, trust in the Lord, and He will help you.

(Sirach 19:11) 
Do good to your neighbor, and remember to fear the Lord.

(Sirach 19:12) 
Remember your death and cease from wickedness. Remember the commandments, and do not be puffed up in malice.

(Sirach 19:13) 
Whoever humbles themselves will be found wise, and whoever hides evil will conceal iniquity.

(Sirach 19:14) 
Whoever is silent will be honored with wisdom.

(Sirach 19:15) 
Fire tests gold and silver, and people are tested in the furnace of humility.

(Sirach 19:16) 
Trust in God, and He will help you; direct your way and hope in Him.

(Sirach 19:17) 
Whoever fears God will not tremble or be afraid, because God is their hope.

(Sirach 19:18) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 19:19) 
Whoever seeks the fear of God will obtain prudence, and whoever looks to Him will find a blessing.

(Sirach 19:20) 
Whoever fears God will be blessed in the end, and will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 19:21) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of God, and through that, they will be justified with the saints.

(Sirach 19:22) 
Whoever fears God will receive honor; they will be honored in the sight of men and in the sight of God Himself.

(Sirach 19:23) 
Whoever fears God will persevere in His will and, with patience, will be like a mother.

(Sirach 19:24) 
Whoever fears God loves Him, and whoever loves Him will be glorified.

(Sirach 19:25) 
The Spirit of the fear of God created all things, and all things were created for the sake of fear.

(Sirach 19:26) 
Blessed is the one who fears God and keeps His ways.

(Sirach 19:27) 
Because God, looking upon those who fear Him, will bless them.

(Sirach 19:28) 
God will bless and visit the soul that fears Him and will receive it on the day of its death.

(Sirach 19:29) 
The fear of God is the beginning of His love, and faith is the beginning of clinging to Him.

(Sirach 19:30) 
They hold discipline, protection, and patience within themselves, and those who do not have these are forsaken.

(Sirach 19:31) 
The life of sinners is short, and the wicked will quickly be taken away.

(Sirach 19:32) 
Whoever is afflicted hastens to evil, and whoever is joyful in heart hastens to evil.

(Sirach 19:33) 
The abominations of the heart, the unrest, and the anger of a wicked man are all abominations.

(Sirach 19:34) 
A just man endures until the appointed time, and at the end, he will have joy.

(Sirach 19:35) 
A good man hides evil, and the enemy of the hateful will uncover his ways.

(Sirach 19:36) 
In the understanding of a prudent man, the words of wisdom are known, and the righteous will receive them.

(Sirach 19:37) 
The words of wisdom are like rivers of water; the source of justice is everlasting.

(Sirach 19:38) 
A fool, like a ship tossed about by the waves, does not know how to steer.

(Sirach 19:39) 
The wise man, like a good helmsman, meditates on the fear of the Lord, directs his steps, and is always in His law.

(Sirach 19:40) 
Every human being upon the earth is as they were created, just a human.

(Sirach 20:1) 
Those who are studious of the law of the Most High will acquire it, and those who act by it will be glorified.

(Sirach 20:2) 
Those who are taught by the law will find something to respond with; those who act by it will find the words they need to respond.

(Sirach 20:3) 
Those who love the law love life, and those who rise early to learn it will be filled with joy.

(Sirach 20:4) 
Those who hold fast to the law will inherit it; whoever passes through it will inherit eternal life.

(Sirach 20:5) 
Those who turn toward the law will dwell in it, and those who love it will walk in its ways.

(Sirach 20:6) 
Those who believe in the law will inherit it; those who trust in it will possess it.

(Sirach 20:7) 
Evil begins when you are separated from the law; those who withdraw from God will hate it.

(Sirach 20:8) 
The thoughts of wicked people are like the wind or like a ship passing through waves.

(Sirach 20:9) 
Like a ship's path through water, they pass by, and their path is not found, nor is there any sign of their passing in the waves.

(Sirach 20:10) 
So too, the wicked person will not be found when they die. They will be turned to nothing and scattered like dust.

(Sirach 20:11) 
Their memory is erased, and their life passes like a cloud, like a mist scattered by the sun.

(Sirach 20:12) 
Those who abandon the law and do not know it fall into evil; those who hold to it are loved by God.

(Sirach 20:13) 
Wisdom meets them like a mother, and receives them like a young wife.

(Sirach 20:14) 
Wisdom feeds them with the bread of understanding and gives them to drink from the waters of wisdom.

(Sirach 20:15) 
Wisdom establishes and strengthens them, so they will not be shaken. It confirms them.

(Sirach 20:16) 
Then Wisdom tests them and finds them worthy.

(Sirach 20:17) 
Like fire refining gold, Wisdom tests them, and examines them in the vessel of temptation.

(Sirach 20:18) 
Until a set time, they will be established and proven like gold in a furnace.

(Sirach 20:19) 
In the time of their visitation, they will shine and will run like sparks through the reeds.

(Sirach 20:20) 
They will judge the nations and rule the peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever.

(Sirach 21:1) 
My son, if you want to serve God, prepare yourself for the trials that come with it.

(Sirach 21:2) 
Keep your heart on the right path, be steady in your faith, and do not be in a hurry when trouble comes.

(Sirach 21:3) 
Cling to Him, and do not leave, so that you may grow at the end.

(Sirach 21:4) 
Accept everything that comes to you, and endure it in sorrow. Be patient in your humility.

(Sirach 21:5) 
Because gold is tested in fire, and righteous men are tested in the furnace of suffering.

(Sirach 21:6) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you. Make straight your ways, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 21:7) 
He who fears God will not tremble or be afraid, because God is his hope.

(Sirach 21:8) 
Blessed is the soul of the one who fears God.

(Sirach 21:9) 
All of this comes from fearing God. And who clings to it, with whom will he be glorified?

(Sirach 21:10) 
All flesh will choose the fear of God and the keeping of the commandments.

(Sirach 21:11) 
The Lord's commandments are good, and they make the heart rejoice, and they enlighten the eyes.

(Sirach 21:12) 
The fear of the Lord sanctifies the heart, and gives joy, and gladness, and a long life.

(Sirach 21:13) 
He who fears God will be well in the end, and will be blessed on the day of his death.

(Sirach 21:14) 
The beginning of the fear of God is to fear God. And when it is established in faith, he will be magnified in glory.

(Sirach 21:15) 
From the fear of God, all iniquity will depart.

(Sirach 21:16) 
He who does not fear God cannot be justified, for the wrath of his heart will destroy him.

(Sirach 21:17) 
Patience in time will console you, and again will bring joy to him.

(Sirach 21:18) 
His thoughts are like the vessels of a potter. In due time, He will visit them.

(Sirach 21:19) 
He who fears God will never be sad.

(Sirach 21:20) 
He who hopes in God will not be ashamed.

(Sirach 21:21) 
A good spirit in poverty is better than gold.

(Sirach 21:22) 
It is better to live with a foolish man, than to live with a quarrelsome woman.

(Sirach 21:23) 
The impious man does his own will in his days, but the chosen one will endure until the end.

(Sirach 21:24) 
A prudent heart will know the time and judgment. Both in the matters of sinners and in their faults.

(Sirach 21:25) 
Every way will be far from the wicked, but the just man knows the way.

(Sirach 21:26) 
He who loves justice, loves life, and he who hates reproof is foolish.

(Sirach 22:1) 
The one who reveres God will do good things, and the one who holds fast to what is right will obtain goodness.

(Sirach 22:2) 
The one who knows goodness keeps it safe. And the one who loves goodness will have life.

(Sirach 22:3) 
The one who holds fast to goodness will inherit it, and the one who rejects goodness will perish.

(Sirach 22:4) 
Reverence for the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and it is made firm with the faithful in their mother's womb.

(Sirach 22:5) 
Wisdom strengthens faith with all people, and the good will be compared with the elect and the righteous.

(Sirach 22:6) 
The one who reveres God will have what is good, and his hope is like good fruit.

(Sirach 22:7) 
The one who reveres God will do well, and his deeds will be compared with his state.

(Sirach 22:8) 
God will bring justice to those who revere Him, and He will visit them in His sight.

(Sirach 22:9) 
The one who reveres the Lord prepares his heart and sanctifies his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 22:10) 
The one who reveres the Lord keeps His commandments and will have patience until He is seen.

(Sirach 22:11) 
Saying, "If you do not believe, go away from Me." And for the one who boasts in Him, it is made clear to him.

(Sirach 22:12) 
The one who reveres the Lord reveres friendship, because the friend is like him.

(Sirach 22:13) 
Son, revere God with all your soul, and love His priests.

(Sirach 22:14) 
Love Him with all your strength, and do not abandon His ministers.

(Sirach 22:15) 
Seek the reverence of God and live in righteousness, and you will obtain it, and be crowned on the day of His visitation.

(Sirach 22:16) 
Everyone who reveres God hopes in Him, and the one who holds to Him will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 22:17) 
The one who reveres God will fear nothing, and he will not be afraid, for He is his hope.

(Sirach 22:18) 
Blessed is the soul that reveres God.

(Sirach 22:19) 
For to whom? And whose is the glory? And who is glorious? The one who reveres God.

(Sirach 22:20) 
Reverence for the Lord is the beginning of His love, and faith is the beginning of adhering to Him.

(Sirach 22:21) 
Seek contrition of heart and humility, and He will be merciful to you in the day of tribulation.

(Sirach 22:22) 
The one who reveres the Lord will do good things, and the one who holds fast to what is right will hear his prayers.

(Sirach 22:23) 
Just as water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 22:24) 
The merciful will make atonement for sins.

(Sirach 22:25) 
Do not be afraid to die for the truth, and God will fight for you.

(Sirach 22:26) 
Do not be quick with your tongue, and do not be negligent and careless in your works.

(Sirach 22:27) 
Do not be like a lion in your house, overturning your household and terrifying them.

(Sirach 22:28) 
Do not let your hand be extended to receive, and contract it when giving.

(Sirach 23:1) 
Lord, Father, and Master of my life, don't let me be corrupted by the plans of other men.

(Sirach 23:2) 
Don't give me the pride of life in my eyes, and don't let my desires control me. Turn my face away from worldly desires.

(Sirach 23:3) 
Don't let me be consumed by the lusts of the flesh, the pleasures of the world, or the desires of the tongue.

(Sirach 23:4) 
Keep evil far from me. Protect me from lies. Give me neither poverty nor wealth: give me only the necessities, lest, if I have too much, I become a wicked man.

(Sirach 23:5) 
If I am full, I may forget you and say, "Who is the Lord?" Or, if I am forced by poverty, I may steal and ruin the name of my God.

(Sirach 23:6) 
Don’t reveal the crimes of a servant to his master, because the servant is aware of his own crimes.

(Sirach 23:7) 
Because a wicked servant hates his master, and this hatred is within him.

(Sirach 23:8) 
I would rather be the servant of a good master than a bad master, and I should not hate what is good.

(Sirach 23:9) 
From my youth I have learned, and even now I seek truth.

(Sirach 23:10) 
I have reached the fulfillment through truth, and my heart takes delight in it.

(Sirach 23:11) 
I sought truth from the beginning, and I have found it through its manifestation.

(Sirach 23:12) 
I have sought truth through labor, and in my works I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:13) 
My hands labored for truth, and I have seen many good things through it.

(Sirach 23:14) 
My tongue has confessed the truth, and the glory of the truth is that it is manifest.

(Sirach 23:15) 
I am still young, and before I depart this life, I have sought truth openly.

(Sirach 23:16) 
I continue to seek truth, and I will not tire until I find it.

(Sirach 23:17) 
My heart has been saddened, and in my confusion I have studied it.

(Sirach 23:18) 
I have opened my hand to truth, and I have been blessed by it, because I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:19) 
I have laid down my soul in truth, and I have guarded it with knowledge.

(Sirach 23:20) 
I received peace of heart with truth, and I have lived with it.

(Sirach 23:21) 
The Lord has exalted me, and because of this I will glorify truth.

(Sirach 23:22) 
After my confusion, truth has given me a good reward.

(Sirach 23:23) 
My heart has drawn near to truth: and I have acted in accordance with it.

(Sirach 23:24) 
May God give me my reward.

(Sirach 23:25) 
Give, and you will receive.

(Sirach 23:26) 
Love your neighbor, and do not trust your enemy.

(Sirach 24:1) 
The wisdom of God raises up those who are humble, and delivers them from the evils of the world.

(Sirach 24:2) 
My heart is made firm in the Lord, and I speak with honor in His presence.

(Sirach 24:3) 
Great are the works of the Lord, all of which are sought after by those who love Him.

(Sirach 24:4) 
Those who love God will love Him; and those who love Him will seek His will.

(Sirach 24:5) 
He who believes in Him will inherit life, and the just will possess it.

(Sirach 24:6) 
Prepare your heart, and consider His ways.

(Sirach 24:7) 
For those who do His works, will be saved.

(Sirach 24:8) 
He who loves the Lord loves His Son, and whoever obeys Him will love Him.

(Sirach 24:9) 
For this, I will visit all nations, and each one according to his works.

(Sirach 24:10) 
For as He commanded me to do, so it has been done.

(Sirach 24:11) 
I came forth like a river from a river, and like a great wave near the sea.

(Sirach 24:12) 
Therefore, I will still pour out doctrine like flowing water, and I will reveal it like a mirror, and like an image.

(Sirach 24:13) 
I will say: I will teach doctrine still in the morning, and I will illuminate it until the light.

(Sirach 24:14) 
I will pour out doctrine like a fortification of water, like prophecy, and like an eternal testament.

(Sirach 24:15) 
The gentiles will see still and they will know that those who are in need of God will not be lacking.

(Sirach 24:16) 
The Lord is great, and exalted, and His power is forever.

(Sirach 24:17) 
It is not amazing to work in His works, and who will investigate His works?

(Sirach 24:18) 
Who will recount the strength of His glory, and who will dare to speak of His marvelous works?

(Sirach 24:19) 
Wisdom precedes all of these things and His understanding is from eternity.

(Sirach 24:20) 
The root of wisdom—to whom has it been revealed? And who has known His prudence?

(Sirach 24:21) 
There is only one Most High, the omnipotent Creator, the powerful king, and greatly feared, who sits upon His throne, and reigns.

(Sirach 24:22) 
The Creator created her in the Holy Spirit, and saw her, and numbered, and measured her.

(Sirach 24:23) 
And He poured her out over all His works, and over all flesh according to His gift, and especially over those who love Him.

(Sirach 24:24) 
The fear of the Lord is glory, and boasting, and joy, and the crown of exultation. The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives joy, and gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 24:25) 
It is good for those who fear God, both in the end times, and in the day of their death they will be blessed.

(Sirach 24:26) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the election of wisdom and with the holy faithful it will be born with fear.

(Sirach 24:27) 
The fear of God is the fullness of wisdom, and fills its fruits.

(Sirach 24:28) 
It will fill His entire house with good things, and His treasures with fruits.

(Sirach 24:29) 
The crown of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; filling peace and the fruit of salvation.

(Sirach 24:30) 
Both God sent, knowledge and understanding of glory, and exalts the glory of those who hold to it.

(Sirach 24:31) 
The root of wisdom is fearing God; and its branches are life.

(Sirach 24:32) 
The treasure of wisdom is fearing God.

(Sirach 24:33) 
Wisdom and the discipline of justice, and love, are guardians.

(Sirach 24:34) 
The works of His commandments are life, and in His faith, like light.

(Sirach 24:35) 
There is no lie in it, but its faith remains forever.

(Sirach 24:36) 
Lies and vanity are for foolish men; but wisdom, like a river in its fullness, is for the prudent, and remains like a testament in them.

(Sirach 24:37) 
The gentiles did not believe in it, and did not know its ways, nor did they hear it.

(Sirach 24:38) 
But they who fear God have known it.

(Sirach 24:39) 
For that is life, and is found in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 24:40) 
And its beginning is to please God, and its love is the keeping of His laws.

(Sirach 24:41) 
The discipline of His commandments is the love of life: and His works are love.

(Sirach 24:42) 
So that we may rejoice in the things that we do, and walk with fear of Him, and walk in His ways.

(Sirach 25:1) 
The person who has reverence for God will do good things, and anyone who clings to justice will grasp it, and it will fill them completely like a vessel.

(Sirach 25:2) 
And it will greet them like a mother greets her children, embracing them as a wife embraces her husband.

(Sirach 25:3) 
It will feed them with the bread of life and understanding, and will give them to drink of the life-giving water of wisdom.

(Sirach 25:4) 
They will be strengthened by justice and will not be shaken, they will trust in it, and they will not be humiliated.

(Sirach 25:5) 
It will exalt them above their neighbor, and in the midst of the assembly, it will open their mouth.

(Sirach 25:6) 
Joy, a crown, and honor will be given to them forever.

(Sirach 25:7) 
But the wicked will not receive wisdom, nor will they remain in it, and they will not be able to grasp it.

(Sirach 25:8) 
For they are like a stone, a test to them: and they will stumble over that stone, and it will cast them away.

(Sirach 25:9) 
For wisdom is like a name to them; and they have not known it.

(Sirach 25:10) 
For it is better not to know wisdom than to know it and not to recognize its power.

(Sirach 25:11) 
For it is better for a person who does not know wisdom to walk along the road, than to know it and turn away from the road.

(Sirach 25:12) 
What is iniquity, except the death of sinners? Or what is evil, but to turn away from God?

(Sirach 25:13) 
For what creature on earth is better than a human being? Or what is a greater sense within a human being?

(Sirach 25:14) 
All flesh grows old like a garment: for the days of the world are the days of the good.

(Sirach 25:15) 
Like leaves in the springtime: some fall, others come forth. So also generations of flesh and blood, one dies, and another is born.

(Sirach 25:16) 
Every corruptible work will have an end, and the person who does that work will go with it.

(Sirach 25:17) 
For it is good above all things to love God: for whoever loves Him will have life.

(Sirach 25:18) 
Whoever fears God will consider all things, and will remain in patience.

(Sirach 25:19) 
Every temptation and tribulation will come upon them.

(Sirach 25:20) 
And whoever fears God will keep the commandments, and will direct the paths of their heart.

(Sirach 25:21) 
They will believe in his word, and will trust in him as in a father.

(Sirach 25:22) 
All fear of the Lord is fear, and in all justice there is wisdom.

(Sirach 25:23) 
But the one who does not fear God cannot be justified, because his wrath is his disturbance.

(Sirach 25:24) 
All mercy will make a place for each person according to the merits of their works.

(Sirach 25:25) 
The person who offers a sacrifice from iniquity, defiles the sacrifice: and the gifts of the unjust are not approved.

(Sirach 25:26) 
The Most High does not look at the gifts of the wicked, nor will He be propitiated for sins in the multitude of their sacrifices.

(Sirach 25:27) 
The person who offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who slaughters a son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 25:28) 
The bread of the needy is the life of the poor: the one who defrauds them is a person of blood.

(Sirach 25:29) 
The one who takes away the life of their neighbor kills them: and the one who defrauds a hired worker is a person of blood.

(Sirach 25:30) 
The wicked build and then destroy: and when they plant, they uproot.

(Sirach 25:31) 
The giver and the receiver look upon their labor.

(Sirach 25:32) 
What is the use of humility to the one who fasts and does not fulfill the commands of God?

(Sirach 25:33) 
What is the use if the person prays and does not keep the commandments?

(Sirach 26:1) 
Whoever reveres God will do good deeds. And the one who endures in justice will understand it and be enlightened like light.

(Sirach 26:2) 
Whoever reveres God will have good things and a good reputation, just like pleasing incense.

(Sirach 26:3) 
Whoever reveres God will be well-regarded and will honor his parents, like a mother.

(Sirach 26:4) 
In reverence of God is his life and hope, and it will never pass away.

(Sirach 26:5) 
Whoever reveres God will have no fear, nor will he be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 26:6) 
Blessed is the soul of the one who reveres God.

(Sirach 26:7) 
For in the visitation of God, he will be saved.

(Sirach 26:8) 
Whoever reveres God hopes in Him, and the just will not be lacking in His hope.

(Sirach 26:9) 
Whoever reveres God hates sins, and the one who commits injustice will atone for his sins.

(Sirach 26:10) 
A wicked man does not persevere in his wicked desires.

(Sirach 26:11) 
Because God finds wickedness hateful, wickedness will not be hidden from Him.

(Sirach 26:12) 
But a just man will do good works and will fulfill the commandments of God.

(Sirach 26:13) 
And he will know that God is his, and he will remain in His counsel and reverence.

(Sirach 26:14) 
Whoever reveres God prepares his heart and humbles his soul in the sight of God.

(Sirach 26:15) 
We fall into the hands of God and not into the hands of men.

(Sirach 26:16) 
For according to His greatness is also His mercy; because as He is magnified, so also is His mercy.

(Sirach 26:17) 
Not everything belongs to men, but the mercy of God belongs to all things.

(Sirach 26:18) 
It is good to show mercy in the time of tribulation, like clouds of rain in the time of drought.

(Sirach 26:19) 
He who gives, offering in justice, will remember his sacrifice, and his glory will flourish.

(Sirach 26:20) 
For there is no better offering than mercy and almsgiving.

(Sirach 26:21) 
Mercy and almsgiving forgive sins.

(Sirach 26:22) 
He will turn away from iniquity, and God will turn away because of iniquity.

(Sirach 26:23) 
He will not judge the person of the poor, and he will hear the prayers of those in distress.

(Sirach 26:24) 
He will prepare his heart in God and his prayers as if building with stones.

(Sirach 26:25) 
A fool is like a craftsman who cuts useless things, and so too is the one who is foolish like a man who scatters.

(Sirach 26:26) 
A son who sins but has sense is better than a son of the just who has custom.

(Sirach 26:27) 
A wise man and a knowing heart are better than a foolish man and a fool.

(Sirach 26:28) 
One who is moderate and has sense is better than one who seeks greatness and lacks it.

(Sirach 26:29) 
In all your work, consider your last things, and you will not sin for eternity.

(Sirach 26:30) 
Do not err in your substance, and do not go on the ways in which you sin.

(Sirach 27:1) 
Those who love mercy, love God, and those who hold it, will be filled with grace.

(Sirach 27:2) 
Those who love fear, will be great, and those who keep it, will be like the very roots of a tree.

(Sirach 27:3) 
Fear is the beginning of Wisdom: and glory is in the fear of God, and hope and strength is in Him.

(Sirach 27:4) 
He who fears God will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, for he is the hope of that person.

(Sirach 27:5) 
The soul of the person who fears God is blessed, with joy and consolation.

(Sirach 27:6) 
He who fears God, it will be well with him at the end: and on the day of his death he will be blessed.

(Sirach 27:7) 
The enemy of the fear of God, will not be justified: for his zeal will destroy him.

(Sirach 27:8) 
A wise man will be recognized in his words, and a sensible man will be proven in his works.

(Sirach 27:9) 
A man's works will be proven, and as a fire tests the potter's vessel, so are just men tested in the trial of tribulation.

(Sirach 27:10) 
He who believes in God, attends to the commandments: and he who trusts in Him, will not fail.

(Sirach 27:11) 
He who fears the Lord will fear nothing, and will not be afraid, for He is his hope.

(Sirach 27:12) 
Blessed is the soul of the person who fears God, to whom and towards whom he looks.

(Sirach 27:13) 
The fear of God is the beginning of His love, but faith in Him is in good works.

(Sirach 27:14) 
To love Him fully, is to fear God and keep His commandments.

(Sirach 27:15) 
This is the sense of doctrine: for those who have seen Him, will remain in eternal life.

(Sirach 27:16) 
He who fears God, will prepare his heart, and in His sight will sanctify his soul.

(Sirach 27:17) 
He who fears God, keeps His commandments, and he who trusts in Him, will be heard.

(Sirach 27:18) 
For God seeks hearts and souls: and He works in love.

(Sirach 27:19) 
He who fears God, desires to please God, and he who loves Him, will fulfill His laws.

(Sirach 27:20) 
He who fears the Lord, will prepare his heart, and humble his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 27:21) 
Falling into the hands of men, we fall into the hands of God: and according to His mercy, so is His judgment.

(Sirach 27:22) 
Speak before the Lord, and say: "According to what is Your will for me, Lord, and teach me Your discipline."

(Sirach 27:23) 
And direct my eye toward your commandments, and give me your fear.

(Sirach 27:24) 
Show me what is good, and what pleases you: for it is good, and I will keep it.

(Sirach 27:25) 
Everything that is, You have put upon me: and I will be instructed in Your commandments.

(Sirach 27:26) 
For every operation is according to judgment: and because of this, You will not be glorified for eternity.

(Sirach 27:27) 
And after these things, all my works will live: and each in his time will be praised.

(Sirach 28:1) 
The one who wants vengeance will find vengeance from God, and the sinner will remember all his sins.

(Sirach 28:2) 
Forgive your neighbor who has wronged you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.

(Sirach 28:3) 
Does a man hold anger against another man, and then expect healing from God?

(Sirach 28:4) 
Does a man not have mercy on another man, and then pray for his own sins to be forgiven?

(Sirach 28:5) 
He himself, being flesh, holds anger; and does he pray for forgiveness for his own sins?

(Sirach 28:6) 
Remember your last days, and stop being angry; think about corruption and death, and you will keep the commandments.

(Sirach 28:7) 
Think about the commandments, and you will not be angry with your neighbor.

(Sirach 28:8) 
Remember the covenant with the Most High, and forgive the offense.

(Sirach 28:9) 
Avoid provocation, and you will lessen your sins.

(Sirach 28:10) 
Do not be unjustly angry with your neighbor, nor do anything to insult him.

(Sirach 28:11) 
Pride is hateful to God and men, and from both, those who have pride have iniquity.

(Sirach 28:12) 
Nations, kingdoms, and the rulers are all proud.

(Sirach 28:13) 
From the race of men comes the proud race: and from the nations, the proud nation, and the proud nation will be despised.

(Sirach 28:14) 
Like flowing waters, so are riches from the proud: and they overflow beyond themselves.

(Sirach 28:15) 
The one who abandons, and the one who is angry, and the one who perishes: but as for what is, and the one who is sad.

(Sirach 28:16) 
All things on earth are from dust, and the king comes from the same man.

(Sirach 28:17) 
Who is greater in his work, than he who loves?

(Sirach 28:18) 
Wisdom and strength, and riches, and poverty, and the fear of the Lord are all glory.

(Sirach 28:19) 
Better is the poor man in his state, and strong and healthy in his work, than the rich man infirm in body.

(Sirach 28:20) 
The health of the soul is above all gold, and a strong body is above infinite riches.

(Sirach 28:21) 
There is nothing better than the health of the body, beyond riches.

(Sirach 28:22) 
There is no pleasure beyond the joy of the heart: and there is no life beyond a healthy body.

(Sirach 28:23) 
Death is the worst name: above all good things, it is the best.

(Sirach 28:24) 
A blessed life will not be given to death, nor does the dead look back, to act toward the living.

(Sirach 28:25) 
The wise man is firm in his words, in his heart, like a mountain standing in its height.

(Sirach 28:26) 
A fool in his words, is like a ship tossed about in the sea.

(Sirach 28:27) 
The wise man is silent, until the time is right, like the signs of clouds in a time of wind.

(Sirach 28:28) 
The wise man will be silent until he sees the right time: but the fool and the coward do not observe the time.

(Sirach 28:29) 
He who has a heart, sorrows in words: and the prudent man is silent until the time.

(Sirach 28:30) 
The wise man in his words, will cover himself, and the prudent man in his heart, will be delighted.

(Sirach 28:31) 
He who speaks in word, will be hateful: and he who takes audacity upon himself, will find hatred.

(Sirach 29:1) 
Whoever helps their neighbor lends to God, and what is given to God profits the giver.

(Sirach 29:2) 
Give to the poor, and you shall not be found wanting. Don't turn your back on the poor, and God will not turn His back on you.

(Sirach 29:3) 
Do good for your neighbor, to the best of your ability, and accept gifts.

(Sirach 29:4) 
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today. Don't delay.

(Sirach 29:5) 
Don't say, “I'll seek and give tomorrow.” You do not know what tomorrow will bring.

(Sirach 29:6) 
The sinner prepares evil for an evil day, but the just will be delivered on the day of misfortune.

(Sirach 29:7) 
Don't look at the rich, the powerful, or the honorable, with envy.

(Sirach 29:8) 
Don’t look at anyone's face when judging unjustly.

(Sirach 29:9) 
Don’t plot evil against your neighbor, and don’t try to trick him.

(Sirach 29:10) 
God and all good people hate pride.

(Sirach 29:11) 
Both injustice and the one who commits it are detestable to God, and both will be punished by the sinner.

(Sirach 29:12) 
Don't return evil for evil, and don't answer an insult with an insult.

(Sirach 29:13) 
Flee the wicked man and his wickedness.

(Sirach 29:14) 
Uphold the just, and defend the innocent.

(Sirach 29:15) 
Don’t condemn the just along with the wicked, and don’t treat the wicked as just.

(Sirach 29:16) 
Show mercy to the just, and do what is right; then you will be confident in your righteousness.

(Sirach 29:17) 
Don't look at men's faces, and don't be afraid in judgment.

(Sirach 29:18) 
Do what is right to help the poor.

(Sirach 29:19) 
Don't let your tongue cause you to stumble, and don't block your own path.

(Sirach 29:20) 
Don’t be evil, and don't accept the favors of the powerful.

(Sirach 29:21) 
Don't hesitate to confess your sin, and don’t try to hide it.

(Sirach 29:22) 
Don't deny yourself before God and men, and don't be ashamed to admit your sin.

(Sirach 29:23) 
Don't say in your heart, “Because of my many gifts, I will hide my sins,” because God knows everything.

(Sirach 29:24) 
Don’t say, “Because of my many charitable deeds, God will give me mercy.”

(Sirach 29:25) 
Don't be afraid, because vengeance is not with God, nor will He be angry with you.

(Sirach 29:26) 
Be angry with your neighbor, but remember the Most High, and your anger will not be with you.

(Sirach 29:27) 
Remember your last days, and you will stop hating; corruption and death will remain in the commandments.

(Sirach 29:28) 
Remember the fear of God, and don’t be angry with your neighbor.

(Sirach 29:29) 
Remember the covenant of the Most High, and forgive your neighbor’s injuries.

(Sirach 29:30) 
Flee from lust, because death will pursue you.

(Sirach 29:31) 
Remember the commandments of the Lord, and don’t pay attention to the proud commands of men.

(Sirach 29:32) 
You will be justified on the day of your death, on the day of tribulation, and in the hour of retribution, the children of the wicked will turn against you.

(Sirach 29:33) 
Don't fear the proud in their thoughts, for the power of the wicked is like dust.

(Sirach 29:34) 
It is God who speaks, and He will destroy the proud. For who will touch and not fear?

(Sirach 29:35) 
And everyone who fears God and does His commandments is loved by Him.

(Sirach 29:36) 
Those who fear God trust Him, and those who cling to Him will not be shaken.

(Sirach 30:1) 
The one who loves a child will often discipline him, so that he may rejoice in the end.

(Sirach 30:2) 
The one who teaches his son will give joy, and will rejoice in him among his enemies.

(Sirach 30:3) 
The one who educates a fool is an enemy to himself; and the one who loves a fool will be saddened by him.

(Sirach 30:4) 
The one who believes fools acknowledges futility; and the one who trusts them will suffer harm.

(Sirach 30:5) 
The one who takes delight in wickedness gathers scandal for himself; and the one who hates corrections will have a diminished life.

(Sirach 30:6) 
The one who trusts in a fool is like himself; and the one who cannot resist temptation falls into evil.

(Sirach 30:7) 
There is no sorrow greater than sorrow, and sadness greater than sadness: the sorrow of riches and fools.

(Sirach 30:8) 
There is no wisdom in a man who works in vanity; and a foolish man amounts to nothing.

(Sirach 30:9) 
It is better to work and have sufficiency in all things, than to walk in idleness and be in need.

(Sirach 30:10) 
It is better to dwell in a solitary land than with a quarrelsome and angry woman.

(Sirach 30:11) 
It is better to work, and to have what is necessary, than to boast and be in need.

(Sirach 30:12) 
A wise man in his own affairs will be silent, as if sleeping; and he who sees, will reveal him.

(Sirach 30:13) 
It is better to hide one's folly than to hide wisdom.

(Sirach 30:14) 
It is miserable to have a foolish son; and the son of the wicked is without joy.

(Sirach 30:15) 
The one who fears God loves His commandments; and the one who keeps them will have life.

(Sirach 30:16) 
The one who fears God will receive instruction; and the one who watches over it, will be enlightened in the morning.

(Sirach 30:17) 
The one who seeks the law will be filled with it; and the one who is feigned in its ways will receive it.

(Sirach 30:18) 
The one who fears God will prepare his heart; and in His sight he humbles his soul.

(Sirach 30:19) 
The one who fears God keeps His commandments, and endures in patience as if in water.

(Sirach 30:20) 
This word is the beginning of the fear of God; and His sight, the test of the heart.

(Sirach 30:21) 
Every great plague and every small plague is upon the wicked; and the forgiveness of sins comes from God.

(Sirach 30:22) 
The one who offers gifts unjustly is like one who slaughters his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 30:23) 
The bread of the needy is the life of the poor; the one who withholds it is a man of blood.

(Sirach 30:24) 
The one who takes away bread by fraud is like the one who kills his neighbor.

(Sirach 30:25) 
The one who sheds blood and the one who commits fraud are brothers.

(Sirach 30:26) 
When you have built, and erected, what will remain for you? In time.

(Sirach 30:27) 
When you have gathered, and collected, what will remain for you? In time.

(Sirach 30:28) 
The one who is good in evils will not be considered good; and the wicked in good things will not be crowned.

(Sirach 30:29) 
The one who trusts in riches will rejoice, and the one who loves gifts will perish.

(Sirach 30:30) 
The one who detracts from friends, will perish; and the one who is impious will envy.

(Sirach 31:1) 
A rich man watching over his wealth is but a short sleep: a fool, though awake, is still dreaming.

(Sirach 31:2) 
A fool, even when awake, has nothing: he is always begging.

(Sirach 31:3) 
A foolish man's words are like a woman in labor.

(Sirach 31:4) 
The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel: it cannot retain any wisdom.

(Sirach 31:5) 
The wise man is full of speech, as if a river: and, like one ever thirsty, always has more to learn.

(Sirach 31:6) 
He that adds to his learning increases himself: but he that hates discipline shall die quickly.

(Sirach 31:7) 
A fool will act foolishly, and a wise man will bear it patiently.

(Sirach 31:8) 
The words of a fool are a burden on the road.

(Sirach 31:9) 
The mouth of a fool is like a herald of a banquet.

(Sirach 31:10) 
The mouth of fools quickly leads to sorrow.

(Sirach 31:11) 
The banquet of a sinner is not well-ordered.

(Sirach 31:12) 
A fool will not be steadfast in doctrine, but will pass away like a flower.

(Sirach 31:13) 
A foolish man is like a ruined house: and the understanding of the unwise is like a path unknown.

(Sirach 31:14) 
He that is untaught is like stones on the way.

(Sirach 31:15) 
The understanding of the unwise is like a weight on the road.

(Sirach 31:16) 
A wise man is like a life in learning: and he that despises it is like one about to die.

(Sirach 31:17) 
He that is good in word shall be filled with good things: and the fruit of his lips shall be fulfilled.

(Sirach 31:18) 
To glory in evil is foolishness: and a man of lies is like deep water.

(Sirach 31:19) 
Like stones in deep water, so are the hearts of the wicked: and as he that has despised God, so is their vengeance.

(Sirach 31:20) 
He that despises the law sins: and he that keeps the commandment shall be recompensed.

(Sirach 31:21) 
The grace of the Lord is like water in a dry land: and he that looks to mercy fulfills the commandments.

(Sirach 31:22) 
What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? And what is it? Seven times in the mouth of a fool.

(Sirach 31:23) 
Evil speech is in the mouth of the wicked: but in the mouth of the elect it shall please.

(Sirach 31:24) 
The heart of the wise man will think of parables: and the ear of the hearing desires wisdom.

(Sirach 31:25) 
The wise and the understanding man will beware of evil: and will dwell among the fools.

(Sirach 31:26) 
A fool will change like a wheel on a cart: and his thought is like a wheel in the sky.

(Sirach 31:27) 
A friend is like a horse, saying: "Upon which will you mount?"

(Sirach 31:28) 
Like a bird against the sun, so is the heart of the proud: and against the humble, as a sword turned.

(Sirach 31:29) 
The proud man loves destruction: and the proud man will not stand against evils.

(Sirach 31:30) 
In the heart of the prudent, is the word of wisdom: and like a river of life, righteousness.

(Sirach 31:31) 
A wise man knows the times and judgement: and in evils he does not labor a little.

(Sirach 32:1) 
The one who fears God will do good works, and the one who upholds justice will obtain it; he will receive it as a mother receives her children.

(Sirach 32:2) 
God will feed him with the bread of life and give him understanding and a rain of doctrine.

(Sirach 32:3) 
He will fulfill his confidence and give him eternal glory.

(Sirach 32:4) 
Evil thoughts, perversions of the heart, and wickedness destroy all.

(Sirach 32:5) 
The Holy Spirit departs from all, and wisdom goes away from things without understanding.

(Sirach 32:6) 
The wise man knows the words of wisdom and receives it, and the hearing of the desire is the judgment of the law.

(Sirach 32:7) 
Just as water puts out a fire, so almsgiving extinguishes sin.

(Sirach 32:8) 
He who gives thanks is mindful of the future, and in due time will find favor.

(Sirach 32:9) 
As water puts out a blazing fire, so almsgiving resists sins.

(Sirach 32:10) 
He who gives grace is mindful of the future, and in due time will find favor.

(Sirach 32:11) 
Many give but do not have, and those who receive what is not theirs do evil.

(Sirach 32:12) 
Many become poor from great glory and are honored because of the hands of others.

(Sirach 32:13) 
Many have toiled in needs and have poverty in their life.

(Sirach 32:14) 
These are those who trust in themselves and look to their own glory.

(Sirach 32:15) 
Greater is he who is honored in poverty, and he who dishonors glory in abundance is less.

(Sirach 32:16) 
He who is justified in poverty is good, and he who is rich and becomes sad is wicked.

(Sirach 32:17) 
He who loves his soul flagellates it, and he who loves his son constantly chastises him.

(Sirach 32:18) 
He who bends his rod burdens his son, and will rejoice in him in the end.

(Sirach 32:19) 
He who teaches his son will have profit from him, and will glory in him among his acquaintances.

(Sirach 32:20) 
He who teaches his son will be envied by his enemy and will glory in him among his friends.

(Sirach 32:21) 
He who dies for his son is as if he had not died, for he has left a protector after him.

(Sirach 32:22) 
He who leaves a son as an heir in his testament leaves him as if he had left him from his treasures and trusts in him.

(Sirach 32:23) 
He who begets a son saves himself from his enemies, and the enemy will glory in him.

(Sirach 32:24) 
He who loves his son frequently flagellates him, so that he may rejoice in him in the end.

(Sirach 32:25) 
He who restrains his son binds up wounds, and is troubled by every sound.

(Sirach 32:26) 
An untamed horse becomes harsh, and a son neglected becomes willful.

(Sirach 32:27) 
Correct a boy and you will trouble his loins.

(Sirach 32:28) 
A goad for a horse, a rod for a donkey, and whips for a son.

(Sirach 32:29) 
Teach your son, and you will work with him, and you will not be ashamed of his behavior.

(Sirach 32:30) 
Do not abandon your soul to your desires, and do not afflict yourself with your own thoughts.

(Sirach 32:31) 
If you give your soul its desire in the thing it wants, it will make you a cause of joy to your enemies.

(Sirach 32:32) 
Do not glory in riches if you lose yourself, and do not say, “I have enough, and I will suffer nothing bad.”

(Sirach 32:33) 
Do not follow your soul in its desires; turn away from your desires.

(Sirach 33:1) 
One who fears God will avoid all evils, and by keeping His commandments, he protects himself.

(Sirach 33:2) 
A wise heart will know the law, and justice will grow like the moon.

(Sirach 33:3) 
The heart of the wicked seeks evil, but like a shadowy attempt, it vanishes.

(Sirach 33:4) 
A man of piety will be strong in wisdom like the sun, and his righteousness will be as firm as the moon.

(Sirach 33:5) 
The wicked heart scrutinizes iniquity, seeking evil, and will not cease until wrath descends.

(Sirach 33:6) 
The wicked are hated by the perfect man, and the just man curses the wicked.

(Sirach 33:7) 
A proven son is a hidden treasure, and one who loves him will honor him.

(Sirach 33:8) 
One who fears God lacks nothing: and as his works are, so shall his reward be.

(Sirach 33:9) 
He who hopes in the Lord will not fail: nor will he delay, and will not pass away.

(Sirach 33:10) 
He who fears God fears nothing: and he will not be afraid, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 33:11) 
The soul that fears God, whom will it fear? And in whom is his hope?

(Sirach 33:12) 
The eye of the Lord is upon those who fear Him: a protector of strength, the foundation of hope, and a shadow from the sun on the right, a protection from ruin, and a defense against falling.

(Sirach 33:13) 
Enlightening the eyes, and giving grace, health, and life.

(Sirach 33:14) 
He who sacrifices unjustly offers a stained sacrifice: and the sacrifices of the unjust are not pleasing.

(Sirach 33:15) 
The Most High does not delight in the offerings of the wicked, nor will He be appeased for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.

(Sirach 33:16) 
He who offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who kills his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 33:17) 
The bread of the poor is the life of the needy: he who defrauds him is a man of blood.

(Sirach 33:18) 
He who takes away bread from labor is like one who kills his neighbor.

(Sirach 33:19) 
Those who shed blood, and those who defraud a hired worker, are brothers.

(Sirach 33:20) 
When you build, and when you destroy, what will you gain? Why pray if it is a burden to you?

(Sirach 33:21) 
When you fast, and again fast, and when you fast a third time, what do you gain? Because fasting is not pleasing to the Lord.

(Sirach 33:22) 
He who fasts for sins: and who puts away sins, let him beware lest he do them again: and he who prays for sins is foolish.

(Sirach 33:23) 
He who offers sacrifice from the substance of the poor, is like one who kills his son in the sight of his father.

(Sirach 33:24) 
The bread of the poor is life, he who defrauds him is a man of blood.

(Sirach 33:25) 
He who takes away bread from labor takes away the blood of his neighbor.

(Sirach 33:26) 
When you build, the wicked then build, and you who build, the wicked destroy: and when you pray, what will you pray for?

(Sirach 33:27) 
When you fast, you are not delighted: and when you offer, you will not be received.

(Sirach 33:28) 
What is the value of life, and what of works, and what of labor?

(Sirach 33:29) 
Do not contend with your children, nor use words against the wicked.

(Sirach 33:30) 
Turn away from the wicked man, and from the understanding of the impious.

(Sirach 33:31) 
Be to me in judgment, and defend me: and deliver me.

(Sirach 33:32) 
Give me confidence in your understanding: and do not confound me in fear.

(Sirach 33:33) 
Teach the fear of the Lord to your children, and God will humble your enemies.

(Sirach 33:34) 
The more you are exalted, the more humble yourself in all things, and you will find grace before God.

(Sirach 33:35) 
For there are many powerful, and unknown, and noble, and poor, all seeking the grace of God.

(Sirach 33:36) 
Those who feared the Lord, and feared, and did not despise his commandments.

(Sirach 33:37) 
Those who feared the Lord, hoped in him: and they were not abandoned.

(Sirach 33:38) 
Those who feared the Lord did not despise his words: and they were not disobedient to him.

(Sirach 33:39) 
Those who feared the Lord, and sought his pleasure, and loved him.

(Sirach 33:40) 
Those who feared the Lord, prepare their hearts, and humbled their souls in his sight.

(Sirach 33:41) 
Let us fall into the hands of men, and not into the hands of God: for according to his greatness and his mercy, so also is his rebuke.

(Sirach 34:1) 
The one who fears God will do good things, and the one who holds onto justice will grasp it fully.

(Sirach 34:2) 
And justice will meet him like an honorable mother, and she will meet him as a new wife does her husband.

(Sirach 34:3) 
Bread gives food to the living, and wisdom gives understanding to the heart.

(Sirach 34:4) 
In wisdom, his heart will be made strong, as if in the days of rain, and like a great river, his knowledge will overflow.

(Sirach 34:5) 
Just as a flood sends forth rivers, so too does the anger of the angry. As fire burns wood, so too does the anger of the arrogant.

(Sirach 34:6) 
God is merciful and good, and He will have mercy. In the days of affliction, He will show favor like the rain clouds.

(Sirach 34:7) 
The one who trusts in Him will not be afraid or fear, because He is his hope.

(Sirach 34:8) 
The soul of the one who fears God will not fear. Indeed, his hope is not in strangers.

(Sirach 34:9) 
Who has feared the Lord, and He has abandoned him? Or who has called upon Him, and He has despised him?

(Sirach 34:10) 
For God is compassionate and merciful, and He will forgive sins in the day of tribulation and protect all who confess themselves.

(Sirach 34:11) 
Woe to the cowardly heart, because it does not believe; therefore, it will not be protected.

(Sirach 34:12) 
Woe to the one who loses patience, and what will he do with what he has done?

(Sirach 34:13) 
The one who fears God will not be saddened, and the one who loves Him will keep His law.

(Sirach 34:14) 
The one who fears God will prepare his heart and sanctify his soul in His sight.

(Sirach 34:15) 
The one who fears God will seek to please Him, and those who love Him will fulfill His law.

(Sirach 34:16) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts and humble their souls in the sight of the Most High.

(Sirach 34:17) 
Sinners will fall into the hands of God and will perish according to His wrath.

(Sirach 34:18) 
The impious man will not remain in repentance, and the sinner will not remain long.

(Sirach 34:19) 
The sinner and the impious speak harsh words and write their wicked deeds.

(Sirach 34:20) 
As is the generation, so too are their works.

(Sirach 34:21) 
The works of the proud are detestable to God, and He is angry with them.

(Sirach 34:22) 
Terrible vengeance is upon the impious nations.

(Sirach 34:23) 
The judgment of the day of death is for the sons of men.

(Sirach 34:24) 
Remember your last things, and you will cease to sin forever.

(Sirach 34:25) 
What is more beautiful than the sun and the moon? For even the shining star changes in its time.

(Sirach 34:26) 
And what is more beautiful than a vessel shining in goodness? For even gold and the emerald stone; and what is more beautiful than the beauty of a beautiful woman?

(Sirach 34:27) 
Nothing surpasses the beauty of a woman, and what is more delightful than a good man?

(Sirach 34:28) 
As the sun when it rises in the world, so is the beauty of a woman in the adornment of her home.

(Sirach 34:29) 
A lamp shining on a holy lampstand is how a face is in a beautiful stature.

(Sirach 34:30) 
As golden pillars upon a silver base, so are the feet upon stable soles.

(Sirach 34:31) 
What is the value against the eyes of a man who is alone, like beauty in appearance?

(Sirach 34:32) 
It is better for both, the one who keeps both; because both the one who is praised by him, and the one who loves him, is a friend.

(Sirach 34:33) 
The one who fears God will have both, and as is his fruit, so too is his glory.

(Sirach 34:34) 
It is not good to be wicked, and the proud is not honorable. For the one who does not fear the Lord will perish.

(Sirach 35:1) 
The one who honors God does good deeds, and the one who holds to the truth will grasp it like a fire, and he will hold to it.

(Sirach 35:2) 
The one who fears God will desire good, and he will receive the blessing as a mother's honor.

(Sirach 35:3) 
He will nourish himself on the bread of life and understanding, and he will drink the water of wisdom.

(Sirach 35:4) 
God will make him strong, and he will not be shaken. He will hold fast to God, and he will not be put to shame.

(Sirach 35:5) 
God will lift him up in the midst of the Church, and He will open his mouth with the fullness of the spirit of wisdom, and He will fill him with the spirit of understanding.

(Sirach 35:6) 
And God will clothe him in a garment of glory and a crown of joy.

(Sirach 35:7) 
Let your friends and your neighbors not separate from you. Be constantly with the powerful and the one who knows God.

(Sirach 35:8) 
Hold fast to the teaching of piety, and choose a just man and a God-fearing man.

(Sirach 35:9) 
May the spirit of the just be with you, and you will be glorified in the fear of God.

(Sirach 35:10) 
To hope in God is a great thing, and not to abandon His commandments is life.

(Sirach 35:11) 
The one who fears the Lord will fear nothing, and he will not be afraid because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:12) 
The Lord will not reject the soul of the one who fears God, and He will not abandon him in temptation.

(Sirach 35:13) 
The one who fears God will hope in Him, and his eyes are fixed on the Lord.

(Sirach 35:14) 
The one who fears God will not fear men, and he will not be troubled because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:15) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 35:16) 
To whom, in what manner, and by whom, and about what will he hope?

(Sirach 35:17) 
The eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear Him. He is a powerful protector, the foundation of strength, and a shelter from the burning sun, and a shade from the midday heat.

(Sirach 35:18) 
From the one who strikes with anger, and from the one who offends, He protects the soul, and delivers it from the troubles of the world.

(Sirach 35:19) 
The one who offers a sacrifice unjustly is stained. The offerings of the wicked will not be accepted.

(Sirach 35:20) 
The Lord is good to those who love Him.

(Sirach 35:21) 
They do what is just and labor in the judgment of truth.

(Sirach 35:22) 
Do not turn to wickedness, and do not follow the path of sinners.

(Sirach 35:23) 
All wickedness is an abomination to God, and He will punish sinners for it.

(Sirach 35:24) 
You will not be separated from the wicked without cause, and you will depart from sins.

(Sirach 35:25) 
Do not be joined to a disobedient son, and depart from the sons of sinners.

(Sirach 35:26) 
Recognize the time, and beware of evil.

(Sirach 35:27) 
A good soul will endure all things, and it will be crowned for its patience.

(Sirach 35:28) 
If you find yourself in affliction, remain. In your patience, have patience.

(Sirach 35:29) 
Accept whatever happens to you, endure pain, and be patient in your humility.

(Sirach 35:30) 
For gold and silver are tested in fire, and men are tested in the furnace of humility.

(Sirach 35:31) 
Trust in Him, and He will help you. Direct your ways, and hope in Him.

(Sirach 35:32) 
The one who fears God will fear nothing, and will not be troubled because He is his hope.

(Sirach 35:33) 
Blessed is the soul that fears God.

(Sirach 35:34) 
For God looks upon those who love Him.

(Sirach 35:35) 
Those who fear God, and who endure in His works, will find grace from Him.

(Sirach 35:36) 
The one who seeks the Law will be filled with it, and the one who meditates on its work will be glorified.

(Sirach 35:37) 
Those who fear the Lord prepare their hearts, and in His sight, they humble their souls.

(Sirach 35:38) 
They will fall into the hands of God, and their sins will not be removed.

(Sirach 36:1) 
God of all, show mercy to us and look upon us. Let Your face shine upon us, and have mercy.

(Sirach 36:2) 
So we may know Your ways and understand Your paths.

(Sirach 36:3) 
Show us Your mercy, Lord, and grant us Your salvation.

(Sirach 36:4) 
I will speak in my tribulation: The Lord has been my hope.

(Sirach 36:5) 
My soul is troubled, and because of this, I remember You from the land of the Jordan, and from Hermon and the little mountain.

(Sirach 36:6) 
Deep calls to deep at the voice of Your cataracts; all Your high things and Your waves have passed over me.

(Sirach 36:7) 
In the daytime the Lord commanded His mercy, and at night His song.

(Sirach 36:8) 
My prayer is to God, the life of my soul.

(Sirach 36:9) 
I will say to God: You are my protector and my refuge, my God, for You are merciful to me.

(Sirach 36:10) 
For the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth comes prudence and understanding.

(Sirach 36:11) 
Whoever comes from the earth and is upon the earth returns to dust, and so it is with those who pursue and those who offer.

(Sirach 36:12) 
All men are like the earth, and Adam was fashioned from the earth.

(Sirach 36:13) 
In the knowledge of God, He separated them and scattered their ways.

(Sirach 36:14) 
Whoever does iniquity is an abomination, and whoever acts proudly is unjust.

(Sirach 36:15) 
What is pride? It is death.

(Sirach 36:16) 
All things that move upon the earth will turn to dust; and He who created them is also from the earth.

(Sirach 36:17) 
The body of man lasts but a time: what is more than all that is born of the earth?

(Sirach 36:18) 
Nothing is above the sun, and nothing is more empty than the tongue of the wicked.

(Sirach 36:19) 
Blessed are those in wisdom, and those in understanding, and those who meditate on God in their thoughts.

(Sirach 36:20) 
The wise will be in their heart, and they will proclaim the teachings of justice.

(Sirach 36:21) 
Whoever is wise will also teach wisely, and whoever listens will judge.

(Sirach 36:22) 
The more you are wise, the greater you will be, and the more you grow, the more great things will be in you.

(Sirach 36:23) 
He who sees much will understand more than a man.

(Sirach 36:24) 
Who has investigated His works? And who will declare His marvels?

(Sirach 36:25) 
For what is man? What is his understanding? And what will he do?

(Sirach 36:26) 
The number of a man's days, at best, is one hundred years. What is that in the sight of eternity?

(Sirach 36:27) 
Like a drop of the sea, and like a drop of rain: and who can number the sea, and the drops, and the days of the age?

(Sirach 36:28) 
There are three things my soul feared, and I feared a fourth: when a rumor about a city arises, and the gathering of a multitude,

(Sirach 36:29) 
and the slander of the people: it is more horrible than death.

(Sirach 36:30) 
Misery and sorrow is when a woman is jealous of her husband, and when jealousy becomes angry.

(Sirach 36:31) 
The tongue is a sharp sword, and anger and disturbance are unjust.

(Sirach 36:32) 
He who loves God will have life, and he who loves Him will receive discipline.

(Sirach 36:33) 
He who fears God will be in good, and he who hopes in Him will not fail.

(Sirach 36:34) 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of His love; and faith is chosen with justice.

(Sirach 36:35) 
His Spirit is life, and refreshment: He will visit those who love Him, and He will appear to them in His joy.

(Sirach 36:36) 
He who fears God will prepare his heart, and in His sight he will humble his soul.

(Sirach 36:37) 
He who fears God will hope in Him, and as in His sight, so also he will find mercy.

(Sirach 36:38) 
He who seeks the law will be filled with it: and he who is on its way will be loved.

(Sirach 36:39) 
He who fears God will understand judgment, and he will be enlightened like light.

(Sirach 36:40) 
The sinner despises the law: and he will find in it according to his own will.

(Sirach 36:41) 
The wicked man does not direct his heart, and therefore he will not prosper.

(Sirach 36:42) 
When a wicked man is saddened, he curses: and he will find bitterness of heart.

(Sirach 36:43) 
The proud man will not be filled with doctrine: and as in a vessel of ignorance, so it will not be in him.

(Sirach 36:44) 
The wise man will hear the words of wisdom, and will test them; and a parable in doctrine, and he will understand the sense.

(Sirach 37:1) 
Every truly wise man will seek reverence for God, and he will learn wisdom and justice, and embrace discipline.

(Sirach 37:2) 
Whoever fears God will do good, and whoever is careful to be just, will have his prayers heard.

(Sirach 37:3) 
Whoever fears God honors his parents, and is like a servant to them who gave him life.

(Sirach 37:4) 
In deed and word, honor your father and your mother, and in all patience.

(Sirach 37:5) 
So that God's blessing may come to you, and remain with you until the end of your life.

(Sirach 37:6) 
Son, assist your father in his old age, and do not grieve him during his life.

(Sirach 37:7) 
Even if his mind has failed, have mercy on him, and do not despise him when you are strong.

(Sirach 37:8) 
For the alms of your father will not be forgotten, and for the sins of your mother, you will have a store of merit.

(Sirach 37:9) 
In the day of your tribulation, you will remember them, and as ice melts in the heat, so will your sins be forgiven.

(Sirach 37:10) 
A son is cursed who forsakes his father, and who embitters her who gave him birth.

(Sirach 37:11) 
Perform your works with gentleness, and you will be honored by men.

(Sirach 37:12) 
The greater you are, humble yourself in all things, and you will find favor before God.

(Sirach 37:13) 
For God is great in power, and He favors those who are humble.

(Sirach 37:14) 
Those who seek to understand His majesty are overwhelmed by His glory.

(Sirach 37:15) 
For in the searching of those who seek, glory is hidden, and in power, He conceals glory.

(Sirach 37:16) 
Observe the proper time for your tasks, and beware of evil.

(Sirach 37:17) 
Do not do what is displeasing to Him, and do not believe evil.

(Sirach 37:18) 
Before all your works, know your end, and then act accordingly.

(Sirach 37:19) 
Before judgment, do what is just, and before you investigate, justify yourself.

(Sirach 37:20) 
Before illness, take care of yourself, and before judgment, examine yourself, and you will find favor in the sight of God.

(Sirach 37:21) 
Before death, work, and at the appointed time, you will die like a passing man.

(Sirach 37:22) 
As leaves on a blooming tree, and fruits, so are the generations of human flesh.

(Sirach 37:23) 
One generation of man is born, and another follows, and as a leaf falls from a tree, so too does the generation of flesh and blood.

(Sirach 37:24) 
One follows another, and he himself remains in his own generation, and after that, what will he gain from his works?

(Sirach 37:25) 
All things return to the earth, and like water, so are the just.

(Sirach 37:26) 
The many works of the wicked will be scattered, but justice will remain forever.

(Sirach 37:27) 
The riches of the wicked dry up like a torrent, and will resound like a great thunder in the rain.

(Sirach 37:28) 
They open their hands, and rejoice: but transgressors will be consumed.

(Sirach 37:29) 
The root of the wicked will not produce branches, and the unclean branches will not bear fruit.

(Sirach 37:30) 
The children of the wicked will not multiply, and an impious people will not have a root.

(Sirach 37:31) 
The children of the just are like branches, a holy planting.

(Sirach 37:32) 
And the seed of the elect is like a strengthened root.

(Sirach 37:33) 
The just man is known by his fruit, and his memory will not be taken away forever.

(Sirach 37:34) 
In judgment, he will not fear, and he will stand confidently at the end.

(Sirach 37:35) 
A heart that fears God, and in His commandments, will find wisdom.

(Sirach 37:36) 
He who does not fear God will not be justified, because His wrath falls upon him.

(Sirach 37:37) 
The patience of a man is seen in his dealings with his neighbor, and his works are marked with sense.

(Sirach 37:38) 
God hates the proud man, and all wickedness is detestable to Him.

(Sirach 37:39) 
God has removed nations from the unjust, and has planted the humble in their place.

(Sirach 37:40) 
God gave the land to the nations, and He took Israel as an inheritance.

(Sirach 37:41) 
All the works of men are before Him, and those who will stand before Him will not be hidden from His eyes.

(Sirach 37:42) 
From age to age, He looks, and nothing is a marvel before Him.

(Sirach 37:43) 
It is not right to say, 'What is this?' or 'Why is this?', because in all His will, God will act.

(Sirach 37:44) 
The blessing of a man is like a flower, and the just man's fruit will remain.

(Sirach 37:45) 
Do not say, 'What is this?' or 'What is that?' because all things will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 37:46) 
God will immediately justify in His word, and in a moment He will hasten judgment.

(Sirach 37:47) 
The wicked man who rejects God and has an iniquitous heart will multiply evils for himself.

(Sirach 38:1) 
Honor the doctor, for his service is a necessity, because God Himself created the doctor to heal.

(Sirach 38:2) 
And all healing comes from the Most High: it is a gift from God, and the doctor will receive it.

(Sirach 38:3) 
The doctor's knowledge will lift up his head, and he will be admired by the great.

(Sirach 38:4) 
God made medicines from the earth, and a prudent man will not reject them.

(Sirach 38:5) 
Wasn't bitter water sweetened by a tree? The power of the doctor is seen in his works.

(Sirach 38:6) 
God gave knowledge to men, so that they might be glorified in His wonders.

(Sirach 38:7) 
With them he cures and alleviates pain: and with them he makes a medicine, so that his work may be perfected.

(Sirach 38:8) 
Son, when you are sick, do not be negligent: but pray to God, and He will heal you.

(Sirach 38:9) 
Turn away from sin and direct your hands, and cleanse your heart from every fault.

(Sirach 38:10) 
Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour, and make a fat sacrifice.

(Sirach 38:11) 
And give the doctor his place, because he too is necessary: because God Himself created him.

(Sirach 38:12) 
For there is a time when there are prosperities in their hands.

(Sirach 38:13) 
And they will pray to God, that He may direct them on the way, and to the progress of healing and to life.

(Sirach 38:14) 
He who sins against Him Who made him, let him fall into the hands of the doctor.

(Sirach 38:15) 
Son, pour out tears over the dead, and begin to mourn as if you were suffering evil.

(Sirach 38:16) 
And bury his body according to custom: and do not be idle over his burial.

(Sirach 38:17) 
Mourn with love, and lament for her, because she is worthy: and make mourning for her according to her merits, for one or two days, because of the curse, and then be consoled after your sorrow.

(Sirach 38:18) 
For sorrow causes death, and the life of a sinful man.

(Sirach 38:19) 
After the death of a man, his inheritance rests: and before his death, his life.

(Sirach 38:20) 
When he lives, and breathes, he is changed: and he labors, and is troubled.

(Sirach 38:21) 
A wise man in doctrine, and abounding in wisdom, he will work righteousness.

(Sirach 38:22) 
He who looks to the law of the Most High, will acquire it: and he who is occupied with it, will be glorified.

(Sirach 38:23) 
Those who work in it, will say: Because there is no labor in it: and the children of wisdom are justified.

(Sirach 38:24) 
He who prepares his words, will be heard: and he who perseveres in his prayers, will obtain.

(Sirach 38:25) 
His heart will search at dawn: and he will persevere in his doctrine.

(Sirach 38:26) 
A wise heart will seek good things: and for all who are occupied with it, it will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 38:27) 
Like the work of a potter, and his work: all his works are in his will.

(Sirach 38:28) 
All his works are in his will: and He commanded, and they will be done in His will.

(Sirach 38:29) 
The Lord loves holy works: and He has love for all his chosen ones.

(Sirach 38:30) 
Water and fire, and sword and wars, and famine and pestilence: all these were created for the use of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:31) 
They were changed for evil: and for the punishment of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:32) 
All things that are created are in two: good and evil.

(Sirach 38:33) 
Such are all the works of the wicked: and contrary to the works of the saints.

(Sirach 38:34) 
It is not wonderful that glory is given in a moment and in time: since when it is present, it is not wonderful.

(Sirach 38:35) 
It is better, therefore, that he should work in evil in good days.

(Sirach 38:36) 
The works of the just are like the sun: and the works of the wicked, night and darkness.

(Sirach 38:37) 
It is better for you, to preserve your soul, than to walk in the sight of the wicked.

(Sirach 38:38) 
A wise man in speech is detestable: and a fool will not remain in it.

(Sirach 38:39) 
The wise man in speech, and in doctrine will become hateful.

(Sirach 38:40) 
He gave sense to the wise, and he found the treasure of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:41) 
For he who works in the will, does not perfect himself in the work: and he who is angry, corrupts his soul.

(Sirach 38:42) 
The heart of the patient, is until the time: and then joy will be returned to him.

(Sirach 38:43) 
His speech is brief, until the time: and afterwards his lips will drip words of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:44) 
In the treasures of wisdom are the words of wisdom.

(Sirach 38:45) 
The treasure of impiety is hateful, for he who is occupied with them is detestable.

(Sirach 38:46) 
Son, if you have, work with fear, and do all things in faith.

(Sirach 38:47) 
In all your work, look to your end, and you will not sin for eternity.

(Sirach 39:1) 
The wisdom of the just will explain its judgment, and the assembly will hear his praise.

(Sirach 39:2) 
You will not be praised by the mouth of the wicked, for he is the father of iniquity.

(Sirach 39:3) 
Praise will be in the mind of the just, and the nations will speak of his wisdom.

(Sirach 39:4) 
The mouth of the wicked is like dead wood: they will see, and they will rejoice.

(Sirach 39:5) 
You will not give riches to the wicked, and the just will not see iniquity.

(Sirach 39:6) 
The wicked will hate the just, and the just will hate him.

(Sirach 39:7) 
The wicked and the iniquitous are alike.

(Sirach 39:8) 
The tribulations of the just are from the hand of the wicked: scourges and death.

(Sirach 39:9) 
Wise men understand wisdom and put it forth in the sight of lords: and judgement, and the teaching of justice and judgement.

(Sirach 39:10) 
They hope in God, and they will be saved: and they keep his commandments, and they will find him.

(Sirach 39:11) 
Those who fear the Lord will find judgement and will illuminate their justice like fire.

(Sirach 39:12) 
The sinner will not regard wisdom, but his iniquity will be called upon him.

(Sirach 39:13) 
The son of a fool will destroy his father, and he who has no understanding will shame his mother.

(Sirach 39:14) 
Woe to you, fools, because you have not observed the law of God: when you fall, you will not be.

(Sirach 39:15) 
It is better for a man without wisdom, and not having wisdom, than having it and sinning.

(Sirach 39:16) 
It is better for a man who does not have wisdom to fear, than to have it and be saddened.

(Sirach 39:17) 
It is better for a man without wisdom and sinning, than to multiply wisdom and sins.

(Sirach 39:18) 
Let him fear himself, and sustain himself in the sight of God, and in his judgement wisdom will liberate him.

(Sirach 39:19) 
The wisdom of men is to know their way: and to recognize the power of him who made it.

(Sirach 39:20) 
He who knows his ways will know his laws, and will show glory in his judgement.

(Sirach 39:21) 
He who does not know wisdom, nor its power, will perish in judgement.

(Sirach 39:22) 
My son, do not have many things in your works: and if you do many things, you will not be free from blame: and if you follow after, you will not attain.

(Sirach 39:23) 
Do not hasten after riches, nor the powerful in judgement.

(Sirach 39:24) 
Do not despise the poor in judgement: because he is humble and you will be thankful to him, and do not grieve the poor in your sight.

(Sirach 39:25) 
Do not do injury against a hungry soul: and do not provoke a man in need.

(Sirach 39:26) 
Do not add to a saddened mind: and do not delay because of the needy.

(Sirach 39:27) 
Do not die for the soul of the poor, and do not turn your eyes away from the needy.

(Sirach 39:28) 
Turn away from a reviling tongue: and do not associate with him who slanders, because the ruin of his work is in his mouth.

(Sirach 39:29) 
Do not seek sin, and do not scrutinize those things which do not pertain to you.

(Sirach 39:30) 
Son, do not have many business dealings: for if you multiply them, you will not be free from blame: and if you follow after them, you will not attain, and you will not escape, and you will not succeed.

(Sirach 39:31) 
Many have labored to become rich, and their life is for nothing: and who are they?

(Sirach 39:32) 
But others have labored and did not hasten, and others progressed, and did not find.

(Sirach 39:33) 
But others have labored and did not have: and in this too they labored.

(Sirach 39:34) 
Others worked and were careful, and did not take care: and in this too they labored.

(Sirach 39:35) 
I saw a certain man who labored in those things which he had prepared, and did not have food to eat.

(Sirach 39:36) 
All these things are in the fear of God: and in his will.

(Sirach 39:37) 
Like the works of the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the clouds, and the wind, and the waters, and the spirits, and the thunders, and the lightnings.

(Sirach 39:38) 
Who do these in their time, and they will return on their day.

(Sirach 39:39) 
Those who act from God, and his commandments, will be blessed in their works.

(Sirach 40:1) 
God made great wisdom, and is perfect in all His works.

(Sirach 40:2) 
Who can count the grains of sand in the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of the world?

(Sirach 40:3) 
Who can measure the height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, or the depth of the abyss?

(Sirach 40:4) 
Wisdom was created before everything: understanding of prudence comes from eternity.

(Sirach 40:5) 
The source of wisdom is the Word of God in the highest heavens, and its path is eternal law.

(Sirach 40:6) 
To whom was the root of wisdom revealed, and who has known its shrewdness?

(Sirach 40:7) 
There is only one Almighty Creator, a powerful King, greatly feared, who sits on his throne and rules.

(Sirach 40:8) 
He created wisdom in the Holy Spirit, saw it, counted it, and measured it.

(Sirach 40:9) 
He poured wisdom out over all His works, over all flesh according to His gift, and gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 40:10) 
Fear of the Lord is glory, boasting, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 40:11) 
Fear of the Lord will delight the heart, give joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 40:12) 
It will go well for those who fear God in the end, and they will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 40:13) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of it: and they love Him through sanctification.

(Sirach 40:14) 
The love of wisdom is honor: and those to whom she appears love her.

(Sirach 40:15) 
Fear of God is the fulfillment of God's commandments: and whoever holds it, lives as if in paradise.

(Sirach 40:16) 
Every sensible person, and whoever understands wisdom, will hate evil.

(Sirach 40:17) 
The source of wisdom is the Word of God in the highest heavens: and its path is eternal law.

(Sirach 40:18) 
To whom are the roots of wisdom revealed, and who has known its shrewdness?

(Sirach 40:19) 
There is one most high, almighty creator, a powerful king greatly to be feared, sitting upon His throne, and ruling as God.

(Sirach 40:20) 
He created it in the Holy Spirit, and saw it, and counted it, and measured it.

(Sirach 40:21) 
And He poured it out over all His works, and over all flesh according to His gift: and He gave it to those who love Him.

(Sirach 40:22) 
Fear of God is glory, boasting, joy, and the crown of exultation.

(Sirach 40:23) 
Fear of God delights the heart, and gives joy, gladness, and length of days.

(Sirach 40:24) 
It will be well for those who fear God in the end, and they will be blessed on the day of their death.

(Sirach 40:25) 
The beginning of the fear of God is the choice of it: and they love Him through sanctification.

(Sirach 40:26) 
The love of wisdom is honor: and those to whom she appears love her.

(Sirach 40:27) 
The fear of God is the fulfillment of God's commandments: and whoever holds it, dwells as if in paradise.

(Sirach 40:28) 
Every sensible person and whoever understands wisdom, will hate evil.

(Sirach 40:29) 
Son, if you receive your soul, keep it from lust, and give it what it desires.

(Sirach 40:30) 
Do not give your soul to lust, and turn away from your own will.

(Sirach 40:31) 
If you give your soul to appetite, it will make your enemies happy.

(Sirach 40:32) 
Do not delight in pleasures, and do not let their expenses turn you aside.

(Sirach 40:33) 
Do not become a beggar in poverty: it is better to die than to be in need.

(Sirach 40:34) 
The life of a man who is in his work, who is in his agriculture, who is in his vineyards, and who is in the work of artifice, and in his riches.

(Sirach 40:35) 
It is better to work than to go begging: and to hope under the table of others.

(Sirach 40:36) 
In the life of those who are in their work, and who are in their agriculture, and who are in their vineyards, and who are in the work of artifice, and in their riches.

(Sirach 40:37) 
In their work all find wisdom.

(Sirach 40:38) 
The poor in his work, and those who work in labor, is better than the rich who err.

(Sirach 40:39) 
Son, keep your soul in peace, and fear God.

(Sirach 40:40) 
From His splendor comes the Holy Spirit, and His fear, and there is nothing in His precepts.

(Sirach 40:41) 
Every soul loves wisdom with fear: and whoever keeps it will be amazed.

(Sirach 40:42) 
Whoever holds wisdom will possess life.

(Sirach 40:43) 
But whoever fears God will obtain both: and whoever holds it will be enlightened.

(Sirach 40:44) 
Whoever holds her will be enlightened: and she will meet him like a mother.

(Sirach 40:45) 
She will feed him with the bread of life, and give him the water of understanding to drink.

(Sirach 40:46) 
He will trust in her, and will not be ashamed: and he will exalt her, and will rule among men: and will open his mouth in prayer, and will be heard even by God.

(Sirach 40:47) 
And afterwards he will direct his mind to her: and he will converse in her knowledge.

(Sirach 40:48) 
If you love your soul, son, keep chastity, and give her what pleases.

(Sirach 40:49) 
If you lust in your soul, depart from your will, and from your own will.

(Sirach 40:50) 
This is the good of man, a good conscience, and honor is in all justice.

(Sirach 41:1) 
Remembering death and life—this is the beginning of wisdom.

(Sirach 41:2) 
In life, be mindful of good things and avoid evil.

(Sirach 41:3) 
The sins of the wicked are their enemies, and they love those who commit evil.

(Sirach 41:4) 
Every living creature loves its own kind, and every person loves their neighbor.

(Sirach 41:5) 
All living things associate with their own, and people associate with their equals.

(Sirach 41:6) 
What fellowship can exist between a wolf and a lamb? So too, between a sinner and a righteous person.

(Sirach 41:7) 
What peace is there between a hyena and a dog? That is how it is with sinners.

(Sirach 41:8) 
Who can associate with the unclean? What common ground is there between truth and lies?

(Sirach 41:9) 
There is no agreement between a righteous person and a sinner, and no harmony among the wicked.

(Sirach 41:10) 
A lion stalks donkeys in search of prey; that's how sinners hunt those who do evil.

(Sirach 41:11) 
Scorn is for the wicked, and reproach for sinners.

(Sirach 41:12) 
Do not let your heart be filled with sorrow.

(Sirach 41:13) 
Do not stray onto their paths.

(Sirach 41:14) 
Don't linger on the paths of sinners, lest you fall into their traps.

(Sirach 41:15) 
Turn away from them, or you will be lost. You will be safe from evil.

(Sirach 41:16) 
Do not go near them, lest you come to love their sins.

(Sirach 41:17) 
And you will be taken by their destruction.

(Sirach 41:18) 
Do not let your soul fall into their power.

(Sirach 41:19) 
Be careful not to go down their paths.

(Sirach 41:20) 
Do not stray from the paths of the wicked, lest your feet slip.

(Sirach 41:21) 
Do all your work in faith; this is the way of the commandments.

(Sirach 41:22) 
Faith is the preservation of salvation.

(Sirach 41:23) 
Works of justice light the way.

(Sirach 41:24) 
Those who do good will prepare rewards for themselves.

(Sirach 41:25) 
Those who do what is right will be filled with them.

(Sirach 41:26) 
Like water for the thirsty, so is the sinner.

(Sirach 41:27) 
They look at bitter things, but hope for what they cannot obtain.

(Sirach 41:28) 
Those who forsake the law despise His hand, and those who walk in the ways of the wicked offend Him.

(Sirach 41:29) 
Those who turn their hearts to vanity multiply their sins.

(Sirach 41:30) 
Good is returned to the good, and evil to the evil.

(Sirach 41:31) 
The iniquity of sinners is not wiped away, but a pious man will receive grace.

(Sirach 41:32) 
The good of a person is given, and the iniquity of the impious is reserved.

(Sirach 41:33) 
Do not say: “I have turned away from God. What is hidden from Him? Who remembers me?”

(Sirach 41:34) 
Think that you are seen by Him, and all your works bear witness.

(Sirach 41:35) 
Do not say: “God does not see, and He has turned away His face, and does not look at my ways.”

(Sirach 41:36) 
Because all your works are before Him, and all things are arranged in His sight.

(Sirach 41:37) 
Your works will always be before Him. You will be glorified for what you have done.

(Sirach 42:1) 
The wise contemplate all of His works, and the entire world is filled with His glory.

(Sirach 42:2) 
He established the universe; through His will, He created everything. Indeed, the Almighty spoke, and all things were made.

(Sirach 42:3) 
Who can ever explain the beauty of all His glorious works, or the full measure of His glory?

(Sirach 42:4) 
The sky's vastness, its height, the foundations of its splendor are the wonders He created.

(Sirach 42:5) 
The sun, when it appears in the universe, proclaims how wondrous is God's creation.

(Sirach 42:6) 
Midday's heat, and the sun's warmth in the changing seasons, is yet another example of His work.

(Sirach 42:7) 
He created frost and cold, and snow. They have their own courses, and their appointed seasons.

(Sirach 42:8) 
The wind, the clouds, and the spirit are all at His command.

(Sirach 42:9) 
All of these things give glory to God, who is the Spirit and Creator of all things.

(Sirach 42:10) 
God directs thunder at the appointed time, and creates tempests through His power.

(Sirach 42:11) 
He created the rivers, too, and directs them to serve His judgment, so that they may never fail.

(Sirach 42:12) 
Day and night display God's works, just as the sun always shines.

(Sirach 42:13) 
All living creatures think and feel in their own time, both day and night.

(Sirach 42:14) 
The sea with its depths, and its creatures, shows us His wonders.

(Sirach 42:15) 
The Holy Spirit, fire, and wind are all at God’s disposal on the day of judgment for vengeance.

(Sirach 42:16) 
God created water and clouds to give food to men.

(Sirach 42:17) 
He created seeds, and gave life on earth to men and women for their salvation.

(Sirach 42:18) 
He sends His people among the nations. Through these people, God’s judgment is at work.

(Sirach 42:19) 
And what does the work of man accomplish? His works are within him.

(Sirach 42:20) 
He created man from the earth, and gave him strength.

(Sirach 42:21) 
He said: “I created all things, and the whole earth is full of my power.”

(Sirach 42:22) 
He is wise, strong, just, and fears God. And in the days of the just, he will be honored.

(Sirach 42:23) 
The man who fears God will be honored, and the knowledge of the Law will be in him.

(Sirach 42:24) 
There is no fear of God in those who do not fear Him; instead, there is wrath, envy, and conflict.

(Sirach 42:25) 
Evil days are coming, and the wicked will be destroyed.

(Sirach 42:26) 
All things are created and will endure to their proper time.

(Sirach 42:27) 
For one is not like another, and one’s day of death is approaching.

(Sirach 42:28) 
There are two types of creation: good and evil.

(Sirach 42:29) 
The Lord will judge, and each man will receive what he has done.

(Sirach 42:30) 
The Lord will also judge the heart and mind.

(Sirach 42:31) 
Those with good hearts will receive the reward of their goodness, but those with evil hearts will receive their punishment.

(Sirach 42:32) 
Evil is the cause of all wicked deeds.

(Sirach 42:33) 
All creation is subject to sin, and all that is done is to be judged according to what is done.

(Sirach 42:34) 
The wicked will receive evil for evil.

(Sirach 42:35) 
The good will receive good for their good deeds.

(Sirach 42:36) 
The Lord sees with a discerning eye and will judge justly.

(Sirach 42:37) 
The Lord will always remember what each person does, and in their days he will judge.

(Sirach 42:38) 
There is no remembrance of what has been done, and no respite from the punishment.

(Sirach 42:39) 
My son, do good deeds, and seek the counsel of the wise.

(Sirach 42:40) 
Be cautious, and do not let your heart be swayed by any evil or wickedness.

(Sirach 42:41) 
Carry out your work well, and do not hesitate. Perform what you have been assigned to do.

(Sirach 42:42) 
Do not be ashamed of these words; have no shame in keeping His commandments.

(Sirach 42:43) 
Do not be ashamed of the Lord’s truth and His covenant, and speak the truth in the sight of all men.

(Sirach 42:44) 
Do not be ashamed to speak the truth, and do not conceal what you see.

(Sirach 42:45) 
Do not be ashamed to be questioned, and never be afraid to be just.

(Sirach 42:46) 
And do not be ashamed to keep the Sabbath and the Lord’s feasts.

(Sirach 42:47) 
And do not be ashamed to pay your vows, and to offer what you promised.

(Sirach 42:48) 
And do not be ashamed to pray to God and give alms, and to pay them.

(Sirach 42:49) 
Do not be ashamed to visit the sick, and to care for your deceased.

(Sirach 42:50) 
Do not be ashamed to be counted among the blessed and just.

(Sirach 42:51) 
Do not be ashamed to speak boldly, and do not hesitate to speak the truth.

(Sirach 42:52) 
But be ashamed of evil, wickedness, and injustice.

(Sirach 42:53) 
Do not be ashamed to correct the foolish, or to rebuke those who are unjust.

(Sirach 42:54) 
Follow your training, and do not be afraid to speak in the sight of all, and offer what is commanded.

(Sirach 42:55) 
The Lord is always with you, and His word gives you strength.

(Sirach 43:1) 
The sun is magnificent as it rises; its appearance is wonderful when it emerges.

(Sirach 43:2) 
At noon it scorches the land, and who can endure its heat?

(Sirach 43:3) 
The sun is like a furnace that provides heat. It is in the mountains, radiating outwards.

(Sirach 43:4) 
The sun is like a golden crown. Its position is perfect in its season.

(Sirach 43:5) 
The sun proclaims its own work and its rising, and it announces wonders.

(Sirach 43:6) 
How great is the work of the Lord! His wonders are hidden!

(Sirach 43:7) 
Who can know its strength?

(Sirach 43:8) 
And who can describe its works?

(Sirach 43:9) 
The moon is also magnificent at its time, in the months, to the season; it is a sign of the times.

(Sirach 43:10) 
The moon is from the table to the decrease and change in the months.

(Sirach 43:11) 
The moon is a sign of the feast, shining in the sky: the splendor of the sky.

(Sirach 43:12) 
The glory of the stars is its beauty in splendor on high from the Lord.

(Sirach 43:13) 
In the words of the Holy One, they shine in the expanse of the sky and are beautiful in their glory.

(Sirach 43:14) 
By the command of the Holy One, they stand in their place and do not tire in their vigils.

(Sirach 43:15) 
Look at the rainbow, and bless the one who made it; it is very beautiful in its radiance.

(Sirach 43:16) 
The rainbow surrounds the sky with its glory; the hands of the Most High have stretched it out.

(Sirach 43:17) 
He quickly sends out his command and hastens to go out, and does not delay in his day.

(Sirach 43:18) 
Who can describe the strength of the clouds, and who can describe the speed of thunder?

(Sirach 43:19) 
As the thunder comes out, it crushes the earth, and the mountains will thunder.

(Sirach 43:20) 
In its horror, the heart of my heart trembles, and I am disturbed by its cold.

(Sirach 43:21) 
When the spirit blows, ice solidifies, and like a flying bird, it passes.

(Sirach 43:22) 
In its appearance, the waters are amazed, and the ice is over the waters, almost like outside.

(Sirach 43:23) 
All the works of the Lord are good, and he will give each in its time.

(Sirach 43:24) 
We should not say, 'This is worse than that,' because all things will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 43:25) 
Now, with words, praise God and magnify him as much as you can.

(Sirach 43:26) 
Exalt him, and exalt him as much as you can, for he is greater, and you will not tire.

(Sirach 43:27) 
Who has seen him and can describe him? And who will magnify him as he was in the beginning?

(Sirach 43:28) 
Many hidden things are greater than these, for we have seen only a few of his works.

(Sirach 43:29) 
For God made all things and gave wisdom to the impious.

(Sirach 43:30) 
Wisdom knows knowledge and shows his signs and works of praise.

(Sirach 43:31) 
He who lives forever created all things in common and gave them individually to the impious.

(Sirach 43:32) 
He made known his works, and we have heard his glory.

(Sirach 43:33) 
The word on these things is much, and in short, let us say that he is all things.

(Sirach 43:34) 
All the works of God are good and will be done in their time.

(Sirach 43:35) 
We should not say, 'This is worse than that,' because all will be tested in their time.

(Sirach 43:36) 
So now, with your whole heart and voice, praise and bless God.

(Sirach 44:1) 
I will now offer praise to the famous men of old, and their memory will be blessed for all time.

(Sirach 44:2) 
The prophets of old have found their rest, and in their lives is glory.

(Sirach 44:3) 
Their people walk with them, and recount their heroic acts.

(Sirach 44:4) 
The Lord has shown mercy to the elect, whose accomplishments are miracles. They never wavered in their devotion to God.

(Sirach 44:5) 
Their good works continue in their descendants, their holy heritage.

(Sirach 44:6) 
Their descendants will keep the covenant, and their children will be guided by them.

(Sirach 44:7) 
Their descendants will endure forever, and their glory will never be forgotten.

(Sirach 44:8) 
Their bodies were buried in peace, and their names live on for all generations.

(Sirach 44:9) 
The wise will speak with wisdom, and their righteousness recounts the praises of God.

(Sirach 44:10) 
Many will sing his praises, and his memory will never fade.

(Sirach 44:11) 
His memory is as sweet as honey in the mouth, and like music at a banquet of wine.

(Sirach 44:12) 
He was disciplined in his studies, in his teachings, and in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 44:13) 
The saints will not fail in their good works, and their works of mercy will endure.

(Sirach 44:14) 
Their good works will endure, and their holiness will not be forsaken.

(Sirach 44:15) 
Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives on through all generations.

(Sirach 44:16) 
The wise leave a good reputation, which they announce in the midst of the people.

(Sirach 44:17) 
The teachings of the wise are like jewels of honor, and they are honored wherever they appear.

(Sirach 44:18) 
But the foolish seize the earth, and their glory is quickly forgotten.

(Sirach 44:19) 
A wicked son diminishes his father's glory, and one born without fear is held in contempt.

(Sirach 44:20) 
A righteous son honors his father, and in the sight of the Lord, he vindicates his mother.

(Sirach 44:21) 
Those who fear God honor their parents, and they will serve their masters as though they were their own children.

(Sirach 44:22) 
In deed and word, honor your father and mother, and give them joy at all times.

(Sirach 44:23) 
With all your heart, bless your father, and pray for the sins of your mother.

(Sirach 44:24) 
Those who show mercy to their father are like those who store up treasures, and those who honor their mother store up treasures.

(Sirach 44:25) 
Those who fear God honor their parents and serve them as they would their masters.

(Sirach 44:26) 
Son, support your father in his old age, and do not grieve him in his life.

(Sirach 44:27) 
Even if his mind fails, be patient with him, and do not despise him in your strength.

(Sirach 44:28) 
The alms given to your father will never be forgotten, and for the sins of your mother, you will find refreshment.

(Sirach 44:29) 
In the day of your tribulation, remember them, and your sins will melt away like frost in the heat.

(Sirach 44:30) 
Whoever abandons their father is like a blasphemer, and whoever angers their mother is cursed by God.

(Sirach 44:31) 
Son, persevere in your work with gentleness, and you will abound in their love.

(Sirach 44:32) 
The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself in all things, and you will find favor with God.

(Sirach 44:33) 
For the power of God alone is great, and He is honored by the humble.

(Sirach 44:34) 
Do not seek things that are too high for you, and do not search into matters that are beyond your reach.

(Sirach 44:35) 
But always reflect on the commandments given to you, and do not involve yourself with too many of His works.

(Sirach 44:36) 
You do not need to involve yourself with the things that are hidden from you.

(Sirach 44:37) 
Do not become overly involved in your own affairs, and do not meddle in too many works.

(Sirach 44:38) 
For many things are shown to you which are beyond human understanding.

(Sirach 44:39) 
And the deception of many impious people will mislead them, and their wicked hearts will bring them down.

(Sirach 44:40) 
The heart of the hard-hearted will be burdened with sorrow, and the wicked will add sin upon sin.

(Sirach 44:41) 
In their afflictions, they will add more sins.

(Sirach 44:42) 
In their sorrows, they will add to their impiety.

(Sirach 44:43) 
The arrogance of the wicked is not justified, for the wicked are like a thorn in the wind.

(Sirach 44:44) 
The just man believes in the law, and his hope is in the law of the Lord.

(Sirach 44:45) 
Those who fear God do good, and those who practice justice will acquire it, and children will greet them as if they were a virtuous mother.

(Sirach 44:46) 
The children of the just are like a virtuous mother, and they will rejoice in them.

(Sirach 44:47) 
Those who fear the Lord will have a good end, and on the day of their completion, they will find grace.

(Sirach 45:1) 
The priesthood of Aaron and Moses began on the day when God gave them their mission.

(Sirach 45:2) 
The Lord then consecrated them, just as brothers.

(Sirach 45:3) 
He made them holy by His power and proved their faithfulness.

(Sirach 45:4) 
God chose them from among men, and then gave them the law of life.

(Sirach 45:5) 
God made a covenant with them that would last forever, and he showed them his ways.

(Sirach 45:6) 
He made them glorious and gave them great strength.

(Sirach 45:7) 
He gave them priestly garments and beautiful ornaments, clothing them in all that was needed.

(Sirach 45:8) 
Their duties were holy, and they were always mindful of God's honor.

(Sirach 45:9) 
They fulfilled their duties during their own time, and God was with them.

(Sirach 45:10) 
Their good works are remembered to this day.

(Sirach 45:11) 
Other men were anointed kings and given priestly duties.

(Sirach 45:12) 
And Moses, like Aaron, was honored in the sight of God and men.

(Sirach 45:13) 
The Lord blessed him and gave him a place of honor in His sanctuary.

(Sirach 45:14) 
He gave him authority over the various nations and distributed the tribes of Israel to him.

(Sirach 45:15) 
He gave Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, the eternal law and the covenant of peace.

(Sirach 45:16) 
He made an everlasting covenant with him and gave him the priesthood over the nation, glorifying him.

(Sirach 45:17) 
He placed him over the holy people, and he confirmed for him and his sons the right to offer incense and sacrifices to God.

(Sirach 45:18) 
And his priestly sons ministered to him, along with Moses and his anointed ones.

(Sirach 45:19) 
In his own time, Moses completed the work, and his glory increased.

(Sirach 45:20) 
He distributed the portions of the nations, dividing them among the twelve tribes.

(Sirach 45:21) 
He gave him the inheritance of the holy things, and all the best first fruits.

(Sirach 45:22) 
He extended his hand in sacrifice and offered sacrifices of libation as a sweet fragrance.

(Sirach 45:23) 
He glorified Aaron and blessed him, giving him an inheritance.

(Sirach 45:24) 
To Moses, however, he gave the commandments and judgments for the people, and he showed him his glory.

(Sirach 45:25) 
He made Aaron, a holy man, very similar to himself: and gave him an everlasting crown and priesthood.

(Sirach 45:26) 
And he did the same for Moses.

(Sirach 45:27) 
The sons of Aaron multiplied through the generations, becoming a family and inheriting.

(Sirach 45:28) 
So also was David, to whom God gave an eternal kingdom.

(Sirach 45:29) 
And Solomon, who was a wise man, sat on the throne of his kingdom.

(Sirach 45:30) 
And they reigned with justice.

(Sirach 45:31) 
Their glory will be with them, and the glory of their fathers will be in the hands of their sons.

(Sirach 45:32) 
The wise are well-instructed in their words and in the signs of their wisdom.

(Sirach 45:33) 
A wise man's teachings are like the rain, and wisdom will always be proven right.

(Sirach 45:34) 
Now, praise and honor wise men.

(Sirach 45:35) 
For the learned will be judged by them, and judgment will be known from them.

(Sirach 45:36) 
They will be praised among the nations and honored in the city.

(Sirach 46:1) 
Samuel, the strong one, powerful in his works, judged the Lord.

(Sirach 46:2) 
Afterwards, he slept with his ancestors and showed the Lord the king.

(Sirach 46:3) 
He gave anointing upon his head and appointed David as king.

(Sirach 46:4) 
A holy man, he judged the people and sanctified the people.

(Sirach 46:5) 
He surrounded his enemies, roaring like a lion on the path.

(Sirach 46:6) 
He gave him power forever and established a covenant with his descendants.

(Sirach 46:7) 
He sent Jacobites from among the nations and gave them land in division, distributing them according to their parts and the tribes of Israel.

(Sirach 46:8) 
And their memory is blessed forever.

(Sirach 46:9) 
Like the sun, Elias illuminated and knew the Lord.

(Sirach 46:10) 
In the word of the Lord, he judged, and at his word, the judge ceased.

(Sirach 46:11) 
He raised the dead from death and, from the abyss, at the word of the Most High.

(Sirach 46:12) 
He cast down kings and the glorious into ruin.

(Sirach 46:13) 
He heard the rebuke on Sinai and the judgments of vengeance at Horeb.

(Sirach 46:14) 
He anointed kings for repentance and the prophets after him, as a testimony of eternity.

(Sirach 46:15) 
He was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fire.

(Sirach 46:16) 
He is written in the judgments of the times, to appease the wrath of the Lord, in time.

(Sirach 46:17) 
He turned the heart of the father to the son and restored the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 46:18) 
Blessed are those who saw you and were in your friendship.

(Sirach 46:19) 
For we live by life, but after death, such a name will not be.

(Sirach 46:20) 
Elias was covered in a whirlwind of fire, and Elisha was filled with his spirit.

(Sirach 46:21) 
In his days, he did not fear the ruler, nor did any power disturb him.

(Sirach 46:22) 
His word surpassed all things, and in his life, he performed miracles.

(Sirach 46:23) 
He did not trust his heart, nor did he fear flesh, because he was strengthened in the faith of the Lord.

(Sirach 46:24) 
After death, his body prophesied, and even after his passing, he prophesied.

(Sirach 46:25) 
In his life, he did signs, and in his death, wonders.

(Sirach 46:26) 
In all these, the people did not acquiesce, nor did they depart from their sins, until they were expelled from their land.

(Sirach 46:27) 
And among all the nations who did not believe and did not work miracles.

(Sirach 46:28) 
In the days of Noah, they saw, and were saved: and in Noah, the world was created.

(Sirach 46:29) 
He was found to be a friend of God, and in the judgment, he was found just.

(Sirach 46:30) 
In temptation, he was found perfect, and he was found just.

(Sirach 46:31) 
Therefore, God gave him a covenant with Noah: that it would be forever over all flesh.

(Sirach 46:32) 
Abraham, the great father of many nations, and there is no one like him found in glory.

(Sirach 46:33) 
He kept the law of the Most High and made a covenant with Him.

(Sirach 46:34) 
In his flesh, he established a covenant, and in temptation, he was found faithful.

(Sirach 46:35) 
Therefore, he confirmed it to him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed.

(Sirach 46:36) 
That he would multiply his seed like the dust of the earth and exalt his seed like the stars.

(Sirach 46:37) 
And He gave him an inheritance, from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

(Sirach 46:38) 
Isaac and Jacob He blessed and gave them a blessing.

(Sirach 46:39) 
He placed the blessing of all nations upon their heads and placed His covenant and love in Jacob.

(Sirach 46:40) 
He sanctified him in His sanctifications and preserved him from temptations and delivered him.

(Sirach 46:41) 
He magnified him in the sight of all men and established him among all nations.

(Sirach 46:42) 
The covenant was confirmed in him, and the blessing He gave him, and He distributed it among the parts.

(Sirach 46:43) 
He gave the inheritance in parts and divided the twelve tribes.

(Sirach 47:1) 
The prophet Elijah arose like a fire, and his word burned like a torch.

(Sirach 47:2) 
He brought famine upon them, and in his zeal he reduced them to a few.

(Sirach 47:3) 
By the Word of the Lord, he closed the sky, and three times he brought down fire.

(Sirach 47:4) 
How glorious you were, Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! Who is like you in glory?

(Sirach 47:5) 
You raised the dead from death, and from the underworld at the command of the Most High.

(Sirach 47:6) 
You brought kings to ruin, and the mighty from their beds.

(Sirach 47:7) 
You heard judgment on Sinai, and judgments of vengeance on Horeb.

(Sirach 47:8) 
You anointed kings for repentance, and established prophets to succeed you.

(Sirach 47:9) 
You were taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses.

(Sirach 47:10) 
You are recorded in the judgments of the ages, to appease the wrath of the Lord, so as to reconcile the heart of the father to the son.

(Sirach 47:11) 
And restore the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 47:12) 
Blessed are those who saw you, and were adorned with your friendship.

(Sirach 47:13) 
For while we live, we have life, and after death we will have nothing like it.

(Sirach 47:14) 
Elijah was covered in spirit, and Elisha was filled with his spirit. In his days, he did not fear a prince, and no power could overcome him.

(Sirach 47:15) 
His word surpassed all things, and his heart prophesied.

(Sirach 47:16) 
He slept in peace, and his eye remained watchful even in sleep.

(Sirach 47:17) 
His signs are in their portions, and he is known among the nations.

(Sirach 47:18) 
In Elisha, a double spirit; he performed great signs and wonders, and judged by his word.

(Sirach 47:19) 
He feared no one, and no human spirit could overcome him.

(Sirach 47:20) 
His heart did not waver, and nothing could disturb his will.

(Sirach 47:21) 
His works are holy and glorious, and his wonders have been performed in the sight of all.

(Sirach 47:22) 
Therefore, he did not give up in his sins, and after his death, his body prophesied.

(Sirach 47:23) 
In his life, he worked wonders, and in death, he performed miracles.

(Sirach 47:24) 
In all these things, the people did not believe, and they did not cease from their sins until he was taken away from the earth.

(Sirach 47:25) 
And the heart of the people did not understand, nor did they know the works of God and the works of His hands.

(Sirach 47:26) 
He was like a tree in his works; and afterwards there were those who would judge him.

(Sirach 47:27) 
This is concerning the people; and later, concerning all nations.

(Sirach 47:28) 
For who will search out the strength of the Lord? And who will declare His glory?

(Sirach 47:29) 
For who is great in His works? And who will change His works?

(Sirach 47:30) 
God made all things, and this is good in His sight.

(Sirach 47:31) 
Each one for their own works.

(Sirach 47:32) 
For he who says: 'This is what is,' what is it? And who will honor His works?

(Sirach 47:33) 
After these things, we will praise the holy men in their works, who did not fail in the fear of Him.

(Sirach 47:34) 
Nations were saved in their own righteousness.

(Sirach 47:35) 
The people of the Lord were saved in their own righteousness.

(Sirach 47:36) 
And we will praise the glorious in glory, who gave glory in the fear of the Lord.

(Sirach 47:37) 
There were those who did not have, that they might work: in the mercies which were given, they were justified.

(Sirach 47:38) 
Some remained with their seed: and some were not born.

(Sirach 47:39) 
This one was glorified, and that one was offered up.

(Sirach 47:40) 
He gathered wealth and treasured it like silver.

(Sirach 47:41) 
And he was not found in his works; and he became a stranger.

(Sirach 47:42) 
His sons and his grandsons were sinners.

(Sirach 47:43) 
From his lineage, seed remained, and from the nations.

(Sirach 47:44) 
From a good father, inheritance remains in the sons.

(Sirach 47:45) 
But even from him, inheritance has perished to the wicked sons.

(Sirach 47:46) 
Those who are not just have lost their inheritance, and have perished with the sinners.

(Sirach 47:47) 
Love your friends more than gold and silver.

(Sirach 47:48) 
For a good treasure is better than gold and silver.

(Sirach 47:49) 
Life and soul are better in the grace of love.

(Sirach 47:50) 
There is no better treasure than gold, and a good man is better than silver.

(Sirach 47:51) 
A friend and neighbor in a time of need, is found in the day of tribulation.

(Sirach 47:52) 
Life is not to be compared to gold, and the best companionship of a good man is beyond measure.

(Sirach 47:53) 
Love piety more than gold and silver, more than treasures.

(Sirach 48:1) 
The prophet Elijah rose up, glowing like a fire. His words were like a torch that burned.

(Sirach 48:2) 
He brought them famine, and in his zeal, he made them few in number.

(Sirach 48:3) 
By the Lord's word, he closed the sky, and he made fire fall three times.

(Sirach 48:4) 
How glorious you became, Elijah, in your wonders! Who is like you in glory?

(Sirach 48:5) 
You raised the dead from death and from the underworld by the word of the Most High.

(Sirach 48:6) 
You brought kings to ruin, and easily broke them from on high.

(Sirach 48:7) 
You heard judgment on Sinai and the judgments of vengeance on Horeb.

(Sirach 48:8) 
You anointed kings to do penance and prophets in their lineage.

(Sirach 48:9) 
You were received into a fiery whirlwind in a chariot of fiery horses.

(Sirach 48:10) 
You are written in the judgments of the times, to placate the Lord's anger, to turn the father's heart to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

(Sirach 48:11) 
Blessed are those who saw you and were adorned in your friendship.

(Sirach 48:12) 
For we also live, but when we die, we will die with the dead.

(Sirach 48:13) 
Elijah was taken up in the whirlwind, and Elisha was filled with his spirit. In his days, he did not fear a prince, and no one had power over him.

(Sirach 48:14) 
His word surpassed all power. He performed signs in his life and wonders in his death.

(Sirach 48:15) 
In all these things, the people did not repent, and they did not turn away from their sins, until they were cast out of their land and scattered throughout the earth.

(Sirach 48:16) 
The nation was forsaken, and there was no one to show them mercy.

(Sirach 48:17) 
I remember Jeremiah the prophet, who was sanctified from the womb to be a prophet, to destroy, to plant, and to build.

(Sirach 48:18) 
Who in a holy vision brought rain and sent fire upon the people from heaven.

(Sirach 48:19) 
Who was denounced for bloodshed and who gave rebuke to sinners before he died.

(Sirach 48:20) 
Who ascended into heaven, and now gathers souls by the Lord's hand, and sees with power in all things.

(Sirach 48:21) 
Concerning Ezekiel, who saw the vision of glory, which was shown to him in the chariot of the cherubim.

(Sirach 48:22) 
For he remembers enemies in the rain and gives thanks to those who do good.

(Sirach 48:23) 
And of the twelve prophets: may their bones sprout from their place, for they consoled Jacob, and they consoled with great faith.

(Sirach 48:24) 
How shall we honor Zerubbabel? He became like a signet ring on the right hand.

(Sirach 48:25) 
Likewise, Joshua, the son of Nun, who became great in his power in his days.

(Sirach 48:26) 
He gave testimony about him, that after the setting of the sun, he made the sun stand still, and one day, he made double.

(Sirach 48:27) 
He called upon the Most High with strength, surrounding them in battle.

(Sirach 48:28) 
He gave testimony to him in glory, that he fulfilled before God until the end.

(Sirach 48:29) 
In the testimonies of Moses, the holy man knew, and David in his mercies.

(Sirach 48:30) 
Solomon rested in peace, and in his days, the sun was disturbed.

(Sirach 48:31) 
For they did their works and went to their rest.

(Sirach 48:32) 
For in all things, they taught the people, and in them, their doctrine.

(Sirach 48:33) 
Their memory rises, and their name will not fail.

(Sirach 48:34) 
A nation will proclaim wisdom, and their praise will be spoken in the church.

(Sirach 49:1) 
The memory of Josias is like a pleasant scent, like honey in the mouth, like music at a wine banquet.

(Sirach 49:2) 
He turned away from sin, leading his people in the right way, removing the abominations of iniquity.

(Sirach 49:3) 
His heart turned toward God and was not weakened by impiety.

(Sirach 49:4) 
Beyond David, Ezechias, and Josias, all others sinned, forsaking the law of the Most High, forgetting His blessings.

(Sirach 49:5) 
The mighty kings of Judea grew weak, failing in wars.

(Sirach 49:6) 
They abandoned the law of God, despised His covenant, and did not follow the commandments of the righteous, nor did they walk the path of justice, and so they were all destroyed.

(Sirach 49:7) 
The Lord saw their impiety because they had departed from Him.

(Sirach 49:8) 
So He divided them among the nations, scattering them across the earth.

(Sirach 49:9) 
He brought in strangers against them and multiplied their enemies in the land.

(Sirach 49:10) 
Their deeds were changed; in all their ways they were altered.

(Sirach 49:11) 
But in the days of Josias, there was peace, and the land rejoiced in his rest.

(Sirach 49:12) 
His heart was strengthened towards the Lord, and he was not weakened by impiety.

(Sirach 49:13) 
For all that was before him, and all that came after him, brought impiety and forgetfulness of iniquity upon the earth.

(Sirach 49:14) 
And his works were just in the eyes of the Lord, and in all his life.

(Sirach 49:15) 
The rest of the words of Josias, his mercy toward the Lord, his piety, and all that he did, are written in the book of the kings of Judea.

(Sirach 49:16) 
And so Josias, son of Amon, became king of Judea.

(Sirach 49:17) 
The memory of Josias, they make in his composition like a scent, and like honey in the mouth, like music at a wine banquet.

(Sirach 49:18) 
And these things in his life were for all the people, to the glory of God.

(Sirach 49:19) 
And Josias acted to put down impiety and removed the abominations of iniquity.

(Sirach 49:20) 
He directed his heart to the Lord and was strengthened in the times of the wicked.

(Sirach 49:21) 
Moreover, the works of David and Solomon, their magnificence and holiness, are written in the book of Kings.

(Sirach 49:22) 
Indeed, none of those who were on earth are compared to Josias in the works of God.

(Sirach 49:23) 
Because in all his works, he acted well and also he was glorious.

(Sirach 49:24) 
Solomon was a father of peace; and God gave him peace, and it ceased all his days.

(Sirach 49:25) 
And Solomon acted and built the house of God in his days.

(Sirach 49:26) 
Although the wisdom of Solomon was great and glorious, in parables, proverbs, sentences, and answers,

(Sirach 49:27) 
In the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, he gathered gold like a pond and multiplied silver like sand.

(Sirach 49:28) 
You placed it in his womb, and from your wisdom, you gave it to him.

(Sirach 49:29) 
You exalted his honor and fulfilled his glory.

(Sirach 49:30) 
You gathered his enemies, and removed the wicked, and exalted his kingdom.

(Sirach 49:31) 
For the glory of Solomon illuminated even to a distant time, and his name among the nations was famous because of these things.

(Sirach 49:32) 
But insanity, pride, iniquity, and perversity corrupted his heart.

(Sirach 49:33) 
He divided the kingdom, and a rebellious kingdom rose up against him.

(Sirach 49:34) 
But the Lord will remain in all His blessings and does not abandon His graces, nor does He diminish His works; nor does He take away from His holy ones, nor does He change His works.

(Sirach 49:35) 
He left their remnants, and the names of His elect. And all His works endure forever.

(Sirach 50:1) 
The great high priest is a glory to his brothers, like the sun when it rises.

(Sirach 50:2) 
Like the moon during its days; when it is full it lights the whole world.

(Sirach 50:3) 
Feast days and the season of the months, those feasts make the celebration.

(Sirach 50:4) 
Like the shining sun, so he shines when in the Temple of God.

(Sirach 50:5) 
Like a rainbow, which brings glory during the cloud-filled days of a festival.

(Sirach 50:6) 
Like a rose in the springtime, and during the days of roses: so he is beautiful during his days.

(Sirach 50:7) 
Like the cedar that is raised up on the mountains of Lebanon, or like a palm tree standing tall.

(Sirach 50:8) 
So is he, when he is raised up in his days.

(Sirach 50:9) 
Like an olive tree with its fruit, or a cypress that has been raised in height.

(Sirach 50:10) 
When he put on the robe of glory, and was covered with perfect majesty, he ascended the holy altar.

(Sirach 50:11) 
Around the holy altar, the brilliance of the veil, is like a crown of palm branches, or like roses during the springtime.

(Sirach 50:12) 
Around him is a crown of glory, like the horns of a bull, or like a vessel of incense in the Temple.

(Sirach 50:13) 
The son of Aaron is like snow in the winter, or like a rose during the springtime.

(Sirach 50:14) 
Like fire and incense in the censer.

(Sirach 50:15) 
A golden vessel adorned with gems, with every sort of beauty.

(Sirach 50:16) 
After entering from the Temple, he is like the morning star coming from the cloud.

(Sirach 50:17) 
Like the moon in its fullness, and like the shining sun.

(Sirach 50:18) 
The call during the feast days, and like the rainbow in the cloud of glory.

(Sirach 50:19) 
Golden vessels, and hyacinthine ornaments, and garments of silk, and purple.

(Sirach 50:20) 
Chosen gifts, and the best donations.

(Sirach 50:21) 
Sweet bread, and the intoxication in the scent.

(Sirach 50:22) 
In this time, my heart was mindful, and my spirit was troubled.

(Sirach 50:23) 
I feared because of the fear of the Lord, and His glory.

(Sirach 50:24) 
I feared the multitude of sinners, and His glory.

(Sirach 50:25) 
And I extended my hand, and I implored and said:

(Sirach 50:26) 
I have sinned, and I have acted wickedly, and I have failed, and I was not worthy of Your sight.

(Sirach 50:27) 
Because I know that you do not judge mankind in any place.

(Sirach 50:28) 
If I give witness about my own works, I will not be exalted: because my works are many and evil.

(Sirach 50:29) 
If I am righteous, all my works are with Him: and I am not worthy.

(Sirach 50:30) 
Because behold, in Him is all my justice.

(Sirach 50:31) 
And of this I have acted wickedly, because I have done until the end.

(Sirach 50:32) 
And the Lord heard me.

(Sirach 50:33) 
And He turned my mourning into joy, and my tribulation into joy.

(Sirach 50:34) 
And this has been given back to me by the Lord, and glory was made for me before all.

(Sirach 50:35) 
Descend into humility, and I will bless the Lord, and I will praise Him.

(Sirach 50:36) 
Receive the doctrine, you who are ignorant, and place it in your hearts.

(Sirach 50:37) 
Because he who finds it is near.

(Sirach 50:38) 
Hear me, little ones, and like a rose in the field, sprout the scent.

(Sirach 50:39) 
And give the scent, like incense, and bloom with a flower, and place grace before Him.

(Sirach 50:40) 
Because God is great, and our Lord lives forever.

(Sirach 50:41) 
Amen, amen.

(Sirach 51:1) 
I will give thanks to You, O Lord my King, and I will praise You, my God, my Savior.

(Sirach 51:2) 
I confess Your holy name, because You have always been my protector and helper. You have freed my body from destruction, from the traps set by lying tongues, and from the lips of those who plot falsehoods.

(Sirach 51:3) 
You were always my helper. You rescued me from my enemies because of Your great mercy and Your holy name. You saved me from the jaws of those who prepared to devour me and from the hands of those who sought to kill me, and from the many troubles that I suffered,

(Sirach 51:4) 
and from the fire that surrounded me: I was delivered from the fire.

(Sirach 51:5) 
I will give thanks to You, I will praise You, and I will bless the Lord.

(Sirach 51:6) 
When I was still young, before I wandered astray, I sought wisdom openly.

(Sirach 51:7) 
And I prayed for her in the presence of the Temple.

(Sirach 51:8) 
And I sought her in the sight of the saints.

(Sirach 51:9) 
And afterwards, I realized that people do not have her.

(Sirach 51:10) 
So I went after her and sought her, and I entered into her way.

(Sirach 51:11) 
And I grasped her, and I blossomed, and I did not hide her.

(Sirach 51:12) 
My heart was troubled in her.

(Sirach 51:13) 
Therefore, I opened my mouth and spoke: “Listen, you powerful ones, and all you peoples, and incline your ears.

(Sirach 51:14) 
Pay attention, children, and adults, and hear the words of my mouth.

(Sirach 51:15) 
Teach your children doctrine, and bless them with her, because those who guard her, live.

(Sirach 51:16) 
The path of the just shines like the sun, and always goes towards perfection.

(Sirach 51:17) 
But the unjust do not know the ways of the just, and the seed of the wicked will burn like fire.

(Sirach 51:18) 
Guard yourself from evil, and do no evil, and do no injustice.

(Sirach 51:19) 
Flee from injustice, or it will seize you.

(Sirach 51:20) 
Son, do not involve yourself in vanity, and do not give your heart to things that are not necessary.

(Sirach 51:21) 
Turn away your eyes, and guard yourself from corruption.

(Sirach 51:22) 
Set your soul in righteous justice, and your works in the commandments of God.

(Sirach 51:23) 
Have faith with your neighbor, and work in the fear of God.

(Sirach 51:24) 
And know that all flesh withers like grass, and like the green leaves on a tree, and like the fruit that falls from a tree.

(Sirach 51:25) 
Because all flesh will quickly fail, but He who made all things, will endure.

(Sirach 51:26) 
Do not fear the judgment of death. Remember that those who came before you and those who will come after you, will pass away.

(Sirach 51:27) 
All flesh withers like a leaf, but he who is justified is like an ever-living tree.

(Sirach 51:28) 
The unjust falls like a dead tree, and his glory, once pushed, disappears like smoke.

(Sirach 51:29) 
Because good works are like a strong tree, and good thought is like a strong root.

(Sirach 51:30) 
A good root gives good fruit.

(Sirach 51:31) 
Poverty and the lack of mercy, and justice and the fear of God. For in these is life.

(Sirach 51:32) 
He who keeps the law will acquire it, and the end of his fear, is wisdom.

(Sirach 51:33) 
For him who is not unjust, there is no fear, but in all his ways is confidence.

(Sirach 51:34) 
Blessed is he who has life with wisdom, and he who speaks with sense, and he who meditates on justice, and he who considers the wisdom of God with understanding.

(Sirach 51:35) 
For if you do what pleases God, you will live, and you will be justified in all your works.

(Sirach 51:36) 
And then I will say: 'Give to the Lord everything that you do, and in due time, offer your sacrifice to Him.'

(Sirach 51:37) 
Give thanks to Him, make sacrifices of justice, and hope in Him.

(Isaiah 1:1) 
This is the vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah.

(Isaiah 1:2) 
Listen, universe. Listen, Earth, for the Lord has spoken. “I have raised up children, but they have rejected me.”

(Isaiah 1:3) 
The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel doesn't know me, and my people haven't understood me.

(Isaiah 1:4) 
Woe to the sinful nation, to a people burdened with iniquity, to the evil seed, to the wicked sons! They have forsaken the Lord, blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, and turned back.

(Isaiah 1:5) 
Why will you be struck again, since you are adding to your sin? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is heavy.

(Isaiah 1:6) 
From the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds, bruises, and open sores that are not bound up or softened with oil.

(Isaiah 1:7) 
Your land is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. In your presence, foreigners devour your land, and it is desolate as though destroyed by enemies.

(Isaiah 1:8) 
And the daughter of Zion will be left like a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city that is destroyed.

(Isaiah 1:9) 
Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have been like Sodom, and like Gomorrah.

(Isaiah 1:10) 
Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom. Give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.

(Isaiah 1:11) 
“What are your many sacrifices to me?” says the Lord. “I am full of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts, and I don’t want the blood of calves, lambs, or goats.”

(Isaiah 1:12) 
When you come before me, who has required this of you, that you tread my courts?

(Isaiah 1:13) 
Don’t offer any further sacrifice in vain. Incense is an abomination to me. New moons, sabbaths, and other festivals I cannot endure. Your iniquity and your gatherings!

(Isaiah 1:14) 
Your new moons and your appointed feasts, my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.

(Isaiah 1:15) 
And when you stretch out your hands, I will turn my eyes away from you. And when you multiply your prayer, I will not hear, for your hands are full of blood.

(Isaiah 1:16) 
Wash yourselves, be clean. Remove the evil of your thoughts from before my eyes. Stop doing evil!

(Isaiah 1:17) 
Learn to do good. Seek judgment. Help the oppressed. Judge for the orphan. Defend the widow.

(Isaiah 1:18) 
“Come now, and let us reason together,” says the Lord. “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”

(Isaiah 1:19) 
If you are willing, and if you listen to me, you shall eat the good of the land.

(Isaiah 1:20) 
But if you are not willing, and provoke me to anger, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 1:21) 
How has the faithful city become a prostitute, full of judgment? Justice dwelt in her, but now murderers.

(Isaiah 1:22) 
Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.

(Isaiah 1:23) 
Your leaders are disloyal. They are companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes. They follow after rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, and the widow's case does not come before them.

(Isaiah 1:24) 
Therefore, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Woe! I will console myself over my adversaries and take vengeance on my enemies.”

(Isaiah 1:25) 
I will turn my hand against you, and I will melt your dross as with lye, and I will remove all your tin.

(Isaiah 1:26) 
I will restore your judges as they were at first, and your counselors as in the beginning. After that, you will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.

(Isaiah 1:27) 
Zion will be redeemed with judgment, and those who turn to her with righteousness.

(Isaiah 1:28) 
And the destruction of the wicked and sinners alike; and those who have forsaken the Lord will be consumed.

(Isaiah 1:29) 
For they will be ashamed of the idols, those things that they desired, and they will be ashamed of the groves which they have chosen.

(Isaiah 1:30) 
For they will be like an oak whose leaves wither, and like a garden whose water fails.

(Isaiah 1:31) 
And the strong will be like tow, and his work like a spark, and they will burn together, and there is no one to extinguish them.

(Isaiah 2:1) 
This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw regarding Judah and Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 2:2) 
In the end times, the mountain of the Lord's temple will be prepared, at the top of all the mountains, and will be raised above all hills. And all the nations will flow to it.

(Isaiah 2:3) 
And many people will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths.” For the law will come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 2:4) 
He will judge the nations and rebuke many people. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.

(Isaiah 2:5) 
O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.

(Isaiah 2:6) 
For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been filled with all sorts of wickedness like before. They are filled with fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and their young men are in league with foreigners.

(Isaiah 2:7) 
Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. Their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.

(Isaiah 2:8) 
Their land is filled with idols: the work of their hands, what their fingers have made.

(Isaiah 2:9) 
So man bows down, and the man is humbled, and you do not forgive them.

(Isaiah 2:10) 
Enter into the rock, and hide yourself in the dust, from the face of the fear of the Lord and from the glory of His majesty.

(Isaiah 2:11) 
The eyes of the proud men are humbled, and the loftiness of the men will be bowed down. And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

(Isaiah 2:12) 
For the day of the Lord of hosts will be against all who are proud and lofty, against everyone who is lifted up, and he will be humbled.

(Isaiah 2:13) 
And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lofty, and against all the oaks of Bashan,

(Isaiah 2:14) 
and against all the high mountains, and against all the elevated hills,

(Isaiah 2:15) 
and against every high tower, and against every fortified wall,

(Isaiah 2:16) 
and against all the ships of Tarshish and against everything that seems like a beautiful picture.

(Isaiah 2:17) 
So the loftiness of man will be bowed down, and the pride of men will be humbled. And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

(Isaiah 2:18) 
And the idols will utterly vanish.

(Isaiah 2:19) 
And men will enter into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth, from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He arises to strike the earth.

(Isaiah 2:20) 
In that day, a man will throw away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which he made for himself to worship moles and bats,

(Isaiah 2:21) 
so that he may enter the caverns of the rocks and the crevices of the cliffs, from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He arises to strike the earth.

(Isaiah 2:22) 
Therefore cease to be proud of man, in whose nostrils is breath, for he is esteemed, of what account is he?

(Isaiah 3:1) 
Behold, the Lord of hosts will take away all the bread and all the water that is needed to live from Jerusalem and Judah,

(Isaiah 3:2) 
He will remove their strong and brave soldiers, their judges, their prophets, their fortune-tellers, and their elders,

(Isaiah 3:3) 
their rulers, those held in high regard, their counselors, their skilled craftsmen, and those eloquent in speech.

(Isaiah 3:4) 
And I will make children their princes, and the immature will rule them.

(Isaiah 3:5) 
The people will be in chaos, one person against another, each against his neighbor. The child will insult the elder, and the vulgar will disrespect the noble.

(Isaiah 3:6) 
Surely a man will seize his brother in the house of his father, saying, “You have a cloak, so be our leader, and under your hand, let there be a sword.”

(Isaiah 3:7) 
In that day, he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a physician; for in my house there is no bread nor clothing. Do not make me the leader of the people.”

(Isaiah 3:8) 
For Jerusalem will fall, and Judah will be brought down, because their language and the foolishness of their deeds are against the Lord, provoking the eyes of His majesty.

(Isaiah 3:9) 
The expression on their faces testifies against them, and they proclaim their sin like Sodom, without hiding it. Woe to their souls, for they have brought evil upon themselves.

(Isaiah 3:10) 
Tell the just that it is well, because they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.

(Isaiah 3:11) 
Woe to the wicked! For the reward of his hands will be given to him.

(Isaiah 3:12) 
My people, those who bless you are deceiving you and turning the path of your footsteps upside down.

(Isaiah 3:13) 
The Lord stands in judgment, and He stands to judge the peoples.

(Isaiah 3:14) 
The Lord will come to judgment with the elders of His people and its princes, for you have consumed the vineyard, and the plunder of the poor is in your houses.

(Isaiah 3:15) 
Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 3:16) 
And the Lord said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, walking with outstretched necks, ogling with their eyes, strutting as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,

(Isaiah 3:17) 
therefore the Lord will scrape the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will expose their hair.”

(Isaiah 3:18) 
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their sandals, the crescents, and the necklaces,

(Isaiah 3:19) 
the bracelets, the pendants, and the headbands, the anklets, the sashes, and the perfume bottles,

(Isaiah 3:20) 
the rings, the mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.

(Isaiah 3:21) 
Instead of perfume, there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of elaborate hairstyles, baldness; instead of a robe, a sackcloth.

(Isaiah 3:22) 
Your men will fall by the sword, and your strong ones in battle.

(Isaiah 3:23) 
And its gates will lament and mourn, and the land, desolated, will sit.

(Isaiah 3:24) 
And seven women will seize one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes; only let us be called by your name, take away our reproach.”

(Isaiah 3:25) 
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their sandals, the crescents, the necklaces, and the pendants,

(Isaiah 3:26) 
the dresses, the cloaks, the veils, and the shawls.

(Isaiah 3:27) 
And there will be decay instead of fragrance, a rope instead of a belt, baldness instead of elaborate hairstyles, and a sackcloth instead of a robe.

(Isaiah 3:28) 
And the daughter of Zion will remain like a shelter in a vineyard, like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, and like a city that has been destroyed.

(Isaiah 4:1) 
And in that day, seven women will take hold of one man, saying: "We will eat our own bread, and dress ourselves in our own clothes; only let us be called by your name, and take away our disgrace."

(Isaiah 4:2) 
In that day, the Messiah will be the glory and honor of God, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and glory of those of Israel who are saved.

(Isaiah 4:3) 
And it will be that those who are left in Zion, and those who remain in Jerusalem, will be holy, all who are written in the book of life in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 4:4) 
When the Lord washes away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purges the blood of Jerusalem from within her, by the spirit of justice and the spirit of fire.

(Isaiah 4:5) 
The Lord will create a cloud by day and smoke by night over the whole area of Mount Zion, and over all its assemblies; the glory will be a defense for all.

(Isaiah 4:6) 
There will be a tent to provide shade from the heat of the day, and a place of refuge and a shelter from the storm and from the rain.

(Isaiah 5:1) 
I will sing to my Beloved a song of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My Beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.

(Isaiah 5:2) 
He enclosed it, and cleared the stones from it. He planted the best vines. He built a tower in the middle, and he built a wine press in it. He waited for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.

(Isaiah 5:3) 
So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.

(Isaiah 5:4) 
What more could I have done for my vineyard, that I have not done? Why did I wait for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes?

(Isaiah 5:5) 
Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down.

(Isaiah 5:6) 
I will make it desolate; it shall not be pruned, nor shall it be tilled. Thorns and thistles shall come up, and I will command the clouds not to rain upon it.

(Isaiah 5:7) 
For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are its chosen plants. I waited for judgment, but behold, oppression; and for justice, but behold, a cry.

(Isaiah 5:8) 
Woe to those who join house to house, and add field to field, so that you come to another's property. Will you alone dwell in the midst of the earth?

(Isaiah 5:9) 
In my ears, the Lord of hosts said, "Surely many houses shall be desolate, great and beautiful, without inhabitant.

(Isaiah 5:10) 
For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath of wine, and a bushel of seed shall yield only a quart.

(Isaiah 5:11) 
Woe to those who rise early in the morning to follow drunkenness, who linger over wine until late in the evening, and are inflamed by wine.

(Isaiah 5:12) 
In harp and lyre, tambourine and flute, and wine, are their works, but they do not regard the work of the Lord, nor do they consider the work of his hands.

(Isaiah 5:13) 
Therefore my people have been led captive, because they have no knowledge, and their glory is famished, and their multitude is dried up with thirst.

(Isaiah 5:14) 
Therefore hell has enlarged its soul, and opened its mouth without limit, and its glorious and famous people shall go down there.

(Isaiah 5:15) 
And the man shall be bowed down, and the mighty man shall be brought low, and the eyes of the proud shall be humbled.

(Isaiah 5:16) 
And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice.

(Isaiah 5:17) 
And the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat shall be for the wanderers.

(Isaiah 5:18) 
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with a cart rope.

(Isaiah 5:19) 
Who say, "Let him hasten, and let his work come quickly, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!"

(Isaiah 5:20) 
Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

(Isaiah 5:21) 
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

(Isaiah 5:22) 
Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink!

(Isaiah 5:23) 
Who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the justice of the just!

(Isaiah 5:24) 
Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, so their root shall be rottenness, and their flower shall go up like dust in the wind: because they have despised the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 5:25) 
Therefore the anger of the Lord has been kindled against his people, and he has stretched out his hand against them, and struck them, and the mountains were troubled, and they were made as corpses in the middle of the streets.

(Isaiah 5:26) 
For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.

(Isaiah 5:27) 
He will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and he will whistle to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they will come quickly, swiftly.

(Isaiah 5:28) 
There is none who is weary or stumbles among them; none will slumber or sleep. Nor will the belt of their loins be untied, nor the strap of their sandals be broken.

(Isaiah 5:29) 
Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hooves of their horses are like flint, and the wheels of their chariots are like a whirlwind.

(Isaiah 5:30) 
Their roaring is like a lion, and they will roar; and they will snarl like lions. They will roar like the sea, and if you look at the land, behold, there is darkness of distress, and the light is darkened in its gloom.

(Isaiah 6:1) 
In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on His throne, high and lifted up; and the temple was filled with the train of His robe.

(Isaiah 6:2) 
Above Him stood the Seraphim: each one had six wings; with two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.

(Isaiah 6:3) 
And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory."

(Isaiah 6:4) 
And the doorposts of the temple shook at the voice of the one crying out, and the house was filled with smoke.

(Isaiah 6:5) 
Then I said: "Woe is me, for I have been silent, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!"

(Isaiah 6:6) 
Then one of the Seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.

(Isaiah 6:7) 
And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips, and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin will be purged."

(Isaiah 6:8) 
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said: "Here I am, send me."

(Isaiah 6:9) 
And He said: "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'"

(Isaiah 6:10) 
Harden the hearts of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and I heal them."

(Isaiah 6:11) 
And I said: "How long, O Lord?" And He said: "Until the cities are laid waste, without inhabitants, and the houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate."

(Isaiah 6:12) 
And the Lord will take away the people, and there will be much left in the midst of the land.

(Isaiah 6:13) 
And if there is still a tenth part left in it, it will return, and it will be consumed, as a terebinth and as an oak that casts its root in the earth, the holy seed will stand in it.

(Isaiah 7:1) 
When Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to fight against it, but they couldn't conquer it.

(Isaiah 7:2) 
The news came to the house of David that the Syrians were allied with Ephraim. The heart of the king was disturbed, and the heart of his people was disturbed, just as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.

(Isaiah 7:3) 
Then the Lord said to Isaiah: "Go out to meet King Ahaz, you and your son, near the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the fuller's field."

(Isaiah 7:4) 
Say to him, 'Be careful, and keep calm. Don't be afraid, and don't let your heart be troubled by the two smoldering stumps of these firebrands, in the fury of Rezin, the Syrians, and the son of Remaliah.'

(Isaiah 7:5) 
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying:

(Isaiah 7:6) 
'Let us go against Judah, and weaken it, and divide it, and take it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in its midst.'

(Isaiah 7:7) 
Thus says the Lord God: "It shall not stand, and it shall not happen."

(Isaiah 7:8) 
Because the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin, and within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be so broken that it will no longer be a people.

(Isaiah 7:9) 
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. Unless you believe, you will not endure."

(Isaiah 7:10) 
The Lord then spoke again to Ahaz, saying:

(Isaiah 7:11) 
"Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God, either in the depths below or in the heights above."

(Isaiah 7:12) 
But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not test the Lord."

(Isaiah 7:13) 
Then Isaiah said: "Hear now, O house of David: Is it not enough for you to be wearying to men, that you are also wearying to God?

(Isaiah 7:14) 
Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call His name Emmanuel.

(Isaiah 7:15) 
He shall eat butter and honey, so that He may know how to reject evil and choose good.

(Isaiah 7:16) 
For before the Child knows how to refuse evil and choose good, the land which you dread shall be forsaken by the face of its two kings.

(Isaiah 7:17) 
The Lord will bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your father's house, days that have not come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah--the king of the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 7:18) 
In that day, the Lord will whistle for the fly that is in the farthest parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

(Isaiah 7:19) 
They will come, and they will all rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorns, and on all pastures.

(Isaiah 7:20) 
In that day, the Lord will shave with a hired razor, those who are beyond the River, with the king of Assyria's hand, the head, and the hair of the feet, and will take away the beard.

(Isaiah 7:21) 
And it shall be in that day, that a man shall feed a young cow, and two sheep.

(Isaiah 7:22) 
And because of the abundance of milk they give, he will eat butter, because butter and honey will be eaten by everyone who is left in the land.

(Isaiah 7:23) 
And it shall be in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand silver coins, shall be for thorns and briers.

(Isaiah 7:24) 
With arrows and bows they will come there, because all the land will be thorns and briers.

(Isaiah 7:25) 
And on all the mountains that are cultivated with a hoe, you will not fear thorns and briers, but they will be for grazing cattle and for the treading of sheep.

(Isaiah 8:1) 
And the Lord said to me: “Get a big book, and write on it with a human stylus: ‘Quick to plunder, hurry to take spoils.’”

(Isaiah 8:2) 
I called reliable witnesses to myself, including Uria the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah.

(Isaiah 8:3) 
I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: “Call his name, ‘Quick spoils, hurry to take spoils.’”

(Isaiah 8:4) 
Because before the child knows how to say ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ the power of Damascus will be taken away, along with the spoils of Samaria, before the king of the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 8:5) 
The Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Isaiah 8:6) 
“Because this people has rejected the waters of Siloë, which flow quietly, and has embraced Rasin, and the son of Remaliah:

(Isaiah 8:7) 
for this reason, see, the Lord will bring upon them the strong and abundant waters of the river, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and it will rise over all its channels, and will flow over all its banks.

(Isaiah 8:8) 
And it will go through Judah, overflowing and passing through, even to the neck: and it will stretch out its wings, filling the breadth of your land, O Emmanuel.

(Isaiah 8:9) 
Be joined together, you peoples, and be overcome, and listen, all those far off: strengthen yourselves, and be overcome. Gird yourselves, and be overcome.

(Isaiah 8:10) 
Take counsel together, and it will be broken: speak a word, and it will not happen: for God is with us.

(Isaiah 8:11) 
For thus the Lord said to me with a strong hand, and taught me not to go the way of this people, saying:

(Isaiah 8:12) 
“Do not call it a conspiracy: for everything that this people speaks is a conspiracy: and do not fear their fear, nor be afraid.

(Isaiah 8:13) 
Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: let Him be your fear, and let Him be your terror.

(Isaiah 8:14) 
And He will become a sanctuary, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense to the two houses of Israel, a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 8:15) 
And many will stumble against them, and will fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

(Isaiah 8:16) 
Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

(Isaiah 8:17) 
And I will wait for the Lord, who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in Him.

(Isaiah 8:18) 
Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given to me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.

(Isaiah 8:19) 
And when they say to you: “Seek out those who consult spirits and diviners, who chirp and mutter in their incantations: should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the living from the dead?

(Isaiah 8:20) 
Turn to the law and the testimony. If they do not speak according to this word, they will have no dawn.

(Isaiah 8:21) 
And it will pass through it, oppressed and hungry: and when it is hungry, it will be angry, and will curse its king and its God, and will look up.

(Isaiah 8:22) 
And it will look to the earth, and see distress and darkness, gloom and anguish, and a darkness oppressing, and it will not be able to escape from the anguish.

(Isaiah 9:1) 
The people who were walking in darkness saw a great light: those who inhabited the region of the shadow of death, light arose for them.

(Isaiah 9:2) 
You multiplied the people, but You didn't increase their joy: they will rejoice before you, just as those who rejoice in the harvest, in the way victors exult with seized spoils.

(Isaiah 9:3)

Because all the people and those who speak wickedness: in all these, His wrath is not turned away, but still His hand is outstretched.

(Isaiah 11:16) 
There will be a highway for the remnant of his people who are left from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.

(Isaiah 12:1)

(Isaiah 13:19) 
Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed them.

(Isaiah 13:20) 
It will never be inhabited again, nor will it be rebuilt from generation to generation. No Arab will pitch his tent there, and no shepherds will rest there.

(Isaiah 13:21) 
But wild animals will rest there, and the houses will be filled with jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and hairy demons will leap around.

(Isaiah 13:22) 
Hyenas will howl in its fortresses, and wild dogs will howl in its luxurious palaces. Its time is almost here, and its days will not be prolonged.

(Isaiah 14:1)

(Isaiah 14:3) 
“How has the oppressor ceased? The exactor, gone?

(Isaiah 14:4) 
The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers:

(Isaiah 14:5) 
who struck the peoples with an incurable wound in anger, who subdued the nations in fury, with an unceasing persecution.

(Isaiah 14:6) 
He struck peoples with an incurable wound, and subdued the nations with fury, with a persecution that never ceased.

(Isaiah 14:7) 
How have you fallen from the sky, O Lucifer, who rose in the morning? You have fallen to the earth, who wounded the nations?

(Isaiah 14:8) 
You said in your heart: “I will ascend into the sky, above the stars of God I will raise my throne, I will sit on the mountain of the covenant, on the sides of the north:”

(Isaiah 14:9) 
“I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the Most High.”

(Isaiah 14:10) 
Yet you will be brought down to hell, to the depths of the pit.

(Isaiah 14:11) 
Those who see you will gaze at you, and say: “Is this the man who troubled the earth, who moved kingdoms,

(Isaiah 14:12) 
who made the world a wilderness and destroyed cities, who did not open the prison to his bound ones?”

(Isaiah 14:13) 
All the kings of the nations have slept in glory, each in their own houses.

(Isaiah 14:14) 
But you are cast out of your tomb like an aborted branch, covered with the slain by the sword, and by those descending to the foundations of the pit, like a rotting corpse.

(Isaiah 14:15) 
You will not dwell with them in the tomb, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people: the seed of the wicked shall not be reckoned forever.

(Isaiah 14:16) 
Prepare slaughter for his sons, for the iniquity of their fathers, lest they rise, and inherit the land, and fill the face of the world with slaughter.

(Isaiah 14:20) 
“That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains I will trample him down: and his yoke shall be taken away from them, and his burden shall be removed from their shoulder.”

(Isaiah 14:21) 
This is the plan that I have planned over the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

(Isaiah 14:22) 
For the Lord of hosts has decreed, and who can make it void? And his hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?

(Isaiah 14:23) 
In the year that Ahaz died, this prophecy was made:

(Isaiah 14:24) 
Do not rejoice, O Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken: for from the root of the serpent will come forth a basilisk, and his seed will devour the bird.

(Isaiah 14:25) 
And the firstborn of the poor shall be fed, and the poor will rest in confidence: and I will destroy your root with famine, and I will kill your remnants.

Howl, gate; cry out, city; tremble, Philistia, all of you, for smoke will come from the north, and there is no one to retreat from his throng.

(Isaiah 14:27) 
What will be answered to the messengers of the nation? That the Lord has founded Zion, and in it the poor of his people will hope.

(Isaiah 15:1) 
The burden concerning Moab. In one night, Ar of Moab was destroyed, and it became silent.

(Isaiah 15:2) 
In one night, Moab was destroyed and became silent. In one night, Chîr of Moab was destroyed and became silent.

(Isaiah 15:3) 
The house of Moab goes up to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medaba. They have shaved off their beards and cut off every hand.

(Isaiah 15:4) 
In its streets, they wear sackcloth. On its rooftops and in its squares, there is wailing, weeping.

(Isaiah 15:5) 
My heart will wail for Moab. Its refugees flee to Zoar, and they weep as they go up the ascent of Luhith. On the road to Horonaim, they cry out a cry of destruction.

(Isaiah 15:6) 
The waters of Nimrim will be desolate, because the grass is dried up and the green things have withered, and there is nothing.

(Isaiah 15:7) 
Therefore, the remnant of their possessions and everything they saved will be carried across the stream to the weeping willows.

(Isaiah 15:8) 
For a cry has gone around the borders of Moab. Its wailing reached as far as Gallim and its cries as far as the well of Elim.

(Isaiah 15:9) 
For the waters of Dibon are full of blood. I will put more troubles on Dibon, and upon the lion of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.

(Isaiah 16:2) 
And the people of Moab will be like frightened birds, or like fledglings driven from their nests.

(Isaiah 16:3) 
Give advice and make decisions. Provide shade in the heat of the day, as if it were night. Protect the fugitives, and do not betray the wanderers.

(Isaiah 16:4) 
Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you; be a refuge from the destroyer. For the oppressor is finished, the devastation is complete, the plunder is ended, and the oppression has ceased.

(Isaiah 16:5) 
A throne will be established in mercy, and on it will sit, in truth, a judge of the house of David. He will be a just judge, seeking justice, and quick to do righteousness.

(Isaiah 16:6) 
We have heard of Moab's pride—exceedingly proud—and its arrogance and boastfulness. But his boasting is empty.

(Isaiah 16:7) 
Therefore Moab will wail for Moab, and everyone will lament. You will all mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.

(Isaiah 16:8) 
The terraces of Heshbon are destroyed. The lords of the nations have trampled the choice vines of Sibmah, whose branches extended across the sea, even to Jazer. They reached into the desert.

(Isaiah 16:9) 
So I weep with the weeping of Jazer over the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you, Heshbon and Elealeh, with my tears, because the shouts of those who trample the grapes have fallen on your summer fruits and your harvest.

(Isaiah 16:10) 
Gladness and joy are gone from the orchards; in the vineyards there will be no singing or shouting; those who tread the winepress will not tread out wine.

(Isaiah 16:11) 
Therefore, my heart mourns for Moab like a harp, and my inmost being for Kir-hareseth.

(Isaiah 16:12) 
When Moab appears, weary on the high places, and goes to its sanctuary to pray, it will not prevail.

(Isaiah 16:13) 
This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning Moab in the past.

(Isaiah 16:14) 
But now the Lord says: 'Within three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab's glory will be despised, with all its great multitude, and those who remain will be few and feeble.'

(Isaiah 17:1) 
The prophecy concerning Damascus. Pay attention! Damascus will fall, and it will be like a pile of rubble.

(Isaiah 17:2) 
The cities of Aroer are abandoned and left for flocks to roam, with no one to scare them away.

(Isaiah 17:3) 
Ephraim will be stripped of its fortifications, and Damascus of its kingdom, and the remnant of Syria will be like the glory of the sons of Israel, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 17:4) 
In that day, the glory of Jacob will be diminished, and his flesh will become lean.

(Isaiah 17:5) 
It will be like gathering the grain, and his arm will cut down the harvest. It will be like gathering the remaining grain in the valley of Rephaim.

(Isaiah 17:6) 
Only a few survivors will remain, like the grapes that are left after the harvest, or a few olives left on the branch, or a few olives on the top, or in the corners of the branches, says the Lord God of Israel.

(Isaiah 17:7) 
In that day, mankind will look to the One who made him, and his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 17:8) 
He will not look to the altars, the work of his own hands, nor will he look to what his fingers have made. He will not regard the groves or temples of idols.

(Isaiah 17:9) 
In that day, his fortified cities will be abandoned, like the abandoned forests and fields which the sons of Israel left. Everything will become desolation.

(Isaiah 17:10) 
Because you have forgotten God, your salvation, and have not remembered your strength, you will plant the planting of faithlessness and sow the seed of the foreigner.

On the day you plant, you will make a barrier. And in the morning your seed will blossom, but the harvest will be taken away on the day of your death.

(Isaiah 17:12) 
Woe to the multitude of peoples who roar like the roaring of the sea, and to the tumult of the nations who rage like the raging of mighty waters.

The nations rage like the raging of many waters, but God will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, like the dust of the mountains before the wind, and like a whirlwind before the storm.

(Isaiah 17:14) 
At evening, there is chaos. Before dawn, there is nothing. And then, pay attention, there is the despoiling of many.

(Isaiah 17:15) 
The peoples, like ash, are consumed. Fire has consumed them, and there is no one to extinguish it.

(Isaiah 17:16) 
There will be no one to have mercy on them. Therefore, they will bear their iniquities.

(Isaiah 17:17) 
The sword is prepared against them, and against the people who feared Me, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 18:1) 
Alas, O land where the drums sound, that is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

(Isaiah 18:2) 
who send emissaries across the sea, in papyrus boats upon the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation that has been torn and worn down: to a fearsome people from then and after: a nation expecting and trampled down, whose land the rivers divide.

(Isaiah 18:3) 
All who live on earth, when the banner is raised on the mountains, you will hear: and when the trumpet sounds, you will hear.

(Isaiah 18:4) 
For thus the Lord says to me: I will remain still, and I will consider in My place, like the summer in its heat, like clouds on the day of harvest.

(Isaiah 18:5) 
For before the harvest, when the grain is perfected, and the flower ripens, and turns into sour grapes, it will be cut with sickles, and the branches will be taken, and the vines will be cut down.

(Isaiah 18:6) 
And they will be left together for the birds of the mountains, and the beasts of the earth: and you will abandon them to the birds of summer, and all the beasts.

(Isaiah 18:7) 
At that time a gift will be brought to the Lord of hosts by a people torn and worn down, and by a fearsome people from then and beyond: from a nation expecting, and trampled down: whose land the rivers divide; to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, Mount Zion.

(Isaiah 19:1) 
The burden of Egypt: Behold, the Lord will come swiftly in a cloud, and He will enter Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof.

(Isaiah 19:2)

And the Lord shall be known by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and they shall worship with sacrifices and oblations: and they shall vow vows to the Lord, and perform them.

(Isaiah 19:14) 
And the Lord will strike Egypt with a plague, and will heal it: and they shall turn to the Lord, and He will hear them, and will heal them.

(Isaiah 19:15) 
In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians: and the Assyrian shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 19:16) 
In that day shall Egypt be the third to Israel, with the blessing of the Lord of hosts, saying: Blessed be my people of Egypt, and the work of my hands of the Assyrians, and my inheritance of Israel.

(Isaiah 20:1) 
In the year the general Tharthan was sent to Ashdod by Sargon, the king of Assyria. The general then fought against Ashdod, and captured it,

(Isaiah 20:2) 
At that time, the Lord gave a message through Isaiah, the son of Amoz. He said: “Go, take off the sackcloth from your waist, and take off your sandals.” Isaiah did as he was told, going about naked and barefoot.

(Isaiah 20:3) 
Then the Lord said: “As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years, as a sign and a wonder regarding Egypt and Ethiopia,

(Isaiah 20:4) 
So will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, both young and old. They will be naked and barefoot, and their backsides will be exposed—the humiliation of Egypt.

(Isaiah 20:5) 
They will be terrified and ashamed of Ethiopia and Egypt, their hope and glory. On that day, they will say, “That is what happened to our hope. We fled to Egypt for help, but the king of Assyria will come and destroy us.”

(Isaiah 21:1) 
This is a prophecy about the desert by the sea. As a sudden storm from the south, sweeping in from the desert, from a terrifying land,

(Isaiah 21:2) 
a difficult vision was announced to me. Who will tell it to everyone?

(Isaiah 21:3) 
The one who sees it is troubled. The one who hears it is stunned.

(Isaiah 21:4) 
My pain is turned into something terrifying: as if I am in labor and writhing. I am so worried that I can't hear clearly; I am so upset that I can't see clearly.

(Isaiah 21:5) 
My heart is troubled. Fear and trembling have come over me. The night that I longed for is now a nightmare.

(Isaiah 21:6) 
Set the table. Station the guards. Eat and drink! Prepare to stand up, and polish your shields.

(Isaiah 21:7) 
The Lord said to me, “Go, appoint a watchman. Let him announce whatever he sees.

(Isaiah 21:8) 
The watchman saw a chariot with two horses, and a rider on a donkey and a camel. He paid careful attention to what he saw, with a great deal of fear.

(Isaiah 21:9) 
Then the watchman, sounding the alarm, cried out: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower during the day, and I am standing on my guard all night.

(Isaiah 21:10) 
Behold, here comes a chariot with two horses! He gave the answer and said, “Babylon has fallen, and all of its carved idols are shattered on the ground.”

(Isaiah 21:11) 
This is a prophecy about the land of Edom. The people of Seir are calling to me: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”

(Isaiah 21:12) 
The watchman said: “Morning is coming, and also night. If you wish to know more, then come back again.”

(Isaiah 21:13) 
This is a prophecy about Arabia. Those who travel through the thickets of the forests in Arabia, you Dodanites, should prepare to rest.

(Isaiah 21:14) 
Bring water to the thirsty. You who live in the land of Tema, meet the fleeing people with food.

(Isaiah 21:15) 
For they have fled before the swords, before the drawn sword, before the stretched bow, and before the battle.

(Isaiah 21:16) 
For the Lord said to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count, all the glory of Kedar will be gone:

(Isaiah 21:17) 
and the remaining number of the strong archers of the sons of Kedar will be diminished.” This is the Lord God of Israel speaking.

(Isaiah 22:1) 
This prophecy concerns the valley of Jerusalem. Why have you gathered everyone and ascended to the roofs?

(Isaiah 22:2) 
Jerusalem is full of shouting. It is a city of exultation. Your slain are not slain by the sword, nor have they died in battle.

(Isaiah 22:3) 
Your leaders have all fled together. They were bound by archers, and all your captives were bound together.

(Isaiah 22:4) 
Therefore I said: “Turn away from me. Let me weep bitterly. Do not press me to console myself because of the desolation of the daughter of my people.”

(Isaiah 22:5) 
For the day of the Lord of hosts will be a day of tribulation, and of trampling, and of confusion in the valley of vision, to break down the wall, and to cry to the mountain.

(Isaiah 22:6) 
Elam took up the quiver with the chariot of the horseman; the shield uncovered its strength.

(Isaiah 22:7) 
Your choicest valleys will be full of chariots, and the horsemen will set themselves in array before the gate.

(Isaiah 22:8) 
Then the covering of Judah was revealed, and you looked to the armor of the house of the forest.

(Isaiah 22:9) 
You saw that the breaches in the city of David multiplied, and that you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

(Isaiah 22:10) 
You have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and have torn down houses to fortify the wall.

(Isaiah 22:11) 
You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water, but you did not look to him who made it, nor did you have any regard for him who formed it long ago.

(Isaiah 22:12) 
In that day, the Lord God of hosts summoned you to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.

(Isaiah 22:13) 
But instead, there is joy and gladness, slaughtering cattle and killing sheep, eating meat, and drinking wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.”

(Isaiah 22:14) 
Then the Lord of hosts revealed it in my ears: “Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord God of hosts.

(Isaiah 22:15) 
Thus says the Lord God of hosts: “Go, enter to this one who dwells in the temple, to Shebna, who is over the house.

(Isaiah 22:16) 
Say, “What do you have here? Or whom do you have here, that you have cut out a tomb for yourself here, cutting out a tomb on high, and carving a dwelling for yourself in the rock?”

(Isaiah 22:17) 
Behold, the Lord will hurl you away violently. He will toss you. He will wind you up.

(Isaiah 22:18) 
He will wrap you up and toss you like a ball, into a vast and spacious land. There you will die, and there will be the chariot of your glory, the shame of your master’s house.

(Isaiah 22:19) 
I will hurl you from your position, and I will cast you down from your office.

(Isaiah 22:20) 
And it shall be in that day: I will summon my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah,

(Isaiah 22:21) 
And I will clothe him with your tunic, and I will strengthen him with your belt, and I will give your authority into his hand. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

(Isaiah 22:22) 
And I will place the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.

(Isaiah 22:23) 
And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house.

(Isaiah 22:24) 
And they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the small vessels, from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of musical instruments.

(Isaiah 22:25) 
In that day, says the Lord of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will be removed, and it will break and fall, and the burden that was upon it will perish, for the Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 23:1) 
A prophecy about Tyre: Wail, all the ships on the sea, for the city of Tyre has been utterly destroyed. All the sailors will cry out once they come ashore.

(Isaiah 23:2) 
The sailors of Sidon, who come and go, will realize what happened to Tyre, and will cry out over what Tyre has lost.

(Isaiah 23:3) 
Tyre was a great merchant city, and the people of many nations relied on her for their food and goods, especially as she controlled the seas.

(Isaiah 23:4) 
The sea will be ashamed, saying, "I have not given birth, nor have I given any life to those who live in Tyre."

(Isaiah 23:5) 
When the news reaches Egypt, all the people will cry out with anguish over what has befallen Tyre.

(Isaiah 23:6) 
Go to Tarshish, and lament, you who live on the island of Tyre.

(Isaiah 23:7) 
Is this the city of joy, which has always been a place of traders and the hub of sea commerce?

(Isaiah 23:8) 
Who is responsible for the downfall of Tyre? Tyre, the city of merchants, whose merchants are princes, and whose traders are the most honored people in the world?

(Isaiah 23:9) 
The Lord of Hosts has decided to do this, to humble all the glory of Tyre, and bring shame to all the nobles on the earth.

(Isaiah 23:10) 
Go through your land like a river, daughter of Tarshish, and see what has happened to your wealth.

(Isaiah 23:11) 
The Lord has reached out His hand over the sea and shaken the kingdoms. He has given a command against the land of Canaan, that Tyre be utterly destroyed.

(Isaiah 23:12) 
And He said, "You will never again be joyful, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, go over to Cyprus. There you will find no rest." You will find no peace there.

(Isaiah 23:13) 
Look at the land of the Chaldeans, a nation that did not exist before the Assyrians founded it. They have captured the strongest soldiers of Tyre and destroyed its palaces. They have laid it waste.

(Isaiah 23:14) 
Wail, you ships of Tarshish, for your strength has been destroyed.

(Isaiah 23:15) 
In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the length of a king's reign. After seventy years, Tyre will be like a prostitute who sings and plays the harp to attract customers.

(Isaiah 23:16) 
After seventy years, the Lord will visit Tyre and restore its prosperity. Tyre will return to her trade and will be in demand with all the kingdoms of the world.

(Isaiah 23:17) 
Her profits and her wages will be dedicated to the Lord. They will not be stored up or hoarded, but will be used for the benefit of those who live before the Lord, so that they may have plenty to eat and good clothing.

(Isaiah 24:1) 
Behold, the Lord will make the earth a desolation, and will lay it waste; and will turn it upside down, and will scatter its inhabitants.

(Isaiah 24:2) 
And as with the people, so with the priest; and as with the servant, so with his master; as with the handmaid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

(Isaiah 24:3) 
The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.

(Isaiah 24:4) 
The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the lofty people of the earth languish.

(Isaiah 24:5) 
The earth is defiled under its inhabitants: because they have transgressed the laws, they have changed the ordinance, they have broken the everlasting covenant.

(Isaiah 24:6) 
Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein shall be desolate: therefore the inhabitants thereof shall be mad, and few men shall be left.

(Isaiah 24:7) 
The wine mourns, the vine languisheth, all the merry of heart sigh.

(Isaiah 24:8) 
The mirth of tabrets hath ceased, the noise of them that rejoice is ended, the joy of the harp is silent.

(Isaiah 24:9) 
They shall not drink wine with a song; the drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

(Isaiah 24:10) 
The city of vanity is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

(Isaiah 24:11) 
There shall be a cry in the streets because of wine; all joy is forsaken; the mirth of the land is gone away.

(Isaiah 24:12) 
In the city there is desolation, and the gate is broken with pieces.

(Isaiah 24:13) 
For it shall be thus in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the people: as if a few olives should remain, that have been shaken out of the olive tree: or grapes when the vintage is done.

(Isaiah 24:14) 
These shall lift up their voice, and give praise; in the islands of the sea they shall glorify the name of the Lord.

(Isaiah 24:15) 
Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the doctrine of fire, in the islands of the sea the name of the Lord God of Israel.

(Isaiah 24:16) 
From the ends of the earth we have heard praises, the glory of the just one. And I said: My secret to me, my secret to me. Woe is me! the prevaricators have prevaricated: and with the prevarication of transgressors they have prevaricated.

(Isaiah 24:17) 
Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the earth.

(Isaiah 24:18) 
And it shall come to pass, that he that shall flee from the noise of the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.

(Isaiah 24:19) 
The earth shall be shaken, it shall be greatly moved, it shall be broken asunder as a cup, and shall be moved to and fro like a tent: and the iniquity thereof shall be heavy upon it.

(Isaiah 24:20) 
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall visit upon the sword his hard, and great, and strong one, upon Leviathan the piercing serpent, and upon Leviathan the winding serpent: and shall slay the whale that is in the sea.

(Isaiah 24:21) 
In that day there shall be a vineyard of red wine: sing ye to it.

(Isaiah 24:22) 
I am the Lord that keep it; I will suddenly give it drink: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

(Isaiah 24:23) 
In that day there shall be a vineyard of wine: sing ye to it.

(Isaiah 25:1) 
Lord, You are my God; I will praise You, and I will give thanks to Your name because You do wonders, fulfilling ancient plans with faithfulness. Amen.

(Isaiah 25:2) 
For You have made the city into a heap of rubble, the fortified city.

(Isaiah 25:3) 
You have turned the city into ruins, and cast down its buildings never to be rebuilt.

(Isaiah 25:4) 
Therefore, a strong people will praise You; the city of the powerful nations will fear You.

(Isaiah 25:5) 
For You have become the refuge of the poor, the refuge of the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm, and a shade from the heat. The shadow of the powerful is like an impetuous storm.

(Isaiah 25:6) 
Like heat in a dry land, You will calm the tumult of the foreigners. Like heat in a dry land, You will humble the pride of the arrogant.

(Isaiah 25:7) 
And the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples on this mountain a feast of rich foods, a feast of purified wine, of rich marrow, of purified wine, well-strained.

(Isaiah 25:8) 
And He will destroy on this mountain the veil that covers all peoples, the woven garment that covers all nations.

(Isaiah 25:9) 
He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and He will take away the reproach of His people from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 25:10) 
In that day it will be said, “Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him; we will exult and rejoice in His salvation.”

(Isaiah 25:11) 
For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain; and Moab will be trampled under Him, as straw is trampled in a cart.

(Isaiah 25:12) 
And He will stretch out His hands over them, as the swimmer stretches out to swim; and He will bring low their pride with the trampling of their hands.

(Isaiah 25:13) 
He will bring down the high fortifications of your walls, humble them, and cast them down to the ground.

(Isaiah 26:1) 
In the land of Judah, our strong city is located. The Savior will be placed there. The Savior will be present within her.

(Isaiah 26:2) 
Open the gates! Let those enter who do what is right, who uphold the truth.

(Isaiah 26:3) 
The old error has passed away. You will preserve peace, because we put our hope in You.

(Isaiah 26:4) 
Lord, we put our hope in You along the path of Your judgment. The memory of Your name is our longing and desire.

(Isaiah 26:5) 
I desired You in my soul at night, and with my spirit within me, I will rise early in the morning to meet You.

(Isaiah 26:6) 
For when Your judgments come to the earth, those who live on Earth will learn justice.

(Isaiah 26:7) 
If the wicked are removed, they will not see the glory of the Lord. Shame will befall them, and the zeal of the people will consume them. Now, fire will consume the adversaries.

(Isaiah 26:8) 
Lord, You will grant us peace, for You have performed all our works for us.

(Isaiah 26:9) 
Lord our God, we have been dominated by lords other than You. But now we remember Your name only.

(Isaiah 26:10) 
They are dead, they shall not live: they shall fall, and shall not rise again. Therefore, You have visited and punished them, and have destroyed all memory of them from the earth.

(Isaiah 26:11) 
You have increased the nation, Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified. You have widened all the borders of the land.

(Isaiah 26:12) 
Lord, in tribulation they visited You. In times of distress, as in childbirth, I whispered a prayer.

(Isaiah 26:13) 
As a woman with child cries out in her labor pains, so we have become before You, Lord.

(Isaiah 26:14) 
We conceived, and it seemed we gave birth to wickedness, but we have produced a spirit of salvation.

(Isaiah 26:15) 
The dead will not live, nor will those who have fallen rise again. Therefore, You have visited and punished them, and have destroyed all memory of them.

(Isaiah 26:16) 
You have increased the nation, Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified. You have moved the borders of the earth.

(Isaiah 26:17) 
Lord, in tribulation they visited You, in times of distress they cried out as if in childbirth.

(Isaiah 26:18) 
As a woman in her pregnancy approaches childbirth and suffers, and cries out in her pain, so we are before You, Lord.

(Isaiah 26:19) 
Your dead will live, their bodies will rise. Awake, and sing, you who dwell in the dust, for Your dew is the dew of light, and You will crush the land of giants.

(Isaiah 26:20) 
Go, my people, enter your chambers, close your door behind you. Hide yourself a little while, until the wrath passes.

(Isaiah 26:21) 
For the Lord will come out of His place to punish the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth. The earth will reveal its blood, and it will no longer hide its dead.

(Isaiah 27:1) 
In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:

(Isaiah 27:2) 
Our strong city is Zion: God will place salvation in it like a wall and a rampart.

(Isaiah 27:3) 
Open the gates, that the just nation may enter, the one that keeps the truth.

(Isaiah 27:4) 
The old error has passed away: keep peace, peace: because we have hoped in You.

(Isaiah 27:5) 
You have hoped in the Lord throughout the ages, in the Lord, the strongest; therefore, He has destroyed the inhabitants of the high places, a lofty city.

(Isaiah 27:6) 
He will humble the high city, He will humble it to the ground, He will bring it down to the dust.

(Isaiah 27:7) 
The foot will tread it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.

(Isaiah 27:8) 
For Zion is eternal, and the poor will dwell in it.

(Isaiah 27:9) 
And there will be a direct path, and it will be called the holy way: the polluted will not pass through it, and this is the right way for you, so that you do not go astray.

(Isaiah 27:10) 
There will not be a lion there, and the harmful beast will not ascend it, nor will it be found there: but those who have been freed will walk.

(Isaiah 27:11) 
And those redeemed by the Lord will return, and will come to Zion with praise, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they will obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow will flee away.

(Isaiah 27:12) 
I, I am your comforter. Who are you, that you should be afraid of the face of mortal man, and of the son of man, who is like grass that is dried up?

(Isaiah 27:13) 
And have you forgotten the Lord your Maker, who stretched out the heavens, and founded the earth? And you have been in constant fear all day long because of the face of the fury of the oppressor: where is the fury of the oppressor?

(Isaiah 27:14) 
Quickly he will come, who cries out, and he will not die in the pit, nor will his bread fail.

(Isaiah 27:15) 
But I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea, and moves its waves: the Lord of hosts is My name.

(Isaiah 27:16) 
And I have put My words in your mouth, and I have protected you in the shadow of My hand: that I may plant the heavens, and found the earth, and say to Zion: You are My people.

(Isaiah 27:17) 
Arise, arise, stand up, Jerusalem, who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of wrath: you have drunk to the bottom of the cup of drunkenness, and you have drained it.

(Isaiah 27:18) 
There is none to guide her from all the sons she has brought forth: and there is none who will hold her hand from all the sons she has nourished.

(Isaiah 27:19) 
Two things have happened to you: who will grieve over you? Desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword; who will comfort you?

(Isaiah 27:20) 
Your sons have fainted, they have lain down at the head of all the ways like a buffalo in a snare, full of the indignation of the Lord, the wrath of your God.

(Isaiah 27:21) 
Therefore, hear these things, you poor thing, and you who are drunk, but not with wine.

(Isaiah 27:22) 
Thus says the Lord your Lord, and your God, who will fight for His people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of drunkenness, the cup of indignation: you will drink it no more.

(Isaiah 27:23) 
And I will put it in the hand of those who have humbled you, who have said to your soul: Bow down, that we may pass: and you have made your back as the ground, and as a way for those who pass by.

(Isaiah 28:1) 
Woe to the proud wreath of the drunkards of Ephraim, to the fading flower that is their glorious beauty, those who are on the top of the fertile valley, overcome by wine.

(Isaiah 28:2) 
Behold, the Lord is strong and mighty; he shall come as a storm of hail, a devastating whirlwind, like a torrent of many waters overflowing. He will cast them down to earth with a strong hand.

(Isaiah 28:3) 
The proud wreath of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trampled underfoot.

(Isaiah 28:4) 
And the fading flower of their glory, which is on the top of the fertile valley, will be like the first fruit before summer. Whoever sees it, immediately devours it while it is still in their hand.

(Isaiah 28:5) 
In that day, the Lord of Hosts will be a crown of glory and a crown of joy to the remnant of His people:

(Isaiah 28:6) 
And a spirit of judgment to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who return to battle.

(Isaiah 28:7) 
But even these err because of wine and stagger in drunkenness. The priest and the prophet have erred through wine, they are swallowed up by wine, they wander in drunkenness, they do not know the one who sees, they do not understand judgment.

(Isaiah 28:8) 
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no clean place.

(Isaiah 28:9) 
Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? To those just weaned, those removed from the breast?

(Isaiah 28:10) 
For it is: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, a little here, a little there.

(Isaiah 28:11) 
For with stammering lips and a foreign tongue, he will speak to this people.

(Isaiah 28:12) 
To whom he said: "This is my rest, take your rest." But they would not listen.

(Isaiah 28:13) 
So the word of the Lord will be to them: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, a little here, a little there; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

(Isaiah 28:14) 
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers, who are among this people in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 28:15) 
Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with hell we have made a pact: when the overflowing scourge passes through, it will not come upon us, because we have made lies our refuge, and we are protected by deceit."

(Isaiah 28:16) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lay in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a cornerstone, precious, founded on the foundation: he who believes will not be in haste.

(Isaiah 28:17) 
And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line; and the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hidden place.

(Isaiah 28:18) 
And your covenant with death will be annulled, and your pact with hell will not stand; when the overflowing scourge comes, you will be crushed by it.

(Isaiah 28:19) 
As often as it passes, it will take you away; for it will pass through every morning and through the day and through the night, and it will be terror, the mere hearing of the message.

(Isaiah 28:20) 
For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the covering is too narrow to wrap oneself in.

(Isaiah 28:21) 
For as the Lord will be enraged on Mount Perazim, so will he be moved in the valley of Gabaon, to do his work, his strange work, and to accomplish his task, his alien task.

(Isaiah 28:22) 
So now do not be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong, for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord God of Hosts, determined against the whole earth.

(Isaiah 28:23) 
Give ear and hear my voice; listen and hear my speech.

(Isaiah 28:24) 
Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and harrow his land all day?

(Isaiah 28:25) 
Does he not level its surface and then scatter the dill, the cumin, and then sow the wheat, barley, and spelt in its proper place?

(Isaiah 28:26) 
And God teaches him how to work, He instructs him.

(Isaiah 28:27) 
For the dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a flail, and the cumin with a rod.

(Isaiah 28:28) 
Bread is prepared by crushing it, but he will not always be threshing it; nor will he crush it with the wheel of a cart, nor break it with the hooves of his animals.

(Isaiah 28:29) 
This also comes from the Lord of Hosts: his wondrous counsel, and his great work.

(Isaiah 29:1) 
Woe to Jerusalem, Jerusalem, city where David dwelled! Let the years pass: turn your cycles, and I will gather Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 29:2) 
Jerusalem shall be in distress and I will bring sorrow to the city. Jerusalem will become a city of pain for me.

(Isaiah 29:3) 
I will besiege Jerusalem and surround it like a ball or a wheel.

(Isaiah 29:4) 
Jerusalem will be humbled and speak from the earth. Your voice will be heard as if it came from the dust. You will be like a python, and your whispers will be heard from the ground.

(Isaiah 29:5) 
Your many enemies will be like dust. Their great power will be quickly destroyed.

(Isaiah 29:6) 
The Lord of hosts will come and punish you with thunder, with earthquake, with loud noise, with storm, with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

(Isaiah 29:7) 
And the multitude of all the nations that fought against Jerusalem will be like a dream. All those who battled against and besieged Jerusalem will be like a dream.

(Isaiah 29:8) 
As a hungry man dreams he is eating, but when he wakes, his stomach is empty, or as a thirsty man dreams he is drinking, but when he wakes, he is exhausted and his soul is still thirsty, so it will be with the multitude of all the nations that warred against Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 29:9) 
Be astonished, and wonder, and be delighted, and cry out. Be drunk, but not with wine, and stagger, but not with strong drink.

(Isaiah 29:10) 
God has poured out a spirit of deep sleep on you, and closed your eyes. He has covered the eyes of your prophets and seers.

(Isaiah 29:11) 
Every vision will be like the words of a sealed book. If you give the book to someone who can read, and you say, "Read this", he will reply, "I cannot; it is sealed."

(Isaiah 29:12) 
If the book is given to someone who cannot read and you say, "Read this," he will reply, "I do not know how to read."

(Isaiah 29:13) 
The Lord has said, "Because this people approaches me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

(Isaiah 29:14) 
Therefore, I will confound this people with new and wondrous actions, and I will take away the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent.

(Isaiah 29:15) 
Woe to those who are deep in heart, and hide their counsel from the Lord, and whose works are in the dark, who say: "Who sees us? And who knows us?"

(Isaiah 29:16) 
Your thinking is perverse, like the clay of the potter. Will the thing made say to the maker, "He did not make me?" Or will a work say to the craftsman, "He does not understand?"

(Isaiah 29:17) 
In a little while, will Lebanon not be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted as a forest?

(Isaiah 29:18) 
In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see after darkness and obscurity.

(Isaiah 29:19) 
The meek will increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 29:20) 
For the mighty will be brought to nothing, the oppressor will be finished, and all those who watched for iniquity will be cut off.

(Isaiah 29:21) 
They cause men to sin in the word, and supplant those who rebuke in the gate, and they turn aside from the just.

(Isaiah 29:22) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham, "Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will his face now be sad.

(Isaiah 29:23) 
But when he sees his children, the works of my hands in their midst, sanctifying my name, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will fear the God of Israel.

(Isaiah 29:24) 
And those who err in spirit will know understanding, and the murmurers will learn the law.

(Isaiah 30:1) 
Woe to the sons of the desert, says the Lord, who begin plans that are not from Me, and weave a fabric of deception, not by My Spirit, so that they pile sin upon sin.

(Isaiah 30:2) 
They travel to go down to Egypt, and have not asked My counsel, trusting in the shadow of Pharaoh, seeking protection in the shelter of Egypt.

(Isaiah 30:3) 
The strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the confidence you have in the shadow of Egypt will be to your disgrace.

(Isaiah 30:4) 
For the leaders of Egypt were at Tanis, and its envoys came to Hanes.

(Isaiah 30:5) 
All will be ashamed because of the people, who will not profit them: they will be of no help, nor of any use, but will bring shame and disgrace.

(Isaiah 30:6) 
The burden of the beasts of the south: in the land of tribulation and anguish, the lion, the lioness, the viper, and the flying serpent: they carry on the shoulders of asses their riches, and on the humps of camels their treasures, to a people who will not profit them.

(Isaiah 30:7) 
Egypt will vainly help and give nothing: therefore I have cried out to Egypt, "Be still."

(Isaiah 30:8) 
Now go, write this in a book, and record it on a tablet, so that it may be for the last day, as a testimony forever.

(Isaiah 30:9) 
For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to hear the law of God.

(Isaiah 30:10) 
They say to the seers: “Do not see visions,” and to those who have visions, “Do not look at things that are right; speak to us smooth things, see for us delusions.”

(Isaiah 30:11) 
Turn aside from the way, turn aside from the path, remove the Holy One of Israel from our sight.

(Isaiah 30:12) 
Therefore, the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you despise this word, and trust in deceit and rebellion, and rely on it:

(Isaiah 30:13) 
This iniquity will be for you like a breach, falling and bulging in a wall, which will suddenly come at an unexpected time.

(Isaiah 30:14) 
It will break like a potter's vessel, and be shattered, so that there will not be found among its fragments a piece with which to carry fire from the hearth, or to draw water from the cisterns.

(Isaiah 30:15) 
For the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, says this: “In repentance and silence is your strength, and in hope and in justice will be your power.” But you would not.

(Isaiah 30:16) 
And you said, “No, we will flee on horses.” Therefore you shall flee. “We will ride on swift horses.” Therefore those who pursue you will be swift.

(Isaiah 30:17) 
A thousand men will flee at the sight of one, and at the sight of five you will flee, until you are left like a pole on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.

(Isaiah 30:18) 
And therefore the Lord waits to have mercy on you: and therefore He will be exalted, sparing you: for the Lord is a God of judgment, and blessed are all who wait for Him.

(Isaiah 30:19) 
For a people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: You will weep, and at the sound of your cry, as soon as He hears you, He will answer you.

(Isaiah 30:20) 
And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction: your teacher will not be removed from you, and your eyes will see your teacher.

(Isaiah 30:21) 
And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” neither turning to the right nor the left.

(Isaiah 30:22) 
And you will defile the plates of your carved silver, and the garment of your molten gold, and you will scatter them as an unclean thing: “Get out,” you will say to it.

(Isaiah 30:23) 
And rain will be given to your seed, wherever you sow it in the land: and the bread from the produce of the earth will be most abundant and rich: in that day your livestock will graze in wide pastures.

(Isaiah 30:24) 
And the bulls and the asses that plow the land will eat fodder seasoned with flavor, which has been winnowed in the threshing floor.

(Isaiah 30:25) 
And on every high mountain, and on every elevated hill, there will be streams of flowing water, on the day when many are slain, when the towers fall.

(Isaiah 30:26) 
And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when the Lord binds up the wound of His people and heals the pain of their wound.

(Isaiah 30:27) 
Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar, His burning anger, and heavy to bear: His lips are filled with indignation, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.

(Isaiah 30:28) 
His Spirit is like an overflowing torrent up to the neck: to destroy the nations in vanity, and with the bridle of error that is in the jaws of the peoples.

(Isaiah 30:29) 
Your song will be like the night of a consecrated festival, and the joy of the heart, like one who goes to hear, on the mountain of the Lord, to the strong one of Israel.

(Isaiah 30:30) 
And the Lord will make His glorious voice heard, and will make them hear the strength of His arm, with the indignation of His fury, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a tempestuous attack.

(Isaiah 30:31) 
For at the voice of the Lord, Assyria will be troubled, and it will be struck with the rod.

(Isaiah 30:32) 
And there will be a firm foundation for the rod that the Lord will make to rest upon him, with timbrels and harps, and He will fight against them in battles.

(Isaiah 30:33) 
For Tophet is prepared of old, and it also is prepared for the king: deep and wide: with fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord will burn it like a torrent of sulfur.

(Isaiah 31:1) 
Woe to those who turn to Egypt for help, trusting in horses and chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are strong; but they have not put their trust in the Holy One of Israel, nor sought the Lord.

(Isaiah 31:2) 
But He Who is wise brought evil, and did not withdraw His word; He will arise against the house of the wicked, and against those who help do evil.

(Isaiah 31:3) 
Egypt is a man, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When He stretches out His hand, the helper will fall, and he whom he helps will fall, and they will all perish together.

(Isaiah 31:4) 
For thus says the Lord to me: "As the lion roars and the young lion over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds are called against him, he is not afraid at their voice or disturbed at their clamor, so the Lord of hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill."

(Isaiah 31:5) 
Like birds hovering, so the Lord of hosts will protect Jerusalem; protecting and delivering, passing over and saving.

(Isaiah 31:6) 
Return to Him from whom the children of Israel have deeply departed.

(Isaiah 31:7) 
For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you.

(Isaiah 31:8) 
Then the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the face of the sword, and his chosen men shall pay tribute.

(Isaiah 31:9) 
And his strength shall pass away with fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the standard, says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 32:1) 
Look! A king will rule with perfect justice, and his leaders will govern with righteous judgment.

(Isaiah 32:2) 
And this man, the king, will be like a refuge from the wind, a cover from the scorching heat. He will be like rushing streams of water in a parched land, and the shade of a massive rock in a desolate desert.

(Isaiah 32:3) 
The eyes of those who truly see will no longer be dim, and the ears of those who truly hear will listen with greater attention.

(Isaiah 32:4) 
The minds of the foolish will then understand knowledge, and the tongues of those who stammer will speak quickly and clearly.

(Isaiah 32:5) 
The foolish person will no longer be called a leader, nor will the deceitful be called a great man.

(Isaiah 32:6) 
For the foolish person speaks foolish things, and his heart plots evil. He practices hypocrisy and speaks lies against the Lord. He leaves the hungry soul empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.

(Isaiah 32:7) 
The deceitful also use wicked schemes. He devises evil plans to destroy the humble with lying words, even when the poor man speaks what is right.

(Isaiah 32:8) 
But the noble man plans noble things, and he will stand firm in noble leadership.

(Isaiah 32:9) 
Rise up, you complacent women, and listen to my voice! You overconfident daughters, pay close attention to my words!

(Isaiah 32:10) 
In just a little more than a year, you confident women will be troubled, for the grape harvest will fail completely; no produce will be gathered.

(Isaiah 32:11) 
Tremble, you confident women! Be troubled, you carefree ones! Strip off your fine clothing and expose your bare skin. Gird sackcloth around your waists in mourning.

(Isaiah 32:12) 
Beat your breasts in lamentation for the lovely fields, for the fruitful vine, and for all that was desirable.

(Isaiah 32:13) 
For upon the land of my people, thorns and thistles will grow, covering all the houses of joy in the once jubilant city.

(Isaiah 32:14) 
Indeed, the palace is abandoned, the bustling city is deserted. Gloom and darkness have settled in the desolate caves and ruins for a long time. It will become a place of delight for wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks.

(Isaiah 32:15) 
This will continue until the Spirit from on high is poured out upon us. Then the wilderness will become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered a forest.

(Isaiah 32:16) 
And justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will reside in the fruitful field.

(Isaiah 32:17) 
And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quiet confidence and lasting security forever.

(Isaiah 32:18) 
Then my people will dwell in peaceful dwellings, in secure habitations, and in tranquil places of abundant rest.

(Isaiah 32:19) 
But hail will bring down the forest, and the city that caused humiliation will be utterly brought low.

(Isaiah 32:20) 
Blessed are you who sow seeds by all waters, letting the ox and the donkey freely tread the ground.

(Isaiah 33:1) 
Woe to you who plunders others, yet you yourself are not plundered by anyone in return. But when you finish your devastation, you yourself will be devastated in turn! Will you not, when you cease to despise others, then be despised yourself?

(Isaiah 33:2) 
O Lord, have mercy on us; for we have waited and hoped in You. Be our strength and the might of our arm every morning, and be our salvation in our time of tribulation and great distress.

(Isaiah 33:3) 
At the sound of God’s powerful messenger, the nations that oppress His people will flee in terror. From Your rising up in power, the Gentile nations will be scattered.

(Isaiah 33:4) 
And your plunder, O oppressor, will be gathered up by your victims just like a swarm of locusts gathers over a field. Just as locusts gather, so will your spoils be gathered from you.

(Isaiah 33:5) 
Great is the Lord, because He dwells on high, in the heavens above the universe. He has filled Sion (the City of God) with justice and righteousness.

(Isaiah 33:6) 
And there will be faithfulness and stability in your times. The riches of your salvation will be wisdom and true knowledge. The reverence and awe of the Lord Himself is the treasure that God gives to His people.

(Isaiah 33:7) 
Behold, the watchmen who look out from the public squares will weep in sorrow. The messengers of peace, who went to negotiate with the oppressors, will weep bitterly.

(Isaiah 33:8) 
The roads are desolate and deserted; the passage of travelers has ceased. The treaties and covenants made with the oppressor have been made void. He has rejected and destroyed cities, and he has shown no regard for human life.

(Isaiah 33:9) 
The land itself mourns and wastes away in sorrow. Lebanon is put to shame and its forests have withered. The fertile Plain of Sharon has become like a desert, and the rich regions of Bashan and Carmel are devastated.

(Isaiah 33:10) 
Now I will arise, says the Lord. Now I will be exalted in power. Now I will be lifted up and glorified.

(Isaiah 33:11) 
You, the oppressors, will conceive only trouble and bring forth only stubble and chaff. Your own spirit, your own rage and wickedness, will consume you like a devouring fire.

(Isaiah 33:12) 
And the peoples who oppose Me will be like burned lime, reduced to ashes. Like thorns that have been trampled, they will be completely burned up by fire.

(Isaiah 33:13) 
Hear, you who are near to Me, what I have done. And you who are far off, acknowledge My strength and My power.

(Isaiah 33:14) 
The sinners in Sion are terrified. Trembling has seized the hypocrites and the godless. Who among you, then, will be able to dwell with a devouring fire, which is the righteous judgment of God? Who among you will be able to dwell with everlasting burnings?

(Isaiah 33:15) 
It is he who walks in true righteousness and speaks the truth, rejecting dishonest gain from his hand and shaking his hand to refuse every bribe. He stops his ears from listening to talk of bloodshed and closes his eyes from looking upon evil.

(Isaiah 33:16) 
Such a person will dwell securely on high, in elevated places. The fortresses of rocks will be his refuge and his stronghold. He is given his daily bread, and his water supply is sure and constant.

(Isaiah 33:17) 
His eyes will see the King, God Himself, in His splendor and majesty. They will also see the promised land stretching out far away into the distance.

(Isaiah 33:18) 
Your heart will recall the terror and distress of the past. Then you will ask: 'Where is the scribe who recorded the tribute? Where is he who weighed the tax money? Where is the mighty oppressor who counted the towers for siege?'

(Isaiah 33:19) 
You will no longer see the insolent and arrogant people who invaded your land. You will not see the people whose language was so deep and foreign that you could not understand their speech; nor will you hear their arrogant tongue, which you could not comprehend.

(Isaiah 33:20) 
Look upon Sion, the city of our solemn feasts and holy gatherings! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful and prosperous dwelling place. It will be like a tent that will never be taken down; its tent pegs will never be removed for all time, and none of its ropes will ever break.

(Isaiah 33:21) 
For there, in Jerusalem, our Lord will be glorious and powerful. He will be to us like mighty rivers, broad and wide-flowing streams, providing impenetrable defense. No warship rowed by enemies will pass through it, nor will any great ship of war sail upon it.

(Isaiah 33:22) 
For the Lord is our Judge. The Lord is our Lawgiver. The Lord is our King. He Himself will save us.

(Isaiah 33:23) 
The ropes of your enemy's 'ship' (their military strength and siege equipment) are slackened and loose; they will not hold firm. Their mast is so weakened that it cannot stand upright, and their sails cannot hold any wind to move their ships (your captured cities). Then, the plunder of many nations will be divided. Even the lame and weak will seize the spoil and share in the plunder.

(Isaiah 33:24) 
And no resident in the land will say: 'I am sick' or 'I am weak.' The people who dwell in it will have their iniquity, their sins, taken away from them and forgiven.

(Isaiah 34:1) 
Approach, all you nations, and listen carefully.
All you peoples, pay attention.
Let the entire earth hear this, with all its inhabitants.
Let the whole world and everyone living on it understand.

(Isaiah 34:2) 
Because the Lord's strong anger is against all the nations,
and His fury is upon all their armies.
He will destroy them completely,
and hand them over to be slaughtered.

(Isaiah 34:3) 
Their dead bodies will be thrown out unburied.
A terrible stench will rise from their corpses.
The mountains will be soaked and appear to melt away from the vast amount of their blood.

(Isaiah 34:4) 
Then all the stars in the universe will dissolve,
and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll.
All the celestial bodies, like an army, will fall
just as leaves fall from a vine or from a fig tree.

(Isaiah 34:5) 
For My sword has been readied and made to strike in the spiritual realm of God.
Now, behold, it descends upon Edom,
and upon the people whom I have destined for utter destruction.

(Isaiah 34:6) 
The Lord's sword is completely drenched with blood;
it is heavy with fat,
from the blood of symbolic lambs and goats,
from the fat of symbolic rams and bulls.
For the Lord is offering a sacrifice of judgment in Bozrah,
and there will be a great slaughter throughout the land of Edom.

(Isaiah 34:7) 
And the wild oxen, with their great strength, will be brought down with them,
and the mighty bulls along with the wild cattle.
Their land will be drenched and made to drink their blood,
and their soil will be enriched with the fat of their powerful people, set apart for destruction.

(Isaiah 34:8) 
For this is the day of the Lord's vengeance,
the year of recompense, to bring justice for Zion.

(Isaiah 34:9) 
Then Edom's streams will be turned into burning tar,
and its soil into brimstone.
Its entire land will become a blazing inferno of tar.

(Isaiah 34:10) 
It will not be extinguished day or night;
its smoke will rise up forever.
From one generation to the next, it will remain a desolate wasteland.
No one will ever pass through it again, for all eternity.

(Isaiah 34:11) 
The pelican and the hedgehog will possess it.
The owl and the raven will make their home there.
God will stretch over it the measuring line of emptiness,
and the plummet of annihilation, ensuring its complete destruction.

(Isaiah 34:12) 
Her nobles will no longer be found there.
Indeed, there will be no one left to be her kings or princes either.

(Isaiah 34:13) 
Thorns will grow in her palaces,
and nettles and brambles in her fortresses.
It will become a lair for jackals,
and a dwelling place for ostriches.

(Isaiah 34:14) 
Wild demons will meet with howling hyenas;
and the hairy satyrs will cry out to one another.
There, the night hag will come to rest,
and find her own place of quiet.

(Isaiah 34:15) 
There the screech owl will make her nest, lay her eggs, hatch them,
and gather her young under her wings.
Indeed, kites will also gather there, one calling to another.

(Isaiah 34:16) 
Search diligently in the book of the Lord and read this carefully.
Not one of these prophecies will fail,
nor will any of these creatures be missing their mate or their place.
For the mouth of the Lord has commanded it,
and His very Spirit has gathered them together.

(Isaiah 34:17) 
God Himself has cast lots to determine their portion,
and His hand has measured out their inheritance for them.
They will possess that land forever,
and from generation to generation, they will dwell in it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:1) 
The deserted and pathless regions will rejoice. The solitary wilderness will be glad and will blossom like a lily, bursting forth in life.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:2) 
It will burst forth with abundant growth and will rejoice with overflowing gladness and praise. The splendor of Lebanon will be given to it, and the beauty of Carmel and Sharon. All the people there will see the glory of the Lord and the magnificent beauty of our God.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:3) 
Strengthen the feeble hands and make firm the weak knees.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:4) 
Say to those who are fainthearted: "Be strong, and do not be afraid! Behold, your God will come with divine justice and a just retribution. God Himself will come to rescue and save you."

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:5) 
Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened, and the ears of those who are deaf will be unstopped.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:6) 
Then the lame will leap like a stag, and the tongue of those who cannot speak will be made clear. For waters will burst forth in the deserted regions, and streams of water will flow in the solitary wilderness.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:7) 
The dry ground will be transformed into ponds, and the thirsty land into flowing springs of water. In the dens where wild beasts once lived, there will arise verdant reeds and rushes, turning their desolate homes into a lush swamp.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:8) 
And there will be a designated path and a true road there, and it will be called "the Holy Way." No unclean person will pass through it. This will be a straightforward path for you, so clear that even foolish people will not go astray on it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:9) 
No lion will be there, and no savage beast will go up on it or be found there. Only those who have been set free will walk upon it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:10) 
And the Lord's redeemed people will return. They will come to Zion—the holy city of Jerusalem, their spiritual home—with praise, and with everlasting joy upon their heads. They will possess joy and gladness, and all sorrow and sighing will flee far away.

(Isaiah 36:1) 
It happened in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign: Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

(Isaiah 36:2) 
From Lachish, the Assyrian king sent Rabshakeh with a large army to Jerusalem, to confront King Hezekiah. Rabshakeh took his position by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road that leads to the Fuller's Field.

(Isaiah 36:3) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah and the steward of the king's household, along with Shebna the royal scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph and the recorder, went out to meet him.

(Isaiah 36:4) 
Rabshakeh spoke to them, saying: 'Tell Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What is this confidence you rely on? What gives you this certainty?'

(Isaiah 36:5) 
'Do you think you have a strategy and strength sufficient for battle? So, tell me, on whom are you relying now, since you have openly rebelled against me?'

(Isaiah 36:6) 
'Look, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed staff. If a man leans on it, it will pierce his hand and wound it deeply. That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is to all who trust in him.'

(Isaiah 36:7) 
'But if you tell me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is He not the very One whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, when he commanded Judah and Jerusalem: "You shall worship before this altar only"?'

(Isaiah 36:8) 
'Now, make a pledge to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you can even find enough riders among yourselves for them.'

(Isaiah 36:9) 
'How then can you resist even one of the least of my master's officials? Yet you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen.'

(Isaiah 36:10) 
'Furthermore, have I come up against this land to destroy it without the Lord's approval? The Lord Himself said to me: "Go up against this land and destroy it."'

(Isaiah 36:11) 
Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh: 'Please, speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah, where all the people listening on the wall can hear you.'

(Isaiah 36:12) 
But Rabshakeh replied: 'Did my master send me to speak all these words only to your master and to you? No, he sent me precisely to the men sitting on the wall, so that they will understand that soon they will be forced to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with you, from the extreme hunger and thirst of the siege.'

(Isaiah 36:13) 
So Rabshakeh stood up and shouted with a loud voice in the language of Judah, saying: 'Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!'

(Isaiah 36:14) 
'Thus says the king: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will surely not be able to rescue you.'

(Isaiah 36:15) 
'Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, by saying: "The Lord will surely deliver us! This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."'

(Isaiah 36:16) 
'Do not listen to Hezekiah! For thus says the king of Assyria: Make a treaty with me and come out to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern.'

(Isaiah 36:17) 
'Until I come and take you away to a land just like your own land—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.'

(Isaiah 36:18) 
'Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us." Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?'

(Isaiah 36:19) 
'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?'

(Isaiah 36:20) 
'Which among all the gods of these lands have ever delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord should be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'

(Isaiah 36:21) 
But they remained silent and did not answer him a single word, because the king had given a command: 'Do not answer him.'

(Isaiah 36:22) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah and the steward of the king's household, along with Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph and the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in mourning, and they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.

(Isaiah 37:1) 
When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and wrapped himself in sackcloth, then he went into the Temple of the Lord.

(Isaiah 37:2) 
Hezekiah sent Eliacim, who was the steward of the royal palace, and Sobna the scribe, along with the elders of the priests. All of them were covered in sackcloth, and they went to Isaiah, the prophet and son of Amos.

(Isaiah 37:3) 
They said to him: "This is what King Hezekiah says: 'This day is full of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy. It is as if a child has come to the moment of birth, but there is no strength left for the mother to deliver it'—a metaphor for our complete helplessness.'

(Isaiah 37:4) 
"Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, sent to insult the living God and to scorn Him with the words that the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, please offer a prayer for the remnant of us who are still here and remain in Jerusalem."

(Isaiah 37:5) 
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

(Isaiah 37:6) 
And Isaiah said to them: "You shall say this to your master, King Hezekiah: 'This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard—the words with which the young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed and scorned me.'"

(Isaiah 37:7) 
"Behold, I will put a different spirit upon him, and he will hear a rumor, and he will return to his own land. And I will cause him to be struck down by a sword in his own land."

(Isaiah 37:8) 
So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had departed from Lachish.

(Isaiah 37:9) 
Then Sennacherib heard concerning Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, that he was coming out to fight against him. So when he heard this news, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah, saying:

(Isaiah 37:10) 
"You shall say this to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: 'Do not let your God, in whom you place your trust, deceive you by saying: Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'"

(Isaiah 37:11) 
"Behold, you yourself have heard all that the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, and how they utterly destroyed them. Do you truly think you will be able to escape and be delivered?"

(Isaiah 37:12) 
"Did the false gods of the nations, whom my fathers destroyed, deliver them—nations such as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?"

(Isaiah 37:13) 
"Where is the king of Hamath now, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivah?"

(Isaiah 37:14) 
And Hezekiah received the letters from the hands of the messengers and read them. Then he went up into the Temple of the Lord and spread the letters out before the Lord.

(Isaiah 37:15) 
And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:

(Isaiah 37:16) 
"O Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, You who sit enthroned above the Cherubim, You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You are the one who created the universe and the earth itself."

(Isaiah 37:17) 
"Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear. Open Your eyes, O Lord, and see. Hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to blaspheme the living God."

(Isaiah 37:18) 
"It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have laid waste the lands and their territories."

(Isaiah 37:19) 
"And they threw the gods of those nations into the fire, because they were not true gods, but merely the work of human hands—objects of wood and stone. And so the Assyrians utterly destroyed them."

(Isaiah 37:20) 
"And now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are the Lord."

(Isaiah 37:21) 
Then Isaiah, the son of Amos, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib, the king of Assyria—'"

(Isaiah 37:22) 
"These are the words that the Lord has spoken about him: 'The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you as you depart.'"

(Isaiah 37:23) 
"Whom have you scorned and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, and lifted your eyes arrogantly on high? It was against the Holy One of Israel."

(Isaiah 37:24) 
"By the hand of your servants, you have insulted the Lord, and you have said: 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended to the highest peaks of the mountains, to the very top of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest fir trees. I will reach its highest summit, even its densest forest of Carmel.'"

(Isaiah 37:25) 
"I myself have dug wells and drunk water. And with the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the rivers meant to protect the besieged cities."

(Isaiah 37:26) 
"Have you not heard that I—the Lord—ordained this long ago? From ancient days I formed this plan. Now I have brought it to pass, and you have become the instrument for laying waste fortified cities and their defensive mounds."

(Isaiah 37:27) 
"And the inhabitants of those lands were weakened, dismayed, and utterly confounded. They became like the grass of the field, or the plants of the pasture, or the vegetation on the housetops that withers away before it can even mature."

(Isaiah 37:28) 
"I know your resting place, your going out, your coming in, and the path you take, and your furious rage against me."

(Isaiah 37:29) 
"Because you have raged violently against me, and your arrogance has risen to reach my ears, I will put a hook in your nose and a bridle in your mouth, and I will lead you back by the very way you came."

(Isaiah 37:30) 
"And this will be a sign for you, O Hezekiah: This year, you shall eat what grows of itself. In the second year, you shall eat what grows from the first year's harvest. But in the third year, you shall sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."

(Isaiah 37:31) 
"And the remnant that has escaped from the house of Judah, that which remains, shall again take deep root below and bear fruit above."

(Isaiah 37:32) 
"For out of Jerusalem will come forth a remnant, and from Mount Zion will come those who are saved. The fervent zeal of the Lord of Armies will accomplish this."

(Isaiah 37:33) 
"Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor approach it with a shield, nor build a siege ramp against it."

(Isaiah 37:34) 
"By the very road on which he came, he will return. He shall not enter this city, declares the Lord."

(Isaiah 37:35) 
"And I will protect this city and deliver it, for my own sake and for the sake of David, my faithful servant."

(Isaiah 37:36) 
Then the Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead bodies.

(Isaiah 37:37) 
So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, departed and went away. He returned home and settled in Nineveh.

(Isaiah 37:38) 
While he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his pagan god, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with a sword. Then they fled into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place as king.

(Isaiah 38:1) 
In those days, King Hezekiah became very sick, so sick that he was going to die. Isaiah, the son of Amos, who was a prophet of God, came to him and said, "This is what the Lord God says: 'Put your affairs in order—prepare your household for your death—for you will surely die and not live.'"

(Isaiah 38:2) 
When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face toward the wall and began to pray to the Lord God.

(Isaiah 38:3) 
And Hezekiah prayed, saying, "Oh Lord, I beg you, please remember how I have lived before you—I have always walked honestly and with a complete heart, and I have done what you found pleasing." Then Hezekiah wept with great sorrow.

(Isaiah 38:4) 
Then the word of the Lord God came to Isaiah, saying:

(Isaiah 38:5) 
"Go and tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the Lord God, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Now, behold, I will add fifteen more years to your life.

(Isaiah 38:6) 
And I will rescue you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria, and I will protect this city.'"

(Isaiah 38:7) 
And this will be your sign from the Lord God, that the Lord God will indeed do this thing that He has spoken.

(Isaiah 38:8) 
"Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps of Ahaz's sundial—the steps by which it had already descended—to go back ten steps." And the sun's shadow on the sundial did indeed go back ten steps from where it had descended, demonstrating God's power over time.

(Isaiah 38:9) 
This is a written prayer and record by King Hezekiah of Judah, composed after he had been sick and then had recovered from his illness.

(Isaiah 38:10) 
I had said to myself, "In the middle of my life, I will go down to the gates of the grave—the realm of the dead. I thought I would be deprived of the rest of my years."

(Isaiah 38:11) 
I said, "I will no longer see the Lord God in the land of the living. I will not look upon another human being, nor dwell among those who live in the world anymore."

(Isaiah 38:12) 
My generation has been taken away, and my life has been folded up from me like a shepherd's tent. My life has been cut off like a weaver's thread from the loom; while I was still weaving it, He cut me off. From the morning until the evening, you will bring my life to an end.

(Isaiah 38:13) 
I waited patiently until morning, but like a lion, God crushed all my bones. From the morning until the evening, you will bring my life to an end.

(Isaiah 38:14) 
I chirped like a young swallow, and I mourned like a dove. My eyes grew dim from looking upward, constantly begging for help. Lord, I am suffering great violence and oppression—please answer for me.

(Isaiah 38:15) 
What can I say? What will He answer me when He Himself has done this—permitted this to happen? I will remember all my past years in the bitterness of my soul.

(Isaiah 38:16) 
O Lord, if this is how life is lived by men, and if my spirit's life finds its perfection and purpose in such experiences, then you have healed me and given me life again.

(Isaiah 38:17) 
Behold, in my peace—in my supposed rest—my bitterness was most bitter. But you, O Lord, have rescued my soul so that it would not perish; you have cast all my sins behind your back, completely removing them from your sight.

(Isaiah 38:18) 
For the realm of the dead will not give thanks to you, nor will death praise you. Those who descend into the pit—into the grave—will not hope for your truth.

(Isaiah 38:19) 
The living, yes, the living, will give thanks to you, just as I do today. A father will make your truth known to his children.

(Isaiah 38:20) 
O Lord, save me! And we will sing our psalms all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord God.

(Isaiah 38:21) 
And Isaiah said, "Bring a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, and he will recover."

(Isaiah 38:22) 
Then Hezekiah asked, "What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord God again?"

(Isaiah 39:39:1) 
In that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, who was the king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to King Hezekiah. This was because he had heard that Hezekiah had become ill and then recovered.

(Isaiah 39:39:2) 
King Hezekiah was greatly pleased by their visit and gifts, and he showed them everything in his royal treasury. He revealed his silver, his gold, all his spices, the finest oils, and all the furnishings within his palace. Hezekiah held nothing back from them from his treasures or from all that was under his authority.

(Isaiah 39:39:3) 
After this, the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him: 'What did those men say to you? And where did they come from to reach you?' Hezekiah responded: 'They came to me from a very distant land, from Babylon.'

(Isaiah 39:39:4) 
Isaiah then asked: 'What did they see in your royal palace?' Hezekiah replied: 'They saw everything that is in my house; there was nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.'

(Isaiah 39:39:5) 
Then Isaiah spoke to Hezekiah: 'Listen closely to the message from the Lord of armies.'

(Isaiah 39:39:6) 
Indeed, the days are coming when everything in your royal palace, and all the riches your ancestors have accumulated until this very day, will be taken away to Babylon. Nothing will be left behind, declares the Lord God.

(Isaiah 39:39:7) 
And some of your own sons, those who will be born to you and descend from you, will be taken away. They will be made eunuchs and forced to serve in the palace of the king of Babylon.

(Isaiah 39:39:8) 
Hezekiah responded to Isaiah: 'The message from the Lord God that you have spoken is good.' He then added: 'At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime.'

(Isaiah 40:1) 
“Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God, calling them to be consoled.

(Isaiah 40:2) 
Speak directly and tenderly to Jerusalem; tell her that her time of suffering has been completed. Her iniquity has been forgiven, for she has received from the Lord’s hand a double portion of recompense for all her sins.

(Isaiah 40:3) 
There is a voice of one calling out in the wilderness, saying: “Prepare the road for the Lord! Make the pathways of our God straight in the barren lands!”

(Isaiah 40:4) 
Every low valley will be elevated, and every mountain and hill will be made low. The twisted roads will become straight, and the rough, uneven ground will become smooth pathways.

(Isaiah 40:5) 
And then the radiant glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all humanity will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord God has spoken this truth.

(Isaiah 40:6) 
A voice then commanded: “Cry out!” And I answered: “What message should I proclaim?” The voice responded: “All human beings are as fleeting as grass, and all their earthly splendor is like a fragile wildflower.”

(Isaiah 40:7) 
The grass dries up, and the flower fades away, because the breath of the Lord (like a strong wind) blows over it. Indeed, human beings are as transient as grass.

(Isaiah 40:8) 
The grass dries up, and the flower fades away, but the word and eternal decree of our God remains for all eternity.

(Isaiah 40:9) 
Go up onto a high mountain, you who bring the good news of salvation to Sion! Raise your voice with all your strength, you who proclaim the good news to Jerusalem! Raise it up without fear! Say to the cities of Judah: “Behold, here is your God!”

(Isaiah 40:10) 
Behold, the Lord God will come with overwhelming power, and His mighty arm will have dominion. Behold, His eternal reward is with Him, and His works of salvation are before His face.

(Isaiah 40:11) 
Like a shepherd, He will feed His flock. He will gather the young lambs with His arm and carry them close to His chest, and He Himself will gently lead the ewes that are pregnant or nursing.

(Isaiah 40:12) 
Who has ever measured the waters of the deep in the hollow of His hand, or weighed the entire universe with His palm? Who has measured the mass of the earth with just three fingers, or balanced the mountains on scales and the hills in a balance?

(Isaiah 40:13) 
Who has ever guided the Spirit of the Lord, or who has served as His advisor and taught Him how to act?

(Isaiah 40:14) 
From whom did He receive advice, and who instructed Him, teaching Him the path of righteousness? Who imparted knowledge to Him, and showed Him the way of true understanding?

(Isaiah 40:15) 
Behold, all the nations of the world are like a single drop falling from a bucket, and they are regarded as nothing more than the fine dust that barely registers on a balance scale. Behold, even the great islands are like tiny specks of dust.

(Isaiah 40:16) 
Even the vast forests of Lebanon would not provide enough wood for a fire offering, and its multitude of animals would not be sufficient for a single burnt sacrifice worthy of God.

(Isaiah 40:17) 
All the nations, in His sight, are as if they do not exist. They are accounted as nothing, utterly empty and void of substance.

(Isaiah 40:18) 
To whom, then, will you compare God? Or what created image will you set up as His likeness?

(Isaiah 40:19) 
Can you liken Him to a carved idol? A craftsman casts a statue, and a goldsmith then covers it with plates of gold, while a silversmith fashions silver plates for it.

(Isaiah 40:20) 
One who is too poor to afford metal chooses a piece of wood that will not rot, then seeks a skilled craftsman to prepare an idol that will stand firm and not topple over.

(Isaiah 40:21) 
Do you not know these truths? Have you not heard them proclaimed? Has it not been announced to you from the very beginning of time? Have you not understood the fundamental truth of God’s creation of the entire earth?

(Isaiah 40:22) 
It is He who is enthroned above the spherical earth, and its inhabitants appear before Him like tiny locusts. He effortlessly stretches out the universe as if it were a fine curtain, and spreads it out like a vast tent for habitation.

(Isaiah 40:23) 
He brings the powerful judges and rulers of the world to utter nothingness. He renders the governors of the earth as empty and without substance.

(Isaiah 40:24) 
Indeed, they are neither planted like a tree, nor sown like a seed, nor is their lineage deeply rooted in the earth. Suddenly, He breathes a powerful wind upon them, and they instantly wither away. A whirlwind then carries them off like light stubble.

(Isaiah 40:25) 
“To whom then can you possibly compare Me, or whom will you consider My equal?” says the Holy One of God.

(Isaiah 40:26) 
Lift up your eyes to the cosmic expanse above, and see who created all these things: He who brings out their starry host by number, and calls each one by its unique name. Because of the immensity of His strength, His might, and His power, not one star is missing.

(Isaiah 40:27) 
Why do you complain, O Jacob, and why do you say, O Israel: “My path and my struggles are hidden from the Lord, and my rightful cause is ignored by my God?”

(Isaiah 40:28) 
Do you not know this, or have you not heard? The Lord is the eternal God, the Creator of the entire earth. He does not grow faint, nor does He become weary. His wisdom and understanding are utterly beyond our ability to comprehend.

(Isaiah 40:29) 
He grants strength and vigor to the weary, and He multiplies the might of those who have no power of their own.

(Isaiah 40:30) 
Even the strongest young men will grow weary and faint, and the most robust youths will utterly stumble and fall.

(Isaiah 40:31) 
But those who place their hope and trust in the Lord will find their strength renewed. They will soar on high with wings like eagles, they will run a race and not grow weary, they will walk a long journey and not faint.

(Isaiah 41:1) 
Be silent before Me, you distant lands and coastal regions. Let the nations renew their strength and their resolve. Let them come forward and then speak. Let us all approach together to make our case before judgment.

(Isaiah 41:2) 
Who has raised up from the East a righteous man? Who called him to follow God's will and purpose? Who gave nations into his view, enabling him to humble kings? He will make their armies like dust to his sword, and their forces like stubble scattered by the wind to his bow.

(Isaiah 41:3) 
He will pursue them and pass onward in peace, on a path where his own foot has never walked before—a path made easy by God.

(Isaiah 41:4) 
Who has worked and accomplished these things? Who has called forth all the generations of humanity from the very beginning of time? I am the Lord, the First and the Last, I am He.

(Isaiah 41:5) 
The distant lands saw what happened and became afraid. The farthest regions of the earth were astonished; they drew near and came together.

(Isaiah 41:6) 
Everyone helped his neighbor, and each one said to his brother: 'Take courage! Be strong!'

(Isaiah 41:7) 
The metal craftsman encouraged the goldsmith, who was hammering the idol with his mallet, saying: 'This joining is good!' And he fastened it with nails so that it would not fall or move.

(Isaiah 41:8) 
But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, My beloved friend.

(Isaiah 41:9) 
I have taken you from the very ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I have said to you: 'You are My chosen servant; I have called you, and I have never cast you away.'

(Isaiah 41:10) 
Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be dismayed or look around for help, for I am your God. I have strengthened you and helped you. I have sustained you with the triumphant right hand of My justice.

(Isaiah 41:11) 
Behold, all those who fight against you will be utterly put to shame and disgraced. They will be reduced to nothing and will perish, the men who strive against you.

(Isaiah 41:12) 
You will search for them, but you will not find those who rebelled against you. They will become as if they never existed, and those who waged war against you will be reduced to nothing.

(Isaiah 41:13) 
For I am the Lord your God, holding your right hand firmly, and saying to you: 'Do not fear; I Myself have helped you.'

(Isaiah 41:14) 
Do not be afraid, you humbled people of Jacob, you seemingly insignificant ones from Israel. I Myself have helped you, says the Lord. And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 41:15) 
Behold, I will make you like a new threshing sledge, equipped with sharp, serrated teeth. You will thresh mountains and crush them, reducing the hills to mere dust.

(Isaiah 41:16) 
You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and a strong gale will scatter them. And you yourself will rejoice triumphantly in the Lord, you will find your joy in the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 41:17) 
The poor and the needy are searching for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the Lord, will certainly hear their cries. I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.

(Isaiah 41:18) 
I will open rivers on the barren heights and springs in the middle of the valleys. I will transform the desert into refreshing pools of water, and the thirsty ground into gushing springs.

(Isaiah 41:19) 
I will plant in the barren wilderness the cedar, the acacia (also called the shittah tree), the myrtle, and the olive tree. I will set in the desert the fir, the elm, and the boxwood all together.

(Isaiah 41:20) 
So that all people may see and fully know, consider deeply, and understand together that the hand of the Lord God has accomplished this, and the Holy One of Israel Himself has created these things.

(Isaiah 41:21) 
Present your case for your gods, says the Lord. Bring forth all your strongest arguments, says the King of Jacob.

(Isaiah 41:22) 
Let your false gods come forward and tell us whatever things are yet to come. Declare to us the events of the past and explain their meaning, so that we may ponder them and understand their ultimate outcome. Or, even better, announce to us the things that are yet to come!

(Isaiah 41:23) 
Announce the things that will happen in the distant future, and then we will know that you truly are gods. Do something good, or do something evil—anything at all—so that we may understand and see it together as evidence.

(Isaiah 41:24) 
Behold, you false gods are absolutely nothing, and anything you do or claim to do is equally nothing. Whoever chooses to worship you is an abomination.

(Isaiah 41:25) 
I have raised up a ruler from the north, and he will come. From the rising of the sun (the East), I will declare his name, and he will bring down rulers and officials as if they were mere mud, trampling them down like a potter treads clay.

(Isaiah 41:26) 
Which of your false gods has announced these things from the beginning, so that we might know? Which of them foretold events long ago, so that we might say: 'He is righteous and true'? There is no one among them who declares anything, no one who proclaims, and no one who even hears your words.

(Isaiah 41:27) 
I, the Lord, am the First to say to Sion: 'Behold, the promised events are already here!' And to Jerusalem, I will send a messenger who brings good news and proclaims it.

(Isaiah 41:28) 
And I, the Lord, looked, and there was not a single one among their idols or their prophets who could give any counsel, or who could answer a single word when asked.

(Isaiah 41:29) 
Behold, all of these idols are empty and worthless. Their works are absolutely nothing, and their sculpted images are mere wind and empty air.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:1) 
Look at My Servant. I uphold Him. He is My chosen one, and my very soul is delighted by Him. I have given My Spirit to rest upon Him; He will bring forth justice to all the nations of the world.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:2) 
He will not shout for attention, nor will He raise His voice in a boastful way. His voice will not be heard loudly in the public squares.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:3) 
He will not break the weakest and most fragile among us, like a bruised reed. He will not extinguish a flickering flame, like a smoldering wick —He will preserve and restore even the weakest. He will faithfully bring forth justice, upholding the truth.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:4) 
He will not grow faint, nor will He be discouraged, until He has established true justice on the earth. Even the distant lands and all the islands will eagerly await His teaching and His law.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:5) 
This is what the Lord God says—He who created the entire universe and stretched out its vastness, He who established the Earth and all that grows from it, He who gives the very breath of life to all people upon it, and the spirit of life to all who walk on its surface.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:6) 
I, the Lord, have called you—My Servant—in righteousness, and I have taken hold of your hand. I have preserved you, and I have given you to be a New Covenant for all people, and a light to all the nations of the world.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:7) 
So that you would open the eyes of those who are spiritually blind. So that you would lead the bound captives out of their confinement. So that you would bring those who sit in the darkness of the prison house into the light.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:8) 
I am the Lord—this is My Name, the name above all names. I will not give My glory to any other, nor will I give the praise due to Me to idols or carved images.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:9) 
Look, the former prophecies have already come to pass. Now I am announcing new things to you. Even before they come into being, I will cause you to hear about them.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:10) 
Sing a new song to the Lord. Let His praise resound from the uttermost ends of the Earth. Let all those who sail on the sea, and everything that fills it—every island, and all their inhabitants—sing praises.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:11) 
Let the desert lands and all their cities lift up their voices in praise. Let the inhabitants of the tents of Kedar rejoice. Let those who dwell in the rock fortresses praise Him. Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:12) 
Let them give all glory to the Lord, and let them declare His praise throughout all the islands.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:13) 
The Lord will go forth like a mighty warrior. He will stir up His holy zeal like a man of war. He will shout His battle cry and cry aloud. He will show His great power over all His enemies.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:14) 
I have been silent for a long time. I have been still and have patiently held Myself back. Now, like a woman in childbirth, I will cry out—I will pant and gasp, and I will destroy and consume all at once.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:15) 
I will lay waste to the mountains and the hills, and I will dry up all their vegetation. I will turn rivers into dry land, like islands, and I will dry up all the stagnant pools.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:16) 
And I will lead those who are spiritually blind in a way they do not know. I will make them walk in paths they have not known before. I will turn the darkness before them into brilliant light, and I will make the crooked paths straight. These are the things I have done for them, and I have not forsaken them.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:17) 
But those who have turned back to their idols will be utterly put to shame. Those who trust in carved images and those who say to molten images, “You are our gods”—they will be confused and humiliated.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:18) 
Listen, you who are spiritually deaf. Look intently, you who are spiritually blind, so that you may truly see.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:19) 
Who is truly blind, except My servant Israel? Who is truly deaf, except the one to whom I have sent My messenger, the prophet? Who is truly blind, except he who has betrayed Me and been given over to his enemies? And who is truly blind, except this servant of the Lord?

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:20) 
You have seen many wonderful things, yet you did not pay attention. You have opened your ears, yet you did not truly hear.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:21) 
The Lord, because of His own perfect righteousness, was pleased to make His law magnificent and to bring it great honor.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:22) 
But this same people—Israel—has been plundered and ravaged. All of them are trapped in snares, and they are hidden away in prison cells. They have become prey, and there is no one to rescue them. They have been plundered, and there is no one who says, “Give it back!”

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:23) 
Who among you will truly listen to this warning? Who will pay attention and truly hear what I am saying about your future?

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:24) 
Who handed Jacob over to be plundered, and Israel over to the robbers? Was it not the Lord Himself, against whom we have sinned? For they were unwilling to walk in His ways, and they refused to listen to His law.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:25) 
So He poured out upon Israel the heat of His fierce anger and the might of a terrible war. It burned all around them, yet they did not recognize its divine cause. It consumed them with fire, yet they did not understand the meaning of it.

(Isaiah 43:1) 
And now, the Lord who created you, Jacob, and who formed you, Israel, says these things: "Do not be afraid, for I have rescued you, and I have called you by your very own name. You are Mine, My special possession."

(Isaiah 43:2) 
When you pass through difficult waters, I will be with you; even mighty rivers will not overwhelm you. When you walk through fiery trials, you will not be burned, and the flame will not scorch you.

(Isaiah 43:3) 
For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. As a ransom and a price for your freedom, I have given Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba for you.

(Isaiah 43:4) 
Since you became precious and glorious in My eyes, I have loved you. I will give other people in exchange for you, and entire nations for the sake of your life.

(Isaiah 43:5) 
Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bring your descendants from the east, and I will gather you from the west.

(Isaiah 43:6) 
I will say to the north: 'Give them up!' And to the south: 'Do not hold them back!' Bring My sons from distant lands, and My daughters from the farthest ends of the earth.

(Isaiah 43:7) 
Every person who invokes My name, I created them for My glory. I formed them, and I made them for this very purpose.

(Isaiah 43:8) 
Bring forth the people who are spiritually blind, though they possess physical eyes. Bring forth the people who are spiritually deaf, though they have physical ears.

(Isaiah 43:9) 
All the nations have gathered together, and the peoples have assembled. Who among them can declare what is coming, and who can tell us what happened in the distant past? Let them bring their witnesses to justify themselves, so that they may hear and truly say: 'It is true!'

(Isaiah 43:10) 
You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and My chosen servant. This is so that you may know Me, and believe in Me, and truly understand that I am He—the one true God. No other god was formed before Me, and no other god will exist after Me.

(Isaiah 43:11) 
I, even I, am the Lord, and there is no other savior besides Me.

(Isaiah 43:12) 
I am the one who declared the future, and I am the one who brought salvation. I made it known to you, and there was no foreign god among you to do these things. You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and I am God.

(Isaiah 43:13) 
From the very beginning of all things, I am He. There is no one who can rescue anything from My hand. When I choose to act, who can possibly stop or reverse it?

(Isaiah 43:14) 
The Lord, your Rescuer, the Holy One of Israel, says these things: 'For your sake, I have sent forces against Babylon. I will bring down all its defensive bars and gates, and bring ruin to the Chaldeans who boast in their ships.'

(Isaiah 43:15) 
I am the Lord, your Holy One, the One who created Israel, your King.

(Isaiah 43:16) 
The Lord, who made a path through the sea (as in the Exodus), and a way through raging waters, says these things.

(Isaiah 43:17) 
He is the One who led out chariots, horses, and a powerful, mighty army, (referring to the Egyptians). They all lay down together in death and did not rise again. They were crushed and extinguished like a wick of flax.

(Isaiah 43:18) 
Do not dwell on the past events; do not keep thinking about the ancient things.

(Isaiah 43:19) 
Behold, I am now doing something new, and it is already springing forth. Will you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness, and I will create rivers in desolate places.

(Isaiah 43:20) 
The wild beasts of the field will honor Me, even the jackals and the ostriches, because I provide waters in the wilderness and rivers in desolate lands. I do this to give drink to My people, My chosen ones.

(Isaiah 43:21) 
This people I formed and made for Myself; they will proclaim My praise and declare My story to the world.

(Isaiah 43:22) 
But you have not called upon Me, Jacob. And you have not toiled in worship or service for Me, Israel.

(Isaiah 43:23) 
You did not bring Me a ram for your burnt offering, nor did you glorify Me with your animal sacrifices. I did not burden you with grain offerings, nor did I impose upon you the toil of providing incense.

(Isaiah 43:24) 
You did not buy Me sweet cane (for incense) with silver, nor did you satisfy Me with the fat of your sacrifices. Instead, you have made Me serve you with your sins, and you have burdened Me with your iniquities.

(Isaiah 43:25) 
I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, because of My own nature and honor. And I will not remember your sins anymore.

(Isaiah 43:26) 
Challenge Me to a trial: present your case. Tell Me if you have anything to justify yourself.

(Isaiah 43:27) 
Your first ancestral father sinned, and your own spokesmen and mediators have rebelled against Me.

(Isaiah 43:28) 
Therefore, I have profaned your holy princes, and I have given Jacob over to utter destruction, and Israel to disgrace and reproach.

(Isaiah 44:1) 
And now, listen, Jacob, My servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.

(Isaiah 44:2) 
This is what the Lord says, He who made you and formed you from the womb, your helper: Do not fear, My servant Jacob, and be steadfast, Israel, whom I have chosen.

(Isaiah 44:3) 
For I will pour refreshing waters upon the thirsty, and abundant streams upon the dry land; I will pour My Spirit upon your offspring, and My blessing upon your descendants.

(Isaiah 44:4) 
And they will grow up quickly, like grass among other plants, like willows next to flowing water.

(Isaiah 44:5) 
One person will say: 'I belong to the Lord.' Another will declare himself by the name of Jacob. Another will write with his own hand, 'I am the Lord's,' and will be called by the name of Israel.

(Isaiah 44:6) 
This is what the Lord, the King of Israel, says, and its Redeemer, the Lord of all creation: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no God.

(Isaiah 44:7) 
And who is like Me? Let him call out, and let him declare; let him set forth his claims to Me—from the time I established the ancient people—and let them announce to you the things to come and what will happen.

(Isaiah 44:8) 
Do not fear, nor be troubled. Have I not made you hear and proclaimed these things from that time? Is it not true that I am from the beginning, and there is no God besides Me? There is no other 'rock'—no other false god—that I do not know exists.

(Isaiah 44:9) 
All who make idols are worthless, and their most cherished creations will not profit them. These idol-makers themselves are witnesses that the idols neither see nor understand, so that those who worship them may be put to shame.

(Isaiah 44:10) 
Who formed a god? And who cast a graven image that does absolutely nothing?

(Isaiah 44:11) 
Behold, all who participate in this will be put to shame. The craftsmen are merely human beings. Let them all gather, let them stand forth, and let them be terrified, and together be utterly confounded.

(Isaiah 44:12) 
The blacksmith works with a file, heating it in coals; with hammers he shapes it. He works with the full strength of his arm, but eventually, he hungers and grows faint. He drinks water and becomes weary.

(Isaiah 44:13) 
The wood craftsman stretches out his measuring line, and with a marking tool he sketches it out. He makes it with corners, and with a compass he rounds it. He then fashions an image of a man, as if of a handsome man, and sets it up to sit in a house.

(Isaiah 44:14) 
He cuts down cedars for himself; he takes a holm oak and an oak that grew among the trees of the forest. He plants a pine tree, and the rain nourishes it.

(Isaiah 44:15) 
And some of it will be for a man as fuel. He takes part of it to warm himself, and he kindles it and bakes bread. But from the rest of it, he makes a god and worships it. He carves an idol and bows down before it.

(Isaiah 44:16) 
Half of the wood he burns in the fire, and with it he cooks meat; he roasts his roast and is satisfied. He gets warm and says: 'Ah, I am warm! I have seen the fire!'

(Isaiah 44:17) 
And the rest of it he makes into a god, into a carved image for himself. He bows down before it, and worships, and implores it, saying: 'Save me, for you are my god!'

(Isaiah 44:18) 
They have neither known nor understood, for their eyes are covered so that they cannot see, and their hearts cannot understand.

(Isaiah 44:19) 
Such a person does not think in his mind, nor does he know or understand enough to say: 'I burned half of it with fire, and I baked bread over its coals. I roasted meat and ate it. And from the rest of it, shall I make an idol? Shall I prostrate myself before a mere block of wood?'

(Isaiah 44:20) 
His heart feeds on ashes. He has wandered astray in his mind and cannot deliver his soul, nor can he even recognize and say: 'Surely, there is a lie in my right hand!'

(Isaiah 44:21) 
Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, because you are My servant. I formed you, you are My servant. Israel, do not forget Me.

(Isaiah 44:22) 
I have blotted out your iniquities like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, because I have redeemed you.

(Isaiah 44:23) 
Praise, O heavens, because the Lord has accomplished this! Shout for joy, mountains, and offer praise! Let the forests and every tree in them rejoice! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and Israel will glorify Him!

(Isaiah 44:24) 
This is what the Lord, your Redeemer, says, and He who formed you from the womb: I am the Lord, who makes all things, who stretches out the universe alone, who establishes the earth, and no one was with Me.

(Isaiah 44:25) 
It is I who frustrate the signs of diviners and make fortune-tellers seem like fools. I am He who turns the wise backward and makes their knowledge seem foolish.

(Isaiah 44:26) 
It is I who confirm the word of My servant and fulfill the counsel of My messengers. I am He who says to Jerusalem: 'You shall be built!' and to the cities of Judah: 'You shall be rebuilt!' and I will raise up its desolate places.

(Isaiah 44:27) 
It is I who say to the deep waters: 'Be desolate!' and 'I will dry up your rivers!'

(Isaiah 44:28) 
It is I who say to Cyrus: 'You are My shepherd, and you shall fulfill all My will!' I am He who says to Jerusalem: 'You shall be built!' and to the Temple: 'You shall be founded!'

(Isaiah 45:45:1) 
This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, His anointed one—His chosen instrument, whom I have grasped by his right hand. I have empowered him to subdue nations before him, to make kings turn and flee, and to open city gates before him so that no city gates can be shut against him.

(Isaiah 45:45:2) 
I Myself will go before you, Cyrus, and bring down the mighty rulers of the earth. I will shatter gates of bronze and break into pieces the iron bars of cities.

(Isaiah 45:45:3) 
I will give you hidden treasures and the secret riches stored away in the dark places of conquered cities, so that you may know that I am the Lord. I am the One who calls you by your name, the God of Israel.

(Isaiah 45:45:4) 
It is for the sake of My servant Jacob, for the sake of Israel, My chosen people, that I have called you, Cyrus, by your name and given you a significant title and purpose—even though you do not know Me personally.

(Isaiah 45:45:5) 
I am the Lord, and there is no other God besides Me. There is absolutely no other God. I have armed you and prepared you for your mission, Cyrus, even though you have not known Me.

(Isaiah 45:45:6) 
I do this so that from the rising of the sun to its setting—throughout the entire world—people will know that there is no God besides Me. I am the Lord, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:7) 
I am the One who forms light and creates darkness, just as in the beginning of the universe. I am the One who brings about peace and allows calamity to occur for My purposes. I am the Lord who does all these things.

(Isaiah 45:45:8) 
Let the skies shower down from above, and let the clouds rain down the Righteous One. Let the earth open up and bring forth a Savior, and let righteousness spring up alongside Him. I, the Lord, have created all of this.

(Isaiah 45:45:9) 
Woe to the one who argues with his Maker—a mere piece of pottery among the earthen vessels! Does the clay say to its potter, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work lacks skill!'

(Isaiah 45:45:10) 
Woe to the one who says to a father, 'What kind of child are you bringing into the world?' and to a mother, 'What are you bringing forth in childbirth?'

(Isaiah 45:45:11) 
This is what the Lord says—the Holy One of Israel, your Maker and Former: 'Do you question Me about the future concerning My children? And do you presume to command Me concerning the work of My hands?'

(Isaiah 45:45:12) 
I Myself made the earth, and I created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the universe, and I gave commands to all the stars and celestial bodies within it.

(Isaiah 45:45:13) 
I have raised him up—Cyrus—for a righteous purpose, and I will make all his paths straight. He will command the rebuilding of My city, Jerusalem, and he will release My captive people, the Israelites, not for any ransom or bribe, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 45:45:14) 
This is what the Lord says: 'The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the tall men of Saba, shall come over to you, O Israel, and be yours. They shall follow behind you, coming over to you in chains of submission. They will bow down to you and plead with you, declaring: "Surely, God is only found with you, and there is no other God besides Him! There is absolutely no other God!"'

(Isaiah 45:45:15) 
Truly, You are a God who remains hidden in Your ways, O God of Israel, our Savior.

(Isaiah 45:45:16) 
All those who worship idols will be confused and ashamed. Together, the makers of false gods will go into confusion and disgrace.

(Isaiah 45:45:17) 
But Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation. You will never be put to shame or disgraced, for all eternity.

(Isaiah 45:45:18) 
For this is what the Lord says—the One who created the universe. He is God, the One who formed the earth, made it, and established it firmly. He did not create it to be a formless void or empty chaos; He formed it specifically to be inhabited. I am the Lord, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:19) 
I have not spoken in secret ways, nor from a dark, hidden place of the earth. I have not said to the descendants of Jacob, 'Seek Me in vain.' I am the Lord, speaking truth and declaring what is right.

(Isaiah 45:45:20) 
Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, you who have been rescued from the nations! They have no knowledge—those who carry around their wooden idols and pray to a god that is powerless to save them.

(Isaiah 45:45:21) 
Declare it, and come forth, and consult together among yourselves! Who has declared these things from the beginning, from ancient times, and foretold them? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me. There is no just God and no Savior apart from Me.

(Isaiah 45:45:22) 
Turn to Me, and be saved, all you ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:23) 
I have sworn by My very Self; a word of righteousness has gone out from My mouth, and it will not return to Me unfulfilled: 'For to Me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear allegiance.'

(Isaiah 45:45:24) 
Surely, in the Lord alone, they will say, 'I have righteousness and strength.' To Him shall they come, and all who raged against Him will be put to shame.

(Isaiah 45:45:25) 
In the Lord, all the descendants of Israel shall be justified, and they shall glory and praise Him.

(Isaiah 46:1) 
The idol god Bel has bowed down low, and the idol god Nebo has also stooped low. Their carved images, which you thought were gods, are now merely carried away on the backs of beasts of burden and other animals. These images are a heavy, tiring load for the animals carrying them.

(Isaiah 46:2) 
Both Bel and Nebo have stooped and bowed together, defeated. They could not even save the one who carried their images, nor could they protect the people who worshipped them. The very souls of their devotees will be led away into captivity.

(Isaiah 46:3) 
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and every last one of you from the house of Israel: I am the One who has carried you from your mother’s womb; I am the One who has borne you from the moment you were conceived.

(Isaiah 46:4) 
Even as you grow old, I Myself will be with you; even until your hair turns gray, I will carry you. I am the One who made you, and I am the One who will continue to bear your burdens. I will carry you, and I will save you.

(Isaiah 46:5) 
To whom could you possibly compare Me? Who could you make My equal, or match Me against? Who could you claim is similar to Me?

(Isaiah 46:6) 
Look at those who pour out gold from their money pouches and weigh silver on a scale. They pay a craftsman good wages to shape this metal into what they call a 'god,' and then they worship it and bow down to it.

(Isaiah 46:7) 
They have to carry it on their shoulders and bear its weight. Then they place it in its specific spot, and there it stands, unable to move from that place on its own. If they cry out to it for help, it cannot hear them, nor can it save them from any distress.

(Isaiah 46:8) 
Remember these things, and consider how foolish they are, and be ashamed. Return to your senses, you transgressors, and truly reflect on your hearts.

(Isaiah 46:9) 
Remember the events of ancient ages, for I am God, and there is no other God besides Me. There is absolutely no one like Me in all of existence.

(Isaiah 46:10) 
I am the One who declares the very end from the beginning of all things, and I announce from ancient times events that have not yet even occurred. I alone declare, 'My divine plan will stand, and My entire will shall be accomplished.'

(Isaiah 46:11) 
I am calling a swift bird from the east, and from a far-off land, I am calling forth the man of My divine counsel. I have declared this, and I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, and I will surely accomplish it.

(Isaiah 46:12) 
Listen to me, you who are hardened of heart, those of you who are far away from true righteousness.

(Isaiah 46:13) 
I have brought My righteousness near to you; it will not remain distant. My salvation will not be delayed. And I will grant salvation in Zion, and bestow My glory upon Israel.

(Isaiah 47:1) 
Descend now, O virgin daughter of Babylon, and sit in the dust. Sit on the ground, for there is no longer a throne for you, O only daughter of the Chaldeans. You will never again be called delicate and tender.

(Isaiah 47:2) 
Take the millstone and grind flour (like a slave). Uncover your shame, bare your shoulder, bare your legs as you cross the rivers (because you will be exiled and treated as a slave).

(Isaiah 47:3) 
Your nakedness and disgrace will be revealed for all to see. I will take vengeance, and no one will be able to stop Me.

(Isaiah 47:4) 
For our Redeemer is the Lord of all armies, and His name is the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 47:5) 
Sit in silence, and go into the darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms (because your dominion is over).

(Isaiah 47:6) 
I was angry with My people, so I let My inheritance be defiled and gave them into your hand (so you could conquer them). But you showed them no mercy, and you greatly intensified your cruel oppression even upon the elderly.

(Isaiah 47:7) 
You said in your heart, 'I will be a sovereign queen forever!' You did not consider these things (your cruelty and the temporary nature of your power), nor did you ever think about what your ultimate end would be.

(Isaiah 47:8) 
Therefore, listen to these things, O luxurious one who sits so securely (in your false sense of safety). You say in your heart, 'I am the only power, and there is no one else like me! I will never be a widow (losing my king or power), nor will I ever experience the sorrow of barrenness (losing my people or prosperity).'

(Isaiah 47:9) 
But these two things will come upon you suddenly, in one single day: barrenness (the loss of your people) and widowhood (the loss of your king and power). All this bitter sorrow will come upon you because of the multitude of your evil sorceries, and because of the immense, powerful enchantments of your sorcerers (which will not save you).

(Isaiah 47:10) 
You had confidence in your wickedness, and you said, 'No one sees me' (meaning, no one can judge me). Your wisdom and your knowledge, which you boasted of, have utterly deceived you. And again, you said in your heart, 'I am the only power, and there is no one else like me!'

(Isaiah 47:11) 
Therefore, evil will come upon you, and you will not know its true origin or how to stop it. Calamity will rush upon you, which you will not be able to expiate or atone for. And misery will come upon you suddenly, which you will not know how to deal with.

(Isaiah 47:12) 
Now stand firm with your enchanters and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored (and placed your trust) from your youth. See if perhaps they can profit you, or if you can, through them, become stronger (against this coming doom).

(Isaiah 47:13) 
You are exhausted by the multitude of your (useless) counsels. Let your diviners of the heavens now stand up and save you—those who gazed at the stars and proclaimed monthly what would come upon you.

(Isaiah 47:14) 
Look, they have become like mere stubble for the fire (easily consumed and gone). They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. They will offer you no comfort like warming coals, nor be a fire to sit by for guidance.

(Isaiah 47:15) 
This is what will become of those for whom you have labored (your sorcerers, enchanters, and diviners). Your merchants, with whom you have traded since your youth, have all gone their own way (abandoning you in your time of need). There is no one left to save you.

(Isaiah 48:48:1) 
Listen to these words, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and have descended from the lineage of Judah. You swear oaths in the name of the Lord and recall the God of Israel, but you do not do so with sincerity or with justice.

(Isaiah 48:48:2) 
For indeed, you were called out from the holy city, Jerusalem. You claimed to rely on the God of Israel, whose name is the Lord of all creation.

(Isaiah 48:48:3) 
The first things I declared to you long ago; they came forth from My mouth and were heard. I suddenly brought them to pass, and they happened just as I said.

(Isaiah 48:48:4) 
I knew that you are stubborn, and your neck is like an iron sinew, making you stiff-necked and rebellious. Your forehead is like bronze, making you hard-headed and unyielding.

(Isaiah 48:48:5) 
I foretold these things to you from that very time. Before they happened, I revealed them to you so that you could not possibly say, 'My idols have done these things, and my carved images and my statues commanded them to happen.'

(Isaiah 48:48:6) 
You have heard it all; now see these things! I have announced everything to you. Will you not listen? From this moment on, I will make you hear new things, things hidden from you, which you have not yet known.

(Isaiah 48:48:7) 
These new things are created and revealed now, not from before this moment. You have not heard them, not yesterday, nor at any time previously, so that you cannot possibly say, 'Behold, I already knew these things.'

(Isaiah 48:48:8) 
You have heard and you have known, and your ear has supposedly been opened; but in truth, you have not truly listened. For I know that you have acted with treachery, and I have called you a transgressor from the moment of your birth.

(Isaiah 48:48:9) 
For the sake of My holy name, I will hold back My intense fury. For My own glory, I will restrain Myself and not let My wrath consume you, so that you do not utterly perish.

(Isaiah 48:48:10) 
Behold, I have refined you in fire, but not with the intention of purifying you perfectly like silver. Rather, I have chosen to refine you in the furnace of affliction and hardship.

(Isaiah 48:48:11) 
For My own sake, yes, for My very own sake, I will do these things so that My holy name may not be blasphemed. My glory I will not give to any other god or being.

(Isaiah 48:48:12) 
Listen to Me, O Jacob, and you, Israel, whom I have called into existence. I Myself am the one true God, I am the First, and I am the Last.

(Isaiah 48:48:13) 
My hand established the earth, and My right hand spread out the entire universe. When I call them, they all stand firm in their places.

(Isaiah 48:48:14) 
Gather together, all of you, and listen! Who among your false prophets or idols has announced these things beforehand? The Lord has chosen His servant, and that servant will accomplish His will against Babylon. His strong arm will come against the Chaldeans.

(Isaiah 48:48:15) 
I have spoken, and I Myself called him forth. I brought him to his task, and I have made his path successful.

(Isaiah 48:48:16) 
Come close to me and listen to these things: From the very beginning of time, I have not spoken in secret. From the moment it happened, I was there. And now, the Lord God has sent me on this mission, and His Spirit is with me.

(Isaiah 48:48:17) 
Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord your God, teaching you what is truly beneficial. I am guiding you along the precise path you should walk.

(Isaiah 48:48:18) 
Oh, if only you had paid attention to My commands! Then your peace would have flowed like a mighty river, and your righteousness would have been like the surging waves of the sea.

(Isaiah 48:48:19) 
Your offspring would then have been as numerous as the sand, and your descendants like its countless grains. Their name would never have been cut off or destroyed from before My presence.

(Isaiah 48:48:20) 
Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Proclaim with shouts of exultation, make this known, and spread it even to the farthest reaches of the earth! Declare: 'The Lord has ransomed His servant, the people of Israel!'

(Isaiah 48:48:21) 
They did not suffer thirst in the desert when He led them out. He made water flow for them from the rock; He split open the rock, and water gushed out for them to drink.

(Isaiah 48:48:22) 
The Lord God says: There is no true peace for the wicked.

(Isaiah 49:1) 
Listen, you distant peoples and remote lands! The Lord called me before I was born. From my mother's womb, He remembered my name and knew who I was.

(Isaiah 49:2) 
He made my words like a sharp sword. He protected me under the shadow of His hand, and made me like a chosen arrow, keeping me hidden in His quiver until the right time.

(Isaiah 49:3) 
And He told me, 'You are My Servant, Israel,' for through you, I will show forth My glory.

(Isaiah 49:4) 
But I had thought, 'I have toiled for nothing! I have spent my strength uselessly and in vain!' Yet, my vindication truly rests with the Lord, and my reward is with my God.

(Isaiah 49:5) 
Now the Lord speaks, He who formed me from the womb to be His Servant, so that I may bring Jacob back to Him. Even if Israel is not gathered to Him by me, still, I am honored in the sight of the Lord, and my God has become my strength.

(Isaiah 49:6) 
And He said: 'It is too small a thing for you to be My Servant only to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the remnant of Israel. Look, I have appointed you as a light to the nations, that you may be My salvation to the ends of the earth.'

(Isaiah 49:7) 
Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to the One despised in soul, to the nation abhorred, to the servant of rulers: 'Kings will see and rise, and princes will worship your Lord, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.'

(Isaiah 49:8) 
Thus says the Lord: 'At an acceptable time, I have heard you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you. I have preserved you, and I have given you as a covenant to the people, so that you may restore the land and reclaim the desolate inheritances;'

(Isaiah 49:9) 
to say to those who are bound: 'Come forth!' and to those who are in darkness: 'Be revealed!' They will feed along the roads, and their pastures will be on all the bare heights.

(Isaiah 49:10) 
They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the scorching heat or the sun strike them, for their merciful One will lead them, and He will guide them to springs of water.

(Isaiah 49:11) 
And I will turn all My mountains into a clear path, and My highways will be raised up.

(Isaiah 49:12) 
Look, some will come from afar, and behold, others from the north and from the west, and still others from the southern land.

(Isaiah 49:13) 
Praise, O universe! Rejoice, O earth! Mountains, burst forth with praise! For the Lord has comforted His people, and He will have compassion on His afflicted ones.

(Isaiah 49:14) 
But Zion said, 'The Lord has abandoned me, and my Lord has forgotten me.'

(Isaiah 49:15) 
Can a woman forget her infant child, or fail to have compassion for the son she bore? Even if she could forget, I, your God, will never forget you.

(Isaiah 49:16) 
Look, I have inscribed your name on the palms of My hands—a sign of permanent remembrance and possession—and your walls are constantly before My eyes.

(Isaiah 49:17) 
Your builders are hurrying to rebuild you, while those who laid you waste and demolished you will quickly depart from you.

(Isaiah 49:18) 
Lift up your eyes all around, and see! All these who come are gathering to you. 'As I live,' declares the Lord, 'for you will dress yourself with all of them as with an ornament, and you will array yourself with them like a bride,' a metaphor for the Church adorned with its new members.

(Isaiah 49:19) 
For your desolate and ruined land will now be too narrow for its inhabitants. And those who devoured you will be driven far away.

(Isaiah 49:20) 
The children born to you during your desolation will still say in your hearing: 'The place is too confined for me; make room for me to dwell!'

(Isaiah 49:21) 
Then you will say in your heart: 'Who has given birth to all these for me? I was barren and childless, an exile and a captive; so who raised all these? I was forsaken and alone; where then did these come from?'

(Isaiah 49:22) 
Thus says the Lord God: 'Look, I will lift up My hand to the nations and raise My banner to the peoples, and they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders.'

(Isaiah 49:23) 
And kings will be your guardians and queens your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground and lick the dust from your feet. Then you will know that I am the Lord; and those who wait for Me will not be put to shame.

(Isaiah 49:24) 
Can plunder be taken from a mighty warrior? Or can a captive be rescued from a powerful tyrant?

(Isaiah 49:25) 
For thus says the Lord: 'Indeed, even the mighty will be taken captive, and what was seized by the strong will be rescued. And those who have judged you, I Myself will judge; and your children, I Myself will save.'

(Isaiah 49:26) 
I will make your enemies eat their own flesh—a metaphor for self-destruction and divine retribution—and they will be drunk with their own blood as with new wine. Then all flesh will know that I am the Lord, your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

(Isaiah 50:1) 
The Lord God says this: "Where is the divorce decree for your mother – the one with which I supposedly dismissed her? Or which of My creditors can you name, to whom I supposedly sold you as payment? Look, it was because of your own sins and wicked deeds that you were sold into captivity, and it was because of your crimes that your mother – the nation of Israel – was divorced from the covenant."

(Isaiah 50:2) 
"Why is it that when I came to you, there was no one present to hear Me? When I called out, there was no one to answer Me. Has My arm of power become so short and weak that I cannot redeem you? Do I lack the strength to deliver you? Watch how, with a single rebuke from Me, I can turn the sea into a desert, and make the rivers run dry. The fish in them will rot away without water, and they will die of thirst."

(Isaiah 50:3) 
I can even clothe the sky itself with darkness, making sackcloth its covering, like a symbol of mourning.

(Isaiah 50:4) 
The Lord God has given Me a trained tongue, so that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word of encouragement and truth. Every morning, He awakens My ear, training Me to listen as a disciple is taught.

(Isaiah 50:5) 
The Lord God has opened My ear to listen, and I have not rebelled against His will; I have not turned away from Him.

(Isaiah 50:6) 
I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. I did not hide My face from insult and from those who spat upon Me.

(Isaiah 50:7) 
The Lord God is My helper, therefore I have not been disgraced. Therefore, I have set My face like a very hard rock, knowing that I will not be put to shame.

(Isaiah 50:8) 
He who justifies Me is near. Who would dare to dispute My claim? Let us stand together and face each other! Who is My adversary? Let him come near to Me!

(Isaiah 50:9) 
Look, the Lord God is My helper! So then, who is the one who will condemn Me? Behold, all of these accusers will wear out like a garment; a moth will consume them.

(Isaiah 50:10) 
Who among you fears the Lord and listens to the voice of His Servant? For he who walks in deep darkness, with no light to guide him, let him put his hope in the Name of the Lord and lean on his God for support.

(Isaiah 50:11) 
But look, all of you who kindle your own fire, who gird yourselves with your own flames of self-reliance, go ahead and walk in the light of your own fire and in the flames you yourselves have kindled! This judgment comes from My hand upon you; you will lie down in sorrow and pain.

(Isaiah 51:1) 
Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord. Look back at the rock from which you were carved—the very quarry from which you were dug.

(Isaiah 51:2) 
Look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave birth to you. Remember, I called him when he was alone; then I blessed him, and I made him into a multitude.

(Isaiah 51:3) 
Therefore, the Lord will bring comfort to Zion. He will comfort all her desolate places and turn her desert into a garden of delights, like the very Garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found there, with heartfelt thanksgiving and the sound of praise.

(Isaiah 51:4) 
Pay attention to me, My people. Listen closely, My nation. For My Law will go forth from Me, and My justice will rest upon the nations as a light for all to see.

(Isaiah 51:5) 
My righteousness is near, My salvation has already gone out. My mighty arm will judge all the peoples. The distant nations are waiting for Me, and they will rely on My mighty arm.

(Isaiah 51:6) 
Lift up your eyes to the physical universe, and then look down upon the earth. For the very heavens will vanish like smoke, and the earth will wear out like a garment. All its inhabitants will perish just like these things. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will never fail.

(Isaiah 51:7) 
Listen to Me, you who know what is right—you, the people of My heart, in whose mouth My Law resides. Do not be afraid of human scorn, and do not fear their blasphemies against you.

(Isaiah 51:8) 
For a worm will consume them just as it consumes a garment. A moth will devour them just as it devours wool. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will endure for all generations.

(Isaiah 51:9) 
Awaken, awaken! Clothe yourself with strength, O mighty arm of the Lord! Awaken as in the ancient days, as in generations long past. Was it not you who struck down Rahab—the proud one—and wounded the dragon? —This refers to God's defeat of Egypt and its pharaoh.

(Isaiah 51:10) 
Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the mighty deep? Was it not you who made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass through?

(Isaiah 51:11) 
And now, those redeemed by the Lord will return. They will come to Zion with songs of praise. Everlasting joy will crown their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and all sorrow and groaning will flee away.

(Isaiah 51:12) 
I myself am your Comforter. Who are you to fear a mortal man? Why are you afraid of a mere son of man who withers like grass?

(Isaiah 51:13) 
Yet you have forgotten the Lord, your Maker, who stretched out the universe and laid the foundations of the earth. You have lived in constant fear all day long because of the fury of the oppressor who was ready to destroy. But where is the fury of that oppressor now?

(Isaiah 51:14) 
The captive will soon be set free, walking out of his bonds. He will not die in the pit, nor will his food fail him.

(Isaiah 51:15) 
For I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar. The Lord of hosts is My Name.

(Isaiah 51:16) 
I have put My words in your mouth, and in the shadow of My hand I have protected you. This is so that you may establish a new order for My people, just as if you were planting the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth. And to Zion, you will declare: 'You are My people!'

(Isaiah 51:17) 
Awaken, awaken, awaken, O Jerusalem! You have drunk from the Lord’s hand the cup of His wrath, draining it to the very dregs. You have consumed and emptied the cup of staggering.

(Isaiah 51:18) 
Among all the sons she bore, there is no one to support her. Among all the sons she nourished, there is no one to take her by the hand.

(Isaiah 51:19) 
These two calamities have befallen you—who then will mourn for you? It is desolation and destruction, famine and the sword. Who will comfort you now?

(Isaiah 51:20) 
Your sons lie helpless, cast away at the head of every street, like a stag caught in a net. They are filled with the Lord’s indignation, overwhelmed by the rebuke of your God.

(Isaiah 51:21) 
Therefore, hear this, you afflicted one, you who are drunk, but not with wine.

(Isaiah 51:22) 
Thus says your Sovereign Lord, your God, who fights for His people: 'Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering, the chalice of My indignation. You will never drink from it again.'

(Isaiah 51:23) 
And I will place that cup into the hand of those who humiliated you and who afflicted you. For you said to your soul: 'Bow down, so that we may pass over.' And you made your body like the ground itself, and like a street for those who walked over you.

(Isaiah 52:1) 
Arise, arise! Put on your strength, O Zion. Put on your glorious garments, Jerusalem, O city of the Holy One of Israel. For no one uncircumcised or unclean will ever again pass through your gates.

(Isaiah 52:2) 
Shake yourself free from the dust, stand up, and be seated in honor, Jerusalem. Release the chains from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

(Isaiah 52:3) 
For this is what the Lord says: You were sold into slavery for no price at all, and you will be redeemed without any payment.

(Isaiah 52:4) 
For this is what the Lord God says: My people went down into Egypt in the beginning to live there as temporary residents. And then, without any just cause, Assyria oppressed them.

(Isaiah 52:5) 
And now, what is left for Me here? says the Lord. For My people have been taken captive for no reason. Their rulers act unjustly, says the Lord, and My holy name is constantly blasphemed all day long because of this injustice.

(Isaiah 52:6) 
Therefore, My people will truly know My name on that day. They will understand that I, the very one who has been speaking to them, am now truly present to act.

(Isaiah 52:7) 
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces and proclaims peace, who announces what is truly good, who proclaims salvation, and who says to Zion: 'Your God reigns as King!'

(Isaiah 52:8) 
Listen! The voice of your watchmen! They have lifted up their voices in joyful song; together they will praise the Lord! For they will see eye to eye, with perfect clarity and shared understanding, when the Lord restores Zion and brings His people home.

(Isaiah 52:9) 
Break forth into joyful shouts and sing praises together, O desolate Jerusalem! For the Lord has already comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem, a certainty for the future.

(Isaiah 52:10) 
The Lord has revealed His holy arm, His mighty power to act, in the sight of all the Gentile nations. And all the ends of the earth will see the salvation that comes from our God.

(Isaiah 52:11) 
Depart, depart! Go out from there, from Babylon! Do not touch anything unclean. Go out from her midst; purify yourselves, you who carry the sacred vessels of the Lord intended for His temple.

(Isaiah 52:12) 
For you will not go out in panicked confusion, nor will you flee in haste like the Exodus from Egypt. For the Lord Himself will go before you, leading the way, and the God of Israel will gather you, protecting your rear.

(Isaiah 52:13) 
Behold, My servant will act with great wisdom and insight, fulfilling God's plan. He will be exalted and lifted up, and He will be exceedingly high in glory, speaking of His future resurrection and ascension.

(Isaiah 52:14) 
Just as many people were utterly astonished at His appearance, so disfigured was His form, beyond that of any man, and His appearance among the sons of men was beyond recognition due to suffering.

(Isaiah 52:15) 
This Servant will sprinkle many nations, performing a priestly purification and cleansing them. Kings will be utterly silent in His presence, standing in awe, for what had never been told to them they will now see, and what they had never heard they will now deeply contemplate regarding God's mysterious plan.

(Isaiah 53:1) 
Who has truly believed the message we have delivered? And to whom has the powerful, saving strength of God been revealed?

(Isaiah 53:2) 
He grew up before God, humble and unassuming, like a new shoot or a root from dry ground. He had no striking appearance, no outward splendor that would attract us. When we looked at Him, there was nothing in His visible form that would make us desire Him.

(Isaiah 53:3) 
He was despised and considered the lowest of men. He was a Man intimately acquainted with sorrows and suffering. His face was as if hidden from us by His suffering, or as if we turned our faces from Him in contempt. Indeed, He was so despised that we did not consider Him worthy of any regard.

(Isaiah 53:4) 
But in truth, He Himself carried our weaknesses and sicknesses, and He Himself bore the burden of our sorrows. Yet we thought of Him as if He were a leper, struck by God's judgment and humiliated.

(Isaiah 53:5) 
But He Himself was truly wounded because of our own rebellious sins. He was crushed and broken because of our wicked deeds. The severe punishment that brought about our peace with God was laid upon Him. And by the bruised marks of His scourging, we are spiritually healed.

(Isaiah 53:6) 
All of us, like wayward sheep, have gone astray. Each one of us has turned aside onto his own sinful path. And the Lord God placed upon Him the collective guilt and sin of all of us.

(Isaiah 53:7) 
He willingly allowed Himself to be offered as a sacrifice, and He did not open His mouth to defend Himself. He was led like a sacrificial sheep to the slaughter. And like a lamb that remains silent before its shearer, so He remained silent, truly not opening His mouth during His trial and suffering.

(Isaiah 53:8) 
He was taken away from oppression and from a biased judgment. And who can truly recount the story of His unique life or His spiritual descendants, seeing that His earthly life was cut short and He was cut off from the land of the living? For it was because of the rebellious sins of My people that I, God the Father, allowed Him to be struck down in death.

(Isaiah 53:9) 
He was indeed appointed a grave with the wicked, but in His death, His actual burial was with the rich. This was so because He had committed no sin, nor was there any deceit found in His words or actions.

(Isaiah 53:10) 
Yet it was the Lord God's divine will to crush Him with profound suffering. He laid down His very life as a perfect sin offering. Because He offered His life as a sin offering, He will see His spiritual offspring, the Church, live eternally. And through His work, the will and divine plan of the Lord will be perfectly accomplished.

(Isaiah 53:11) 
Because of the immense suffering and anguish of His soul, He will see the glorious result of His sacrifice and be completely satisfied. Through His perfect knowledge and the divine wisdom He embodies, My righteous Servant, Jesus Christ, will make many people righteous, and He Himself will carry the burden of their accumulated sins.

(Isaiah 53:12) 
Therefore, I will grant Him a place of supreme honor among the great, and He will distribute the spoils of His victory with the triumphant mighty ones. This ultimate reward is because He willingly surrendered His life unto death, and was counted among common criminals. He Himself bore the full weight of the sins of many, and He interceded in prayer on behalf of all transgressors.

(Isaiah 54:1) 
Rejoice, O barren one who has not given birth! Sing praise and shout for joy, you who have not known the pains of childbirth! For the Lord God says: the children of the deserted woman will be more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband.

(Isaiah 54:2) 
Enlarge the place of your tent. Stretch out the curtains of your dwelling places, do not hold back! Lengthen your ropes, and strengthen your tent stakes.

(Isaiah 54:3) 
For you shall spread out to the right and to the left, and your descendants will inherit the nations, and they will inhabit the cities that were once deserted.

(Isaiah 54:4) 
Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame. Do not be disgraced, for you will not suffer reproach. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.

(Isaiah 54:5) 
For the Lord God, acting as a husband, abandoned you for a time. But then, with a spirit of compassion and sadness, He called you back to be His wife, the wife of His youth. Your Husband says this, and His name is the Lord of Armies. And your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, He shall be called the God of all the earth.

(Isaiah 54:6) 
For a brief, fleeting moment, I abandoned you. But with great acts of mercy, I will gather you back to Myself.

(Isaiah 54:7) 
In a moment of My judgment, I hid My face from you for a short time. But with an everlasting act of mercy, I have had compassion on you, says the Lord God, your Redeemer.

(Isaiah 54:8) 
This covenant of My faithfulness is for Me like the waters of Noah, concerning which I swore that they should never again flood the earth. So now I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and I will not rebuke you.

(Isaiah 54:9) 
For even if the mountains are removed and the hills tremble and shake, My mercy shall not depart from you. And My covenant of peace will not be shaken, says the Lord God who shows you mercy.

(Isaiah 54:10) 
O poor little one, tossed and battered by a storm, without any earthly comfort: behold, I Myself will lay your foundation stones in their proper order, and I will lay your foundations with sapphires.

(Isaiah 54:11) 
And I will make your battlements of jasper, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of beautiful, precious stones.

(Isaiah 54:12) 
All your children shall be taught directly by the Lord God Himself, and the peace of your children will be abundant.

(Isaiah 54:13) 
And you shall be established in true justice. Stay far from all false accusation and slander, for you will have no reason to fear. And keep away from terror, for it will not come near you.

(Isaiah 54:14) 
Behold, those who gathered against you did so, but not by My counsel. Therefore, whoever gathers against you will surely fall because of you.

(Isaiah 54:15) 
Behold, I Myself created the craftsman who blows the coals in the fire and brings forth a weapon to perform his work. And I Myself created the destroyer to bring about ruin.

(Isaiah 54:16) 
No weapon that is forged against you will succeed. And you shall condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the promised inheritance of the servants of the Lord God, and their righteousness comes directly from Me, says the Lord God.

(Isaiah 55:1) 
All of you who are thirsty, come to the living waters! And you who have no money, hurry, come and buy food and drink. Come and buy wine and milk without any money or cost.

(Isaiah 55:2) 
Why do you spend your money on food that does not truly nourish you, and your labor on things that never genuinely satisfy? Listen to Me, and you will eat what is truly good. Your soul will find delight and richness in true abundance.

(Isaiah 55:3) 
Turn your ear toward Me and come to Me. Listen, and your soul will live. And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, according to the faithful mercies promised to David, which are now fulfilled in the Messiah.

(Isaiah 55:4) 
Indeed, I have given Him (the Messiah) as a witness to all peoples, a leader and a teacher for all the nations.

(Isaiah 55:5) 
Behold, you, O Messiah, will call a nation that does not know you. And nations that did not recognize you will run to you because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has brought you glory.

(Isaiah 55:6) 
Seek the Lord while He may be found. Call upon Him while He is near.

(Isaiah 55:7) 
Let the wicked abandon his sinful path, and the unrighteous man his evil thoughts. Let him return to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him, and to our God, for He is rich in forgiving.

(Isaiah 55:8) 
For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 55:9) 
For as the expanse of the sky is higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts.

(Isaiah 55:10) 
For just as the rain and snow come down from the sky and do not return there, but rather thoroughly water the earth, making it fertile and causing it to sprout, providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater—

(Isaiah 55:11) 
So also will be My Divine Word that comes forth from My mouth. It will not return to Me unfulfilled, but it will accomplish all that I desire, and it will prosper in every mission for which I have sent it.

(Isaiah 55:12) 
Indeed, you will go out with joy, and you will be led forth in peace. The mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their branches in joy.

(Isaiah 55:13) 
Instead of the thorny briar, the fragrant fir tree will grow. And in place of the stinging nettle, the beautiful myrtle tree will flourish. This will bring honor and renown to the Lord, an everlasting sign that will never be removed.

(Isaiah 56:1) 
The Lord God says this: "Guard the divine law and live righteously, because my saving grace is coming soon, and my righteousness is about to be revealed."

(Isaiah 56:2) 
Blessed is the man who does these things, and blessed is the human who keeps hold of these truths. This person keeps the Sabbath holy and does not profane it. This person keeps their hands from doing any evil.

(Isaiah 56:3) 
Let no foreign person who has joined himself to the Lord say, "The Lord has surely separated me from His people." And let no eunuch say, "Behold, I am like a barren tree that cannot bear fruit."

(Isaiah 56:4) 
For the Lord God says this to the eunuchs: "Whoever keeps my Sabbaths, and chooses what pleases me, and holds fast to my covenant with Him..."

(Isaiah 56:5) 
...I will give them a place in my holy house, within my sacred walls, and a name that is better than having sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will never perish."

(Isaiah 56:6) 
And the foreign people who have joined themselves to the Lord to worship Him and to love His name, to be His servants — all of them who keep the Sabbath without profaning it and who hold fast to my covenant —

(Isaiah 56:7) 
— I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be pleasing to me upon my altar, because my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples."

(Isaiah 56:8) 
The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed children of Israel, says this: "I will gather still more people to them, beyond those who are already gathered."

(Isaiah 56:9) 
"All you wild beasts of the open field, come to devour! All you wild beasts of the forest, come!"

(Isaiah 56:10) 
"All of their watchmen are blind; they know nothing at all. They are like mute dogs, unable to bark a warning. They see useless visions, they are always sleeping, and they love to dream."

(Isaiah 56:11) 
"They are like greedy dogs that can never be satisfied. These very shepherds have no understanding. Every one of them has turned aside to their own way, each one consumed by their own greed, from the highest leader to the lowest."

(Isaiah 56:12) 
"They say: 'Come, let us get wine and fill ourselves with drunkenness! And it will be just as it is today, so shall it be tomorrow, and even more abundantly so!'"

(Isaiah 57:1) 
The righteous person dies, and no one takes it to heart. Merciful men are taken away, because no one understands why this is happening. For the righteous person is taken away from the presence of evil.

(Isaiah 57:2) 
Let them come to a peaceful rest. Those who lived righteously will rest in their dwelling place.

(Isaiah 57:3) 
But you, come here, you children of sorcery and wickedness, you offspring of adulterers and harlots.

(Isaiah 57:4) 
At whom do you make sport? Against whom do you widen your mouth and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of rebellion, a deceitful offspring?

(Isaiah 57:5) 
You who burn with lust for idols under every leafy tree, sacrificing children in the valleys, under the high rocks.

(Isaiah 57:6) 
Among the smooth stones, that is your chosen portion; this is your destiny. And to them you poured out drink offerings and offered sacrifices. Will I not be indignant over these things?

(Isaiah 57:7) 
Upon a high and lofty mountain you set up your idolatrous altar, and there you ascended to offer sacrifices to idols.

(Isaiah 57:8) 
And behind the door and behind the doorpost you have placed your pagan symbols. For far from Me, you exposed yourselves and ascended to these high places. You widened your place for such acts and made a covenant with them. You loved their idolatrous rituals, giving yourselves completely to them.

(Isaiah 57:9) 
And you adorned yourself for the foreign king with perfume and oil, and you used many pigments. You sent your envoys far away, and you debased yourself, descending to the very depths of the underworld.

(Isaiah 57:10) 
You wearied yourself with your many, sinful ways, yet you did not say: "I will stop." You found renewed strength in your own efforts; therefore you did not utterly faint.

(Isaiah 57:11) 
For whom were you anxious, and whom did you fear, since you were false and did not remember Me, nor did you consider Me in your heart? Because of this, I also was silent, as if I saw nothing. And you committed evil, yet you thought you had nothing to fear from Me.

(Isaiah 57:12) 
I will expose your supposed righteousness, and your deeds will not bring you any benefit.

(Isaiah 57:13) 
When you cry out, let the idols you have gathered deliver you. A mere breath of wind will carry all of them away, sweeping them off completely. However, he who trusts in Me will inherit the land and will possess My holy mountain (meaning, the true Temple of God).

(Isaiah 57:14) 
And I will say: "Level the road, level it, make the path clear, remove all obstacles from the path of My people."

(Isaiah 57:15) 
For thus says the Exalted and Sublime One, who inhabits eternity, and whose name is Holy: "I, the Holy One, dwell with the contrite and humble in spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite."

(Isaiah 57:16) 
For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry. This is because the human spirit comes forth from My presence, and it is I who give all life and breath.

(Isaiah 57:17) 
Because of the iniquity of his greed, I became angry and struck him. I hid My face from you, and I was intensely angry. And he continued to wander in the way of his own stubborn heart.

(Isaiah 57:18) 
I have seen their ways (of wandering), and I healed them, and I led them back to Me. And I restored comfort to them and to those who mourned for them.

(Isaiah 57:19) 
I create the fruit of the lips—peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near (meaning both Gentiles and Jews, or those far in sin and those struggling nearby), says the Lord, and I heal him.

(Isaiah 57:20) 
But the wicked are like a restless, churning sea that cannot be still, and its waves keep tossing up mire and filth.

(Isaiah 57:21) 
"There is no peace for the wicked," says the Lord God.

(Isaiah 58:1) 
Cry out, do not be silent! Raise your voice like a trumpet, and announce to My people their serious crimes, and to the household of Jacob—the entire nation of Israel—their sins.

(Isaiah 58:2) 
Indeed, they seek Me day after day, and they claim to want to know My ways, acting as if they were a nation that truly practiced justice and and never abandoned the divine judgment of their God. They ask Me for just decisions and claim to want to draw near to God.

(Isaiah 58:3) 
They ask: “Why have we fasted, and You have not noticed? We humble ourselves, and You do not acknowledge it?” But behold, on the very day of your supposed fast, you seek only your own selfish desires, and you exact payment from all your debtors.

(Isaiah 58:4) 
Look! You fast only to engage in strife and quarrels, and you strike others with wicked fists. Do not fast as you have done up to this very day if you expect your cries to be heard on high by God.

(Isaiah 58:5) 
Is this the kind of fast that I, the Lord, have chosen? Is it merely for a person to afflict their body for one day? Is it to bow their head like a drooping reed and spread sackcloth and ashes beneath them? Would you call this a true fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?

(Isaiah 58:6) 
Is not this, rather, the genuine fast that I have chosen: to loosen the bonds that tie people to wickedness, to untie the heavy loads of oppression, to let those who are crushed go free, and to break every oppressive yoke?

(Isaiah 58:7) 
It is to share your bread with the hungry, and to bring the poor and homeless into your own house. When you see someone naked, it is to clothe them; and you must not turn away from your own kin, ignoring their needs.

(Isaiah 58:8) 
Then your light will burst forth like the morning dawn, and your healing will quickly spring up. Your righteousness will go before you, guiding your path, and the glory of the Lord will gather and protect you.

(Isaiah 58:9) 
Then you will call upon the Lord, and He will answer; you will cry out, and He will say: “Here I am!” This will happen if you remove the yoke of oppression from your midst, and stop speaking worthless words, and cease pointing the finger of scorn or accusation, and speaking lies.

(Isaiah 58:10) 
If you truly pour out your soul to the hungry, extending your whole self to them, and satisfy the needs of the afflicted soul, then your light will rise even in the midst of darkness, and your deep gloom will become as bright as the noonday sun.

(Isaiah 58:11) 
And the Lord will give you constant rest and peace forever. He will fill your soul with splendid blessings and invigorate your whole being, strengthening your very bones. You will be like a well-watered garden, and like a spring of water whose life-giving waters never run dry.

(Isaiah 58:12) 
And people will rebuild the long-desolate places through you. You will raise up the foundations that can last for many generations. You will be called “the repairer of the broken walls” and “the restorer of the ancient paths to dwell in.”

(Isaiah 58:13) 
If you turn your foot away from trampling the Sabbath—that is, from doing your own selfish will on My holy day—and if you call the Sabbath a true delight, and the Lord’s holy day glorious, and you truly honor it by not pursuing your own personal ways, and your own will is not found in idle talk or personal business, then these blessings will be yours.

(Isaiah 58:14) 
Then you will find your true delight in the Lord. I will lift you up above all the high places of the earth and feed you with the rich inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord Himself has spoken these promises.

(Isaiah 59:1) 
Look now, the power of the Lord is not too short or weak that He cannot save; nor is His ear too heavy or deaf to hear the prayers of His people.

(Isaiah 59:2) 
But your moral failures have created a division between you and your God. Your sinful actions have hidden His presence from you, preventing Him from hearing your prayers.

(Isaiah 59:3) 
For your hands are stained with the guilt of bloodshed, and your fingers are defiled by wickedness. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue has uttered malicious falsehoods.

(Isaiah 59:4) 
There is no one who calls for justice, nor anyone who judges with truthfulness. Instead, they put their trust in emptiness, and they speak what is false and useless. They conceive evil schemes, and they bring forth wickedness.

(Isaiah 59:5) 
They hatch the eggs of poisonous serpents, and they weave the webs of spiders. Whoever eats of their eggs will die from the venom, and what they carefully nourish will burst forth as a viper.

(Isaiah 59:6) 
Their spider-like webs of schemes will not serve as clothing for anyone, nor will they be covered by the results of their own actions. For their works are works of injustice, and their hands perform wicked deeds.

(Isaiah 59:7) 
Their feet run quickly towards evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are worthless and destructive thoughts. Ruin and destruction mark their paths.

(Isaiah 59:8) 
They have not known the way of peace, and there is no true justice in their footsteps—meaning their actions and decisions. Their paths are twisted and crooked for them; everyone who walks on such paths will not know peace.

(Isaiah 59:9) 
Because of this, divine justice has moved far away from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hoped for light, but behold, there is only darkness; we looked for brightness, but we walk in thick gloom.

(Isaiah 59:10) 
Like blind people, we grope along a wall, and like those without eyes, we stumble forward. We trip at midday as if it were dark, and in places of abundance, we are like the dead.

(Isaiah 59:11) 
We all roar like bears in distress, and we moan mournfully like doves. We have waited for divine judgment to set things right, but it has not come; we have hoped for salvation, but it remains far from us.

(Isaiah 59:12) 
For our moral failures have multiplied before You, O God, and our sins themselves bear witness against us. Indeed, our wicked deeds are with us always, and we have recognized our own unrighteousness.

(Isaiah 59:13) 
We have been false and lied to the Lord, and we have turned away from following the steps of our God. We have spoken slander and defamation, conceiving and uttering from our hearts words of deceit.

(Isaiah 59:14) 
And true justice has been turned back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has fallen in the public square, and equity has been unable to enter there.

(Isaiah 59:15) 
And truth has been forgotten, and he who turns away from evil becomes prey. And the Lord saw this, and it displeased Him that there was no justice being rendered.

(Isaiah 59:16) 
And He saw that there was no man to intervene—no one to act righteously. He was astonished that there was no one to intercede. So His own mighty power brought salvation for His people, and His righteousness itself sustained them.

(Isaiah 59:17) 
He clothed Himself with righteousness as a breastplate, and put a helmet of salvation upon His head. He dressed Himself with garments of vengeance, and was covered with zeal like a cloak.

(Isaiah 59:18) 
He will come for vengeance, for a just repayment of His indignation against His enemies, and He will render recompense to His adversaries. He will pay back the distant lands according to their deeds.

(Isaiah 59:19) 
And those from the west will fear the Name of the Lord, and those from the rising of the sun will fear His glory, when He comes like a rushing river driven by the very Spirit of the Lord.

(Isaiah 59:20) 
And the Redeemer will come to Mount Zion, and to those in the house of Jacob who turn away from their moral failures, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 59:21) 
"This is My covenant with them," says the Lord: "My Spirit who rests in you, and My words which I have placed in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your children's children," says the Lord, "from this present time and even unto eternity."

(Isaiah 60:1) 
Arise, Jerusalem, and shine forth, for your light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you.

(Isaiah 60:2) 
Behold, thick darkness will cover the earth, and deep gloom will encompass the peoples. But the Lord will rise upon you, and His glory will be visible in you.

(Isaiah 60:3) 
And nations will walk by means of your light, and kings by the brightness of your rising.

(Isaiah 60:4) 
Lift up your eyes all around you and see: all these people have gathered and come to you. Your sons will come from far away, and your daughters will be carried at your side (tenderly, as one carries a beloved child).

(Isaiah 60:5) 
Then you will see this, and you will overflow with joy. Your heart will be amazed and greatly expanded, when the abundance of the sea and the wealth of the nations is turned towards you and comes to you.

(Isaiah 60:6) 
Vast numbers of camels will cover your land, dromedaries from Midian and Ephah. All of them will come from Sheba, bringing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming the praise due to the Lord.

(Isaiah 60:7) 
All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered for your sake; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you. They will be offered upon My altar, which makes propitiation, and I will glorify the house of My majesty.

(Isaiah 60:8) 
Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves returning swiftly to their dovecotes?

(Isaiah 60:9) 
For the distant lands await Me, and the ships of the sea are prepared (ready to sail), so that I may bring your sons from afar, bringing their silver and their gold with them, to the Name of the Lord your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.

(Isaiah 60:10) 
And the sons of foreigners will build your walls, and their kings will serve you. For in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor and mercy, I have had compassion on you.

(Isaiah 60:11) 
And your gates will be opened continuously, day and night, so that the wealth of the nations may be brought to you, and their kings may be led in.

(Isaiah 60:12) 
For any nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish; indeed, those nations will be utterly laid waste and left desolate.

(Isaiah 60:13) 
The glory of Lebanon will come to you—the fir, the boxwood, and the pine together—to adorn the place of My sanctuary. And I will glorify the place where My feet rest (the Temple or My holy habitation).

(Isaiah 60:14) 
And the sons of those who humbled you will come bowed down to you. All who scorned you will prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet. And they will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 60:15) 
In place of your former state, when you were forsaken and hated, and no one would even pass through you, I will make you an eternal glory, a joy for every generation.

(Isaiah 60:16) 
You will draw sustenance from the nations and be nourished by kings. And you will know that I am the Lord, your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

(Isaiah 60:17) 
Instead of bronze, I will bring you gold; and instead of iron, I will bring you silver; and instead of wood, bronze; and instead of stones, iron. I will make your governance to be peace, and your taskmasters to be justice.

(Isaiah 60:18) 
Violence will no longer be heard in your land, nor devastation or destruction within your borders. Salvation will occupy your walls, and praise will guard your gates.

(Isaiah 60:19) 
The sun will no longer be your light during the day, nor will the brilliance of the moon illuminate you. Instead, the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.

(Isaiah 60:20) 
Your sun will never set again, and your moon will no longer wane, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will come to an end.

(Isaiah 60:21) 
Then all your people will be righteous; they will inherit the land forever. They are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, intended for My glory.

(Isaiah 60:22) 
The smallest among you will become a thousand, and the least will become a mighty nation. I, the Lord, will accomplish this swiftly in its appointed time.

(Isaiah 61:1) 
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me for a specific mission. He has sent me to preach good news to those who are humble and teachable, to heal those whose hearts are broken by sorrow, to announce freedom to those who are held captive, and to declare release to those who are imprisoned.

(Isaiah 61:2) 
He has sent me to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor—a time of grace and salvation—and to declare the day of our God’s justice, when He will bring judgment against His enemies. My mission is also to comfort all who mourn.

(Isaiah 61:3) 
I am sent to bring comfort to the mourners in Zion, and to give them a crown instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness and despair. They will then be called mighty oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for His own glory.

(Isaiah 61:4) 
They will rebuild the ancient ruins that have been desolate for ages. They will restore the cities that were laid waste and scattered throughout many generations.

(Isaiah 61:5) 
And foreigners will stand ready to tend your flocks. The children of strangers will be your farmers and your vinedressers, helping you with your labor.

(Isaiah 61:6) 
But you, the redeemed people, will be called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of our God, serving Him in His holy temple. You will feed on the strength and wealth of the nations, and you will glory in their splendor.

(Isaiah 61:7) 
Instead of the double shame and disgrace you have endured, your people will praise their portion. Because of this, they will possess double in their own land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.

(Isaiah 61:8) 
For I, the Lord, love justice and hate robbery and injustice, even when offered as a burnt offering to me. Therefore, I will truly give them their reward, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

(Isaiah 61:9) 
Their offspring will be known among the nations, and their descendants among the peoples. All who see them will recognize them, that they are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed.

(Isaiah 61:10) 
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul will exult and triumph in my God, for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in the robe of righteousness. He has adorned me like a bridegroom with a garland, and like a bride bedecked with her jewels.

(Isaiah 61:11) 
For just as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and just as a garden causes its seeds to grow, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

(Isaiah 62:1) 
For the sake of the City of God, I will not be silent. For the sake of the people of Jerusalem, I will not rest, until her righteousness shines forth like brilliant light, and her salvation burns brightly like a lamp.

(Isaiah 62:2) 
Then the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings will behold your glory. You will be called by a new name, a name that the mouth of the Lord Himself will declare.

(Isaiah 62:3) 
You will be a crown of splendor in the hand of the Lord, a royal diadem in the right hand of your God.

(Isaiah 62:4) 
You will no longer be called 'Forsaken', and your land will no longer be called 'Desolate'. Instead, you will be called 'My Delight is in Her' (which means God takes pleasure in you), and your land 'Inhabited'. For the Lord Himself takes delight in you, and your land will be settled with people.

(Isaiah 62:5) 
For just as a young man settles down with a virgin, so your sons will settle and live within you. And just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.

(Isaiah 62:6) 
Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have placed watchmen. All day and all night, they will never be silent. You who bring the Lord to remembrance, never be silent.

(Isaiah 62:7) 
And do not give Him any rest, until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her a city praised throughout the earth.

(Isaiah 62:8) 
The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: 'I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies. Foreigners will no longer drink the wine for which you have toiled.'

(Isaiah 62:9) 
Instead, those who harvest the grain will eat it and praise the Lord. And those who gather the wine will drink it in the courtyards of My holy sanctuary.

(Isaiah 62:10) 
Go out, go out through the gates! Prepare the way for the people! Make the highway level, clear away the stones! Raise a banner for all the nations!

(Isaiah 62:11) 
Behold, the Lord has made a proclamation to the furthest ends of the earth! Say to the Daughter of Zion: 'Behold, your Savior comes! His reward is with Him, and His just recompense is before Him.'

(Isaiah 62:12) 
And they will be called 'The Holy People', 'The Redeemed of the Lord'. And you, O Jerusalem, will be called 'Sought Out' and 'A City Never Forsaken'.

(Isaiah 63:1) 
Who is this one coming from the land of Edom, his garments stained crimson from the city of Bozrah? Who is this one, so glorious in his robe, marching forth in the fullness of his power? He answers, “I am the one who proclaims righteousness, and I am a mighty defender to save.”

(Isaiah 63:2) 
So why then are your garments red, and your robes like those of someone treading grapes in a winepress?

(Isaiah 63:3) 
I alone have trodden the winepress, and of all the nations, there was no one with me to help. I trampled them down in my burning fury, and I crushed them in my hot wrath. Their lifeblood splattered upon my garments, and I have stained all my clothing with it.

(Isaiah 63:4) 
For the day of vengeance was determined in my heart, and the year for my people’s deliverance and retribution upon their enemies has now come.

(Isaiah 63:5) 
I looked all around, but there was no helper; I sought, but there was no one to assist. So my own mighty arm brought me victory, and my fierce indignation sustained me and gave me strength.

(Isaiah 63:6) 
And I trampled down entire nations in my fury, and I overwhelmed them with my indignation as if they were drunk. And I brought their power crashing down to the earth.

(Isaiah 63:7) 
I will recount the manifold mercies of the Lord; I will sing praises to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon us. I will recall the abundance of good things He has given to the house of Israel, which He bestowed upon them according to the greatness of His compassion and the multitude of His tender mercies.

(Isaiah 63:8) 
And He said: “Surely they are My people, My children who will not prove false to Me.” And so, He became their Savior.

(Isaiah 63:9) 
In all their affliction, He Himself was not afflicted, for the angel of His presence saved them. In His boundless love and His tender compassion, He personally redeemed them. He carried them and lifted them up throughout all the days of the ages.

(Isaiah 63:10) 
But they, in turn, rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He turned against them as an enemy, and He Himself fought against them.

(Isaiah 63:11) 
Then He remembered the days of old, the days of Moses and His people. The Lord asked, “Where is He who brought out from the sea the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who placed His Holy Spirit within them?”

(Isaiah 63:12) 
It was He who led Moses by his right hand, by His glorious majestic arm. He divided the waters of the sea before them to make for Himself an everlasting name for all time.

(Isaiah 63:13) 
He led them through the deep waters as easily as a horse walks through the desert without stumbling.

(Isaiah 63:14) 
Just like cattle returning to their pasture, the Spirit of the Lord was their guide. In this way, You led Your people, to make for Yourself a glorious name.

(Isaiah 63:15) 
Look down, O Lord, from the highest heavens, and behold us from Your holy and glorious dwelling place. Where is Your zealous care and Your mighty power? Where are the multitude of Your tender mercies and Your deep compassion? Are they now withheld from me?

(Isaiah 63:16) 
For You alone are our Father. Even if Abraham did not know us, and Jacob did not acknowledge us, You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer! From all eternity, this is Your name.

(Isaiah 63:17) 
Why, O Lord, have You allowed us to wander from Your ways? Why have You hardened our hearts so that we no longer revere You? Turn back, we pray, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your own inheritance.

(Isaiah 63:18) 
Why have You momentarily brought low Your holy people? Our enemies have now taken possession of Your holy sanctuary.

(Isaiah 63:19) 
We have become as though we were from the very beginning, when You had not yet ruled over us, and Your name was not yet invoked upon us.

(Isaiah 64:1) 
If only you would tear open the sky and come down to us, the mountains would melt away at your presence and power!

(Isaiah 64:2) 
Just as a fire burns away brushwood, and as a roaring fire makes water boil, so too would these mountains vanish and be utterly consumed. Do this so that you might make your power known to your enemies, and the nations would be terrified at your presence.

(Isaiah 64:3) 
When you have performed awesome, terrible deeds, we have waited for your appearance. You have descended in the past, and the mountains melted away at your presence and power.

(Isaiah 64:4) 
Since the beginning of time, no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen, O God, any other god but you who has prepared such wonders for those who wait for you.

(Isaiah 64:5) 
You come to meet those who rejoice in doing what is right and just. They will remember you as they walk in your paths. But truly, you were angry, and we sinned against you. We have remained in our sins and have been living in them constantly. Yet, even so, we trust that we shall be saved!

(Isaiah 64:6) 
Indeed, all of us have become like something ritually unclean, and all our supposed good deeds are like a soiled, discarded cloth. We have all withered and fallen away like a leaf, and our sins, like a strong wind, have swept us away into darkness.

(Isaiah 64:7) 
There is no one among us who truly calls upon your name, no one who truly rises up to seek and take hold of you. You have hidden your presence from us, and you have crushed us and delivered us into the power of our own sins.

(Isaiah 64:8) 
And yet now, O Lord, you are still our Father. We are merely the clay, and you are our divine Potter. All of us are the complete work of your own hands.

(Isaiah 64:9) 
Do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord, and please do not remember our sins forever! Look upon us, we beg you—we are all your own people.

(Isaiah 64:10) 
Your holy city has become a desolate wasteland. Zion itself has become a barren wilderness. Jerusalem is utterly destroyed.

(Isaiah 64:11) 
The very Temple, the house of our holiness and our glory, where our fathers praised you, has been utterly consumed by fire. And all our precious, desirable things have been reduced to rubble and ruin.

(Isaiah 64:12) 
Despite all these things, O Lord, will you continue to hold yourself back? Will you remain silent and afflict us so severely, allowing us to be utterly destroyed?

(Isaiah 65:65:1) 
Those who had not previously asked Me, searched for Me. Those who had not sought Me, found Me. I said, 'Here I am! Here I am!' to a nation—meaning the Gentiles—that never called upon My name.

(Isaiah 65:65:2) 
I continually extended My hands all day long to a disobedient people—My chosen nation, Israel—who walked in a path that was not good, choosing to follow their own rebellious thoughts.

(Isaiah 65:65:3) 
This is a people who constantly provoke My anger right before My face. They offer sacrifices in pagan gardens and burn incense on altars made of bricks, instead of honoring Me according to My law.

(Isaiah 65:65:4) 
These are people who dwell in tombs and sleep in pagan shrines, seeking to consult the dead. They eat the flesh of swine and have the broth of unclean things in their vessels—all of which are an abomination to Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:5) 
These are the ones who say, 'Keep away from me, do not come near me, for I am holier than you, and you would make me unclean!' Such people will be like smoke, consumed by My fiery anger, a fire that burns continuously throughout the day.

(Isaiah 65:65:6) 
Behold, it is written before Me: I will not remain silent, but I will surely repay. I will give them the full measure of their just retribution into their very laps.

(Isaiah 65:65:7) 
Your wickedness, along with the wickedness of your fathers together, says the Lord, who offered pagan sacrifices upon the mountains and publicly insulted Me upon the hills—I will repay the full measure of all their past sins into their laps.

(Isaiah 65:65:8) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Just as when a cluster of grapes is found to have one good grape, people say, 'Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing within it,' so also will I do for the sake of My faithful servants, so that I will not utterly destroy all of My people.

(Isaiah 65:65:9) 
And I will bring forth a remnant from Jacob, and from Judah will come those who inherit My holy mountains. My chosen ones will possess this land as their inheritance, and My faithful servants will live there securely.

(Isaiah 65:65:10) 
And the plains will become lush pastures for flocks of sheep, and the Valley of Achor—once a place of trouble—will become a peaceful resting place for herds of cattle. This will be for My people who have faithfully sought Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:11) 
But as for you who have abandoned the Lord, you who have forgotten My holy mountain of Zion, you who set a table in honor of the pagan god of Fortune, and who prepare wine offerings for the pagan goddess of Destiny—

(Isaiah 65:65:12) 
I will count you out for the sword, and all of you will fall in a great slaughter. This is because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen. Instead, you did what was evil in My sight and deliberately chose what greatly displeased Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:13) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Behold, My faithful servants will eat and be satisfied, but you who rebelled will hunger. Behold, My servants will drink and be refreshed, but you will thirst. Behold, My servants will rejoice with gladness, but you will be put to utter shame.

(Isaiah 65:65:14) 
Behold, My servants will sing praises with overflowing joy from their hearts, but you will cry out with bitter sorrow in your hearts, and you will wail from the crushing despair of your spirit.

(Isaiah 65:65:15) 
And you who rebelled will leave your names as a curse and an oath for My chosen ones—meaning, 'May God do to me what He did to them.' The Lord God will put you to death, but He will call His faithful servants by a new name, signifying their new identity in Him.

(Isaiah 65:65:16) 
So that whoever is blessed upon the earth will be blessed in the God of Truth, and whoever takes an oath on earth will swear by the God of Truth. This will happen because the former troubles and sorrows are completely forgotten and hidden from My eyes forever.

(Isaiah 65:65:17) 
For behold, I am about to create new heavens and a new earth—a completely renewed creation. The former things, filled with sorrow and sin, will not even be remembered, nor will they ever come to mind.

(Isaiah 65:65:18) 
Instead, you will rejoice and be utterly exultant forever in the things that I am creating. For behold, I am creating Jerusalem to be a source of great rejoicing, and her people to be a source of profound joy.

(Isaiah 65:65:19) 
And I Myself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in My people. In that renewed city and among My people, the sound of weeping and the sound of distressful crying will never be heard again.

(Isaiah 65:65:20) 
In that time, there will no longer be an infant who lives only a few days, nor an old person who fails to complete the full measure of their years. For the one who dies at a hundred years old will be considered a mere child; but the sinner who lives a hundred years will still be cursed and face judgment.

(Isaiah 65:65:21) 
They will build houses and live in them securely. They will plant vineyards and enjoy their fruit.

(Isaiah 65:65:22) 
They will not build a house for someone else to live in; they will not plant a vineyard for someone else to eat its fruit. For the days of My people will be like the days of the Tree of Life itself, and they will fully enjoy the work of their hands.

(Isaiah 65:65:23) 
They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children destined for trouble or calamity. For they and their descendants are the blessed offspring of the Lord, and their grandchildren will remain with them.

(Isaiah 65:65:24) 
And it will be that even before they call out to Me, I will hear them. While they are still speaking their prayers, I Myself will immediately answer them.

(Isaiah 65:65:25) 
The wolf and the lamb will feed together in peace, and the lion will eat straw like the ox—its predatory nature transformed. As for the young serpents, dust will remain their food, signaling the final triumph over evil. There will be no harm or destruction anywhere on My holy mountain of creation, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:1) 
The Lord says these things: "The entire universe is My throne, and the earth is where I rest My feet. What kind of house could you possibly build for Me? And what kind of place could be My resting place?"

(Isaiah 66:2) 
"My hand made all these things, and all of them came into being," declares the Lord. "But who am I going to look upon with favor? Only those who are humble in spirit, those who have a contrite spirit, and those who tremble at My words."

(Isaiah 66:3) 
"Whoever sacrifices an ox, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who murders a man. Whoever sacrifices a lamb, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who sacrifices a dog's brain, which is an abomination. Whoever offers a grain offering, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who offers pig's blood, which is unclean. Whoever burns incense as a memorial, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who blesses an idol. All of these are things they have chosen according to their own corrupted ways, and their souls have delighted in their abominable practices."

(Isaiah 66:4) 
"Therefore, I will also choose their vexations, and I will bring upon them the very things they feared. This is because I called out to them, and there was no one who responded. I spoke, and they did not listen. Instead, they did evil in My sight, and they chose what I did not desire."

(Isaiah 66:5) 
"Listen to the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word. Your brethren, who hate you and cast you out because of My name, have said, 'Go far from us, for the Lord is honored!' But the Lord will appear in your joy, and those who persecuted you will be put to shame."

(Isaiah 66:6) 
There is a voice of a people crying out from the city. There is a voice crying out from the Temple. It is the voice of the Lord, rendering retribution to His enemies.

(Isaiah 66:7) 
Before she was in labor, she gave birth. Before her pains came, she bore a male child.

(Isaiah 66:8) 
Who has ever heard such a thing? And who has seen things like this? Will a land give birth to an entire nation in one day? Or will a whole people be born all at once? For Zion has travailed and given birth to her children.

(Isaiah 66:9) 
"Will I, who brings to the point of birth, then close the womb and not let her give birth?" declares the Lord. "Or will I, who forms all things, then shut the womb and prevent new life?" says your God.

(Isaiah 66:10) 
Rejoice with Jerusalem, and exult in her, all you who love her. Rejoice with her with joy, all you who mourn over her.

(Isaiah 66:11) 
so that you may nurse and be filled from the breast of her consolation. So that you may draw milk and overflow with delights from her abundant glory.

(Isaiah 66:12) 
For the Lord says these things: "Behold, I will extend peace to Jerusalem like a flowing river, and like an overflowing torrent, the glory and wealth of the nations will come to you, which you will draw from. You will be carried on her sides, and on her knees, you will be tenderly cared for."

(Isaiah 66:13) 
"Just as a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you. And in Jerusalem, you will find consolation."

(Isaiah 66:14) 
"You will see it, and your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like fresh grass, full of new life. And the hand of the Lord will be known to His servants, but He will show His wrath to His enemies."

(Isaiah 66:15) 
For behold, the Lord will come in fire, and His chariots will be like a whirlwind, to render His fury in indignation and His rebuke in a flame of fire.

(Isaiah 66:16) 
For the Lord will judge with fire and by His sword He will judge all flesh, and many will be slain by the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:17) 
"Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, following one among them in secret rituals, those who eat swine's flesh, and abominable things, and even mice—they will all be consumed together," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:18) 
"For I know their works and their thoughts. I am coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they will come and see My glory."

(Isaiah 66:19) 
"And I will set a sign among them. And from those who are saved among them, I will send them to the nations by the sea: to Africa and Lydia, nations known for their skilled archers; to Italy and Greece; to distant islands, to those who have not heard of Me and have not seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations."

(Isaiah 66:20) 
"And they will bring all your brethren from all nations as an offering to the Lord, conveyed on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and in wagons, to My holy mountain Jerusalem," declares the Lord. "This will be just as the sons of Israel bring their offering in clean vessels into the house of the Lord."

(Isaiah 66:21) 
"And I will also choose some of them, even from the Gentiles, to serve as priests and as Levites," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:22) 
"For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I am making, will stand firm before Me," declares the Lord, "so also will your offspring and your name stand firm forever."

(Isaiah 66:23) 
"And it will be that from one new moon to the next new moon, and from one Sabbath to the next Sabbath, all flesh will come to worship before My face," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:24) 
"And they will go out and see the corpses of the men who transgressed against Me. Their worm will not die, and their fire will not be extinguished. And they will be a terrifying spectacle to all flesh, a perpetual warning against sin."

(Jeremiah 1:1) 
These are the prophetic words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, who was one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.

(Jeremiah 1:2) 
The Word of the Lord first came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah.

(Jeremiah 1:3) 
It continued through the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, and lasted until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, when Jerusalem was carried away into exile during the fifth month — this was the full duration of his prophetic ministry.

(Jeremiah 1:4) 
Then the Word of the Lord came directly to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 1:5) 
“Before I created your physical form in your mother’s womb, I knew you. And before you were born, I consecrated you to My service, appointing you as a prophet to all the nations.”

(Jeremiah 1:6) 
But I said: “Oh, Lord God! I cannot speak for You, for I am but a youth and I don’t know what to say.”

(Jeremiah 1:7) 
But the Lord said to me: “Do not say, ‘I am a youth.’ For wherever I send you, you shall go, and everything I command you to say, you shall speak.

(Jeremiah 1:8) 
Do not be afraid of anyone’s presence, because I Myself am with you to deliver you,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 1:9) 
Then the Lord stretched out His hand and touched my mouth — an act of divine commissioning and empowerment. And the Lord said to me: “Behold, I have now put My very own words in your mouth.

(Jeremiah 1:10) 
Look! Today I have given you authority over nations and over kingdoms. You are to uproot nations, tear them down, destroy them, and overthrow them through your prophecies. And you are also to build up and to plant new beginnings through your prophecies.”

(Jeremiah 1:11) 
Then the Word of the Lord came to me again, saying: “Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I answered: “I see an almond branch” — the first tree to wake and blossom in spring, symbolizing God’s watchful readiness.

(Jeremiah 1:12) 
And the Lord said to me: “You have seen well! For I Myself will be watchful over My word to ensure that I perform it.”

(Jeremiah 1:13) 
The Word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying: “What do you see now?” And I said: “I see a boiling pot, and its mouth is tilted from the north,” indicating the direction from which the judgment will come.

(Jeremiah 1:14) 
Then the Lord said to me: “Calamity and evil will be unleashed from the north upon all the inhabitants of this land.

(Jeremiah 1:15) 
For behold, I am summoning all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” declares the Lord. “And they will come, and each one will set his royal throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem. They will also attack all its surrounding walls and all the cities of Judah.”

(Jeremiah 1:16) 
I will then pronounce My judgments against them for all their wickedness. They abandoned Me, offered libations to foreign gods, and worshipped the idols made by their own hands.

(Jeremiah 1:17) 
Therefore, you, Jeremiah, must prepare yourself for action. Arise and speak to them everything that I command you. Do not be afraid of their presence or dread their faces,

(Jeremiah 1:18) 
“—for behold, I have made you today like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall against the entire land — against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land.

(Jeremiah 1:19) 
They will fight against you, but they will not prevail over you, because I am with you,” declares the Lord, “to deliver you from them.”

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:2) 
Go and proclaim to Jerusalem, saying: The Lord declares: "I remember your devotion from when you were young, and the great love you had for Me when we were first espoused. You followed Me through the wilderness, through land that was not cultivated."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:3) 
Israel was consecrated to the Lord, the very firstfruits of His harvest. Anyone who tried to destroy Israel was found guilty and brought disaster upon themselves, the Lord declares.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:4) 
Listen to the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families within the house of Israel:

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:5) 
The Lord declares: "What injustice did your ancestors find in Me that made them abandon Me? They pursued empty idols and became empty themselves."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:6) 
They did not ask: "Where is the Lord who brought us up from the land of Egypt? Where is the One who led us through the wilderness—through a desolate and impassable land, through a land of drought and the shadow of death, a land where no one journeyed and no human dwelled?"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:7) 
I brought you into a fertile land—a garden paradise—to enjoy its fruits and its goodness. But when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:8) 
Even the priests did not ask: "Where is the Lord?" Those who were supposed to teach the Law did not truly know Me. The leaders of the people rebelled against Me. The prophets spoke in the name of Baal and pursued worthless idols.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:9) 
Therefore, I will again bring a charge against you, declares the Lord. I will contend with your children's children, and they will answer for your sins.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:10) 
Cross over to the coasts of the Cypriots and observe! Send messengers to Kedar and carefully consider if anything like this has ever happened!

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:11) 
Has any nation ever changed its gods, even though those gods are not real? Yet My people have exchanged their true glory—Me—for an idol that brings no benefit.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:12) 
Be utterly shocked, O universe, at this! Look with horror and be completely devastated, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:13) 
For My people have committed two great evils: they have abandoned Me, the very spring of life-giving water, and they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:14) 
Is Israel a slave? Or was he born into slavery? Why then has he become prey to his enemies?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:15) 
Lions have roared over him; they have raised their voices in triumph. They have made his land a desolate wasteland. His cities have been burned to ashes, and no one lives in them.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:16) 
Even the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes—the Egyptians—have utterly disgraced you. They have shaved your head bare, taking away your dignity.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:17) 
Did this not happen to you because you abandoned the Lord your God, at the very time He was leading you on your path?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:18) 
And now, what do you want for yourself on the way to Egypt, that you may drink the muddy waters of the Shihor? And what good will it do you on the way to Assyria, that you may drink the waters of the Nile?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:19) 
Your own wickedness will punish you, and your turning away will condemn you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to abandon the Lord your God, and that you have no reverent fear of Me, declares the Lord God of all creation.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:20) 
Long ago, you broke My yoke and tore off My bonds, declaring: "I will not serve You!" Indeed, on every high hill and under every leafy tree, you prostrated yourself like a prostitute.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:21) 
I Myself planted you as a choice vine, an entirely true seed. How then have you turned into a degenerate, wild vine in My sight?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:22) 
Even if you wash yourself with soda and use much lye soap, the stain of your guilt remains before Me, declares the Lord God.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:23) 
How can you say: "I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals"? Look at your ways in the valley, understand what you have done! You are like a swift, restive young camel, running aimlessly.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:24) 
You are like a wild ass, accustomed to the wilderness, snorting for passion in her desire. Who can turn her away from her lust? All who seek her will find her when she is in heat.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:25) 
You try to hold your foot back from running bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said: "It's hopeless! No, I have loved foreign gods, and after them I will go!"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:26) 
Just as a thief is put to shame when he is caught, so the house of Israel will be put to shame—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:27) 
They say to a wooden idol: "You are my father," and to a stone idol: "You gave birth to me." They have turned their backs to Me, not their faces. But in the time of their affliction, they will say: "Arise and deliver us!"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:28) 
Where are your gods that you made for yourselves? Let them rise up and deliver you in your time of affliction! For you have as many gods, O Judah, as you have cities.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:29) 
Why do you want to bring a charge against Me? You have all abandoned Me, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:30) 
In vain I struck your children; they did not accept correction. Your own sword devoured your prophets, like a devastating lion.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:31) 
O generation, consider the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land that yields nothing? Why then do My people say: "We have broken free; we will not come to You any more"?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:32) 
Can a virgin forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding dress? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:33) 
How skillfully you prepare your path to pursue your lovers! So much so that you have taught even the wicked women your evil ways.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:34) 
Even on your clothes, the blood of innocent, poor people is found. You did not catch them breaking into your house; their blood was openly shed for all to see.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:35) 
Yet you say: "I am innocent; surely His anger has turned away from me." Behold, I will bring a charge against you because you insist: "I have not sinned."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:36) 
How contemptible you have made yourself, so readily changing your paths! You will be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were disappointed by Assyria.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:37) 
Even from there you will go forth with your hands on your head in shame, for the Lord has rejected those you trusted, and you will find no help from them.

(Jeremiah 3:1) 
They have a saying: 'If a man divorces his wife, and that divorced woman marries another man, will she ever return to him? Wouldn't that woman be defiled and stained forever?' Yet you, O Israel, have committed spiritual adultery with many false lovers; nevertheless, return to Me, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:2) 
Look up to the barren heights and see where you have not prostituted yourself. You sat by the roadsides, waiting for your lovers, like a highwayman ambushing in the desert, and the land has been defiled by your spiritual adultery and your wickedness.

(Jeremiah 3:3) 
Because of this, the early rains were withheld, and there was no spring rain. You have taken on the shameless face of a harlot; you refused to be ashamed of your sins.

(Jeremiah 3:4) 
Even now you call out to Me, saying: 'My Father, You were the guide of my youth, the One who led me in purity.'

(Jeremiah 3:5) 
Will God be angry forever? Will His wrath endure to the very end? This is what you say, but you continued to do all the evil things you possibly could.

(Jeremiah 3:6) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying: 'Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has gone up to every high mountain and under every green tree, practicing spiritual prostitution there.'

(Jeremiah 3:7) 
And I thought: 'After she has done all these things, she will surely return to Me.' But she did not return to Me. And her treacherous sister, Judah, saw all this.

(Jeremiah 3:8) 
I saw that because unfaithful Israel had committed spiritual adultery, I had divorced her and given her a certificate of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid to do the same, but she too went and acted like a prostitute.

(Jeremiah 3:9) 
And with utter disregard, she committed her spiritual adultery. She defiled the land by committing adultery with idols of stone and wood.

(Jeremiah 3:10) 
And in spite of all these warnings, treacherous Judah did not return to Me with her whole heart, but only pretended to repent, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:11) 
Then the Lord said to me: 'Apostate Israel has proven herself more righteous than treacherous Judah by comparison.'

(Jeremiah 3:12) 
Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: 'Return, apostate Israel!' declares the Lord. 'I will not look on you with anger, for I am merciful,' declares the Lord, 'and I will not remain angry forever.'

(Jeremiah 3:13) 
'Only acknowledge your guilt—that you have rebelled against the Lord your God, and have given your love to foreign gods under every green tree, and have not obeyed My voice,' declares the Lord your God.

(Jeremiah 3:14) 
Return, O wayward children!' declares the Lord, 'for I am your true husband. I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and bring you to My holy mountain, Zion.'

(Jeremiah 3:15) 
And I will give you shepherds who follow My heart, and they will nourish you with true knowledge and sound teaching.

(Jeremiah 3:16) 
And in those days, when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land,' declares the Lord, 'people will no longer speak of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. It will not come to mind, nor will they remember it or miss it; no new one will be made.'

(Jeremiah 3:17) 
At that time, Jerusalem will be called 'The Throne of the Lord.' And all nations will gather there, to Jerusalem, in the name of the Lord, and they will no longer follow the stubborn evil of their hearts.

(Jeremiah 3:18) 
In those days, the house of Judah will unite with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave to your fathers as an inheritance and a place of rest.

(Jeremiah 3:19) 
But I myself said, 'How will I adopt you as My children and give you a desirable land, a glorious heritage among the nations?' And I said, 'You will call Me 'My Father' and will not turn away from following Me.'

(Jeremiah 3:20) 
But just as a wife proves faithless to her husband, so have you, O house of Israel, been unfaithful to Me,' declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:21) 
A sound is heard on the barren heights—the weeping and cries for mercy of the children of Israel, because they have corrupted their ways and forgotten the Lord their God.

(Jeremiah 3:22) 
'Return, you wayward children, and I will heal your waywardness.' And they answer: 'Here we are! We come to You, for You are the Lord our God!'

(Jeremiah 3:23) 
Surely, the worship on the multitude of hills and the clamor on the mountains were deceptive and vain. Truly, in the Lord our God alone is the salvation of Israel.

(Jeremiah 3:24) 
And shame has covered what we worshipped on the mountains since our youth: their names, their silver, their gold, their wood, and their stones—all the idols we made.

(Jeremiah 3:25) 
We must lie down in our shame, and our disgrace will cover us. For we have sinned against the Lord our God, both we and our fathers, from our youth even to this very day, and we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God.

(Jeremiah 4:4:1) 
“If you truly return, O Israel,” says the Lord, “you must turn back to Me completely. And if you remove all your idols from My sight, then you will not be disturbed or cast away.

(Jeremiah 4:4:2) 
Then you will solemnly swear: ‘As the Lord lives!’ and you will do so truthfully, justly, and righteously. And then, the nations who observe this will bless Him, and find their own praise and honor in Him.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:3) 
For this is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your uncultivated land. Prepare your hearts for a new beginning. Do not sow among thorns, which will choke out any good seed.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:4) 
Circumcise yourselves spiritually for the Lord. Remove the foreskins of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Do this lest My righteous indignation go forth like a fire and burn so fiercely that no one can extinguish it, all because of the evil practices and pursuits you continue.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:5) 
“Announce this throughout Judah and make it heard in Jerusalem! Speak up! Blow the trumpet in the land! Shout urgently and declare: ‘Gather together! Let us retreat into the fortified cities for protection!’”

(Jeremiah 4:4:6) 
“Raise a warning flag in Zion! Brace yourselves! Do not stand still or hesitate, because I am bringing disaster from the north, a great and terrible destruction.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:7) 
A lion has come up from his lair—a destructive enemy, the plunderer of nations, has been stirred up. He has left his place to make your land a wasteland. Your cities will be devastated, and no one will live in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:8) 
Because of this coming disaster, put on sackcloth. Mourn deeply and wail aloud, for the Lord’s fierce anger has indeed turned against us.

(Jeremiah 4:4:9) 
“And it will happen on that day,” says the Lord, “that the king’s courage will fail, and the princes’ resolve will collapse. The priests will be utterly astonished, and the prophets will be amazed and confounded.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:10) 
Then I, Jeremiah, said: “Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God! Have You then deceived this people and Jerusalem, by saying: ‘Peace will be for you’? Yet now, behold, the sword of war has reached even to our very souls, bringing death and despair.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:11) 
In that appointed time, it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: “A scorching wind comes from the desert road, O daughter of My people. It is not a gentle wind to cool you or to cleanse you.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:12) 
A mighty, destructive wind will come to Me from those northern lands. Now indeed, I will speak My judgments and execute them against My people.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:13) 
Behold, the enemy will advance like storm clouds, and his chariots will rush forward like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are utterly devastated!

(Jeremiah 4:4:14) 
Wash your heart clean from wickedness, O Jerusalem, so that you may be saved! How long will these harmful and sinful thoughts dwell within you?

(Jeremiah 4:4:15) 
For a voice is now announcing the approaching danger from Dan, the northernmost tribe. And it is making known the idol-worship from Mount Ephraim, which is the cause of this coming judgment.

(Jeremiah 4:4:16) 
Announce to the nations! Behold, Jerusalem has heard the news through her watchmen: a siege is coming from a distant land! The enemy has raised its battle cry against the cities of Judah.

(Jeremiah 4:4:17) 
Like watchmen guarding fields, they—the invaders—have encircled Jerusalem, because she despised Me, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 4:4:18) 
Your own ways and your evil practices have brought these things upon you. This is your wickedness, because it is bitter in its fruits, and because it has penetrated deep into your very heart.

(Jeremiah 4:4:19) 
My inner being, my inner being is in pain, and my heart aches with anguish! My very core is disturbed within me; I cannot be silent. For my soul has heard the sound of the trumpet, the dreadful sound of the battle cry!

(Jeremiah 4:4:20) 
Destruction upon destruction is announced! All the land is being laid waste. Suddenly my dwelling places are destroyed; in an instant, my tents are in ruins.

(Jeremiah 4:4:21) 
How long must I witness the people fleeing, and hear the terrifying sound of the trumpet?

(Jeremiah 4:4:22) 
“Because My people are foolish, they have not truly known Me. They are senseless children, lacking understanding and wisdom. They are skilled and wise only in doing evil, but they have not learned how to do good.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:23) 
I looked at the earth, and behold, it was desolate and utterly void, like the primordial chaos. And I looked at the skies, and there was no light in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:24) 
I saw the mountains, and behold, they were trembling. All the hills were disturbed and shaking.

(Jeremiah 4:4:25) 
I looked, and behold, there was no human being. Every bird of the sky had fled away.

(Jeremiah 4:4:26) 
I saw, and behold, the fertile land of Carmel was a desert. Every city belonging to it was demolished before the face of the Lord, and before the terrible wrath of His fury.

(Jeremiah 4:4:27) 
For this is what the Lord says: “All the land will be a desolation. However, I will not make a complete end of it, so that some remnant will remain.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:28) 
Because of this, the earth will mourn, and the skies above will darken in sorrow. This is because I have spoken, I have intended it, and I have not repented of My decision, nor have I turned away from My decree.

(Jeremiah 4:4:29) 
From the sound of the cavalry and the archers, the people fled. They ran into the forests and climbed upon the rocks for refuge. All the cities were abandoned, and no human being remained living in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:30) 
And you, O ravaged Jerusalem, what will you do now? Though you clothe yourself in scarlet, and adorn yourself with golden jewelry, and paint your eyes with dark kohl, you will adorn yourself in vain. Your former allies and lovers have despised you; they will seek to take your very life.

(Jeremiah 4:4:31) 
For I have heard a voice like that of a woman in labor, the deep distress like one giving birth for the first time. It is the voice of the daughter of Zion, gasping for breath and dying in agony, stretching out her hands in despair. Woe is me! For my soul fails within me because of all those who are slain!”

(Jeremiah 5:5:1) 
Go through the streets of Jerusalem and look, observe, and search in its public places. See if you can find even one person who practices justice and lives faithfully before God. If you can, I will spare the entire city.

(Jeremiah 5:5:2) 
And even when they swear, saying, 'As the Lord lives,' they are swearing falsely in their hearts.

(Jeremiah 5:5:3) 
O Lord, your eyes look for faithfulness in people. You struck them, but they felt no sorrow for their sins. You crushed them with your judgments, but they refused to accept discipline. They have made their faces harder than rock itself and refused to turn back to You.

(Jeremiah 5:5:4) 
But I, Jeremiah, thought: 'Perhaps these are only the poor and foolish people, those who do not know the Lord’s way or the justice required by their God.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:5) 
So I will go to the prominent leaders and speak with them, for they certainly know the Lord’s way and the justice demanded by their God. But look, they too have together broken the yoke of God’s law and have burst His bonds.

(Jeremiah 5:5:6) 
Therefore, a lion from the forest has struck them down. A wolf of the evening has laid waste to them. A leopard watches continually over their cities. Everyone who ventures out from within them will be seized and torn apart. This is because their transgressions have become exceedingly numerous, and their apostasies against God have grown strong.

(Jeremiah 5:5:7) 
Considering all these things, how can I possibly show you mercy, O Judah? Your children have abandoned Me and have sworn their oaths by those who are not gods at all. I filled them with abundance, yet they committed adultery, and they indulged themselves in the houses of prostitutes.

(Jeremiah 5:5:8) 
Every one of them has become like a lustful, neighing horse. Each man whinnies after his neighbor's wife with unbridled desire.

(Jeremiah 5:5:9) 
Shall I not bring judgment for these things, declares the Lord? Or shall My very soul not take vengeance on such a nation as this?

(Jeremiah 5:5:10) 
Go up onto her walls and tear them down, but do not utterly destroy everything. Cut off her branches, for they do not belong to the Lord.

(Jeremiah 5:5:11) 
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt with Me with extreme treachery, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 5:5:12) 
They have denied the very existence and power of the Lord, saying, 'He is nothing! Evil will not come upon us, nor will we ever see war or famine.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:13) 
The prophets also speak mere wind; there is no divine message from God in their words. Therefore, these judgments will indeed happen to them instead.

(Jeremiah 5:5:14) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of the armies of heaven, says: 'Because you, O false prophets and people, have spoken this word of denial and falsehood, behold, I am putting My true words, spoken through Jeremiah, into your mouth as a raging fire, and this people will be like wood, and My words will consume them entirely.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:15) 
Behold, O house of Israel, I am bringing upon you a nation from far away, declares the Lord. It is a strong nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you will not understand, nor will you be able to comprehend what they say.

(Jeremiah 5:5:16) 
Their quiver is like an open tomb, for all their warriors are mighty.

(Jeremiah 5:5:17) 
And they will consume your harvests and your bread. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will devour your vines and your fig trees. And with the sword, they will destroy your fortified cities, in which you place your trust.

(Jeremiah 5:5:18) 
Nevertheless, even in those dreadful days, declares the Lord, I will not make a complete end of you.

(Jeremiah 5:5:19) 
And when you ask, 'Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them: 'Just as you abandoned Me and served foreign gods in your own land, so too will you be forced to serve strangers in a land that is not your own.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:20) 
Declare this message to the house of Jacob, and make it heard in Judah, saying:

(Jeremiah 5:5:21) 
Hear this, O foolish and senseless people! You have eyes, but you refuse to see; you have ears, but you choose not to hear.

(Jeremiah 5:5:22) 
Do you not fear Me, declares the Lord? Will you not tremble before My presence? It is I who set the sand as the sea’s boundary, an eternal decree it cannot pass. Though its waves surge and roar, they cannot prevail, and though they swell, they cannot cross over it.

(Jeremiah 5:5:23) 
But this people has developed a stubborn and rebellious heart. They have turned away from Me and have departed from My ways.

(Jeremiah 5:5:24) 
They do not say in their hearts, 'Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives us the seasonal rains, both the autumn and spring showers at their proper time, and who preserves for us the full bounty of the annual harvest.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:25) 
Your iniquities have caused all this abundance to be withheld, and your sins have turned away every good thing from you.

(Jeremiah 5:5:26) 
For among My people, wicked men are found. They lie in wait, just like bird catchers setting snares and traps to capture other people.

(Jeremiah 5:5:27) 
Just as a cage is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. And by means of this deception, they have become great and have grown rich.

(Jeremiah 5:5:28) 
They have become well-fed and sleek. They have wickedly ignored My words. They have not judged the cause of the widow, nor have they taken up the case of the orphan, and they have failed to uphold the rights of the poor.

(Jeremiah 5:5:29) 
Shall I not bring judgment for these things, declares the Lord? Or shall My very soul not take vengeance on such a nation as this?

(Jeremiah 5:5:30) 
A dreadful and astonishing thing has taken place in this land.

(Jeremiah 5:5:31) 
The prophets spoke false prophecies, and the priests ruled in agreement with them. And My people loved to have it so! But what will you do then, when the end comes for all of this?

(Jeremiah 6:1) 
Prepare yourselves, O children of Benjamin, and flee from the midst of Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal over Beth-Haccerem! For a great evil is being seen coming from the north, and a mighty destruction is approaching.

(Jeremiah 6:2) 
I have compared the daughter of Zion—the city of Jerusalem—to a beautiful and delicate woman.

(Jeremiah 6:3) 
Against her will come shepherds and their flocks—these are the invading armies. They will pitch their tents all around her, and each one will graze their flocks in her fields, taking possession of her land.

(Jeremiah 6:4) 
The invaders cry out, 'Prepare for war against her! Rise up, let us attack her at noon!' Then they lament, 'Woe to us, for the day is declining! The evening shadows are growing long!'

(Jeremiah 6:5) 
So they determine, 'Rise up, let us attack by night, and let us destroy her palaces!'

(Jeremiah 6:6) 
For this is what the Lord of hosts says: 'Cut down her trees, and cast up a siege mound all around Jerusalem. This is the city marked for punishment, for all manner of oppression is found within her.'

(Jeremiah 6:7) 
Just as a cistern keeps its water fresh, so she—Jerusalem—has kept her wickedness fresh and flowing. Nothing but violence and ruin will be heard within her walls.

(Jeremiah 6:8) 
Receive instruction, O Jerusalem! Be warned, lest My soul finally depart from you, lest I make you a desolate land, utterly uninhabitable.

(Jeremiah 6:9) 
This is what the Lord of hosts says: 'They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel, like grapes in a vineyard, down to the last cluster. Return, you invaders, like a grape-gatherer to his basket, and glean again!'

(Jeremiah 6:10) 
To whom shall I speak? Whom shall I warn so that they might listen? Behold, their ears are spiritually uncircumcised and closed; they cannot hear. Behold, the Word of the Lord has become an object of scorn to them, and they do not accept it.

(Jeremiah 6:11) 
Therefore, I am full of the Lord's wrath; I am weary of holding it in. I must pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together. Indeed, I will pour it out upon man and woman alike, upon the old man and the one full of days—even the very aged.

(Jeremiah 6:12) 
Their houses will pass to others, their fields and their wives will be taken together. For I will stretch out My punishing hand upon the inhabitants of this land, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 6:13) 
For from the least of them to the greatest, everyone is given over to greed and covetousness. From the prophets to the priests, all practice deceit.

(Jeremiah 6:14) 
They tried to heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people—Israel—with superficial and shameful words, saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there was no peace at all.

(Jeremiah 6:15) 
They will certainly be put to shame because they committed such abominations. But instead of being ashamed, they were not at all confused by their own wickedness and did not know how to blush. Therefore, they shall fall among those who are falling; in the time of their visitation—their punishment—they shall stumble, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 6:16) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Stand by the ways and look, and ask for the ancient paths. Ask which is the good way, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.' But they—the people—replied, 'We will not walk in it.'

(Jeremiah 6:17) 
And I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they replied, 'We will not listen!'

(Jeremiah 6:18) 
Therefore, hear, O you nations, and know, O assembly of peoples, how great the judgments are that I will bring upon them!

(Jeremiah 6:19) 
Hear, O earth! Behold, I am bringing calamity upon this people—it is the fruit of their own evil thoughts and plans. For they have not listened to My words, and they have rejected My law.

(Jeremiah 6:20) 
To what purpose do you bring Me frankincense from Sheba, and sweet-smelling cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not accepted by Me, and your sacrifices have not pleased Me.

(Jeremiah 6:21) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will set stumbling blocks before this people; upon them, fathers and sons shall stumble together. Neighbor and friend shall perish together.'

(Jeremiah 6:22) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, a people is coming from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the farthest reaches of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 6:23) 
They will grasp bow and shield; they are cruel and will show no mercy. Their voice will roar like the surging sea, and they will ride upon horses, arrayed as a warrior prepared for battle against you, O daughter of Zion—Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 6:24) 
We have heard the report of them, and our hands are paralyzed with fear. Anguish has seized us, and pains like those of a woman in childbirth.

(Jeremiah 6:25) 
Do not go out into the fields, and do not walk on the roads, for the sword of the enemy brings terror and destruction all around.

(Jeremiah 6:26) 
O daughter of My people, gird yourself with sackcloth and sprinkle yourself with ashes! Mourn as for an only son, and make a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.

(Jeremiah 6:27) 
I have made you, Jeremiah, an assayer among My people, a strong one. You are to know and test their way—their conduct.

(Jeremiah 6:28) 
All of them are rebellious princes, walking deceitfully. They are like bronze and iron—hardened and thoroughly corrupt.

(Jeremiah 6:29) 
The bellows have blown out, and the lead is consumed by the fire. The refiner has melted the ore in vain, for their wickedness is not consumed or purged away.

(Jeremiah 6:30) 
Call them rejected silver, for the Lord has cast them away as worthless.

(Jeremiah 7:7,1) 
The Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 7:7,2) 
“Stand at the gate of the Lord’s Temple and proclaim this message there. Say, ‘Listen to the word of the Lord, all of you people of Judah, who come through these gates to worship the Lord!’”

(Jeremiah 7:7,3) 
“This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Amend your ways of living and your daily actions. If you do, I will continue to let you dwell in this place.

(Jeremiah 7:7,4) 
Do not trust in the lies being told when people say, “This is the Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord!” —as if the building itself will save you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,5) 
For only if you truly amend your ways of living and your daily actions, and if you truly act justly with one another,

(Jeremiah 7:7,6) 
and if you do not oppress the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and if you do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow after other gods—which would only bring evil upon yourselves—

(Jeremiah 7:7,7) 
only then will I allow you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.

(Jeremiah 7:7,8) 
But now, look, you are trusting in deceitful words that cannot help you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,9) 
You steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely by God’s name, offer sacrifices to the pagan god Baalim, and then go after other foreign gods whom you have no true knowledge of.

(Jeremiah 7:7,10) 
And after all this, you come and stand before Me in this Temple, where My name is invoked, and you say, “We are safe now!” simply because you have committed all these abominations.

(Jeremiah 7:7,11) 
Has this Temple, where My name is invoked by you, become nothing more than a hideout for robbers in your eyes? Yes, I Myself have seen this, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 7:7,12) 
Go now to My former dwelling place in Shiloh, where My name first dwelled among you, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people, Israel.

(Jeremiah 7:7,13) 
And now, because you have done all these wicked deeds, declares the Lord—even though I spoke to you persistently, rising early to speak, but you did not listen; and I called to you, but you did not answer—

(Jeremiah 7:7,14) 
I will do to this Temple, where My name is invoked and in which you place your trust, and to this land that I gave to you and your ancestors, exactly what I did to Shiloh.

(Jeremiah 7:7,15) 
I will cast you out of My sight, just as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the descendants of Ephraim—the northern kingdom of Israel.

(Jeremiah 7:7,16) 
Therefore, you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not offer up any praise or prayer on their behalf. Do not plead with Me, because I will not listen to you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,17) 
Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

(Jeremiah 7:7,18) 
The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make ritual cakes for the “Queen of Heaven” —a pagan goddess. They pour out drink offerings to other foreign gods, all of which provokes My wrath.

(Jeremiah 7:7,19) 
Is it really Me they are provoking? declares the Lord. No, they are only provoking themselves, bringing shame and disgrace upon their own faces.

(Jeremiah 7:7,20) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, My fury and My indignation will be poured out upon this place—upon the people, upon the animals, upon the trees of the region, and upon the produce of the earth. It will ignite, and it will not be quenched.”

(Jeremiah 7:7,21) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Go ahead and add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat all the meat yourselves—I have no desire for them.

(Jeremiah 7:7,22) 
For when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them primarily about burnt offerings and other sacrifices.

(Jeremiah 7:7,23) 
Instead, this is the command I gave them: ‘Listen to My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you, so that it may go well with you.’

(Jeremiah 7:7,24) 
But they did not listen, nor did they pay any attention. Instead, they walked according to their own desires and the stubborn wickedness of their evil hearts. They turned their backs on Me and did not move forward.

(Jeremiah 7:7,25) 
From the day your ancestors departed from the land of Egypt until this very day, I have sent all My servants the prophets to you, tirelessly sending them day after day, rising early to send them.

(Jeremiah 7:7,26) 
Yet they did not listen to Me, nor did they pay any attention. Instead, they stubbornly stiffened their necks and behaved even worse than their ancestors.

(Jeremiah 7:7,27) 
You will speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You will call to them, but they will not answer you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,28) 
Then you are to say to them: ‘This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of the Lord their God, nor has it accepted correction. Faithfulness has perished, and it is no longer found in their mouths.

(Jeremiah 7:7,29) 
Cut off your hair and throw it away, and then raise a lamentation on the bare heights—a public mourning ritual. For the Lord has rejected and abandoned the generation that has aroused His wrath.

(Jeremiah 7:7,30) 
“For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the Lord. They have placed their detestable idols in the Temple where My name is invoked, thereby defiling it.

(Jeremiah 7:7,31) 
They have also built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—a horrifying act which I never commanded, nor did it ever enter My mind.

(Jeremiah 7:7,32) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when this place will no longer be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but instead, ‘The Valley of Slaughter.’ People will be forced to bury the dead in Topheth because there will be no other space left.

(Jeremiah 7:7,33) 
The dead bodies of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.

(Jeremiah 7:7,34) 
I will silence the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bridegroom and the bride, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, for the entire land will be utterly devastated and uninhabited.”

(Jeremiah 8:1) 
“At that time,” the Lord declares, “they will dig up the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.

(Jeremiah 8:2) 
They will then spread those bones out before the sun, the moon, and all the celestial bodies—which they loved, which they served, which they followed, which they sought out, and which they worshipped. The bones will not be gathered or buried; instead, they will lie like refuse on the surface of the earth,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:3) 
And all the survivors from this evil lineage, those who remain in all the places where I have driven them, will prefer death over life,” declares the Lord of Armies.

(Jeremiah 8:4) 
Then you are to say to them: “This is what the Lord says: 'When someone falls, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not come back?'

(Jeremiah 8:5) 
Why then has this people of Jerusalem turned away with such stubborn defiance? They cling to lies and refuse to return to Me.

(Jeremiah 8:6) 
I have listened and heard: no one speaks what is good, no one repents of their wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone rushes headlong into their chosen path, like a horse charging wildly into battle.

(Jeremiah 8:7) 
Even the kite in the sky knows its appointed seasons; the turtle-dove, the swallow, and the stork observe the time of their migration. But My people do not know the judgment of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:8) 
How can you say, 'We are wise, and the Law of the Lord is with us'? Indeed, the lying pen of the scribes has turned it into a falsehood. Their interpretation is a lie.

(Jeremiah 8:9) 
The wise are put to shame; they are terrified and trapped. For they have rejected the word of the Lord, so what wisdom is left in them?

(Jeremiah 8:10) 
Therefore, I will give their wives to strangers and their fields to new inheritors. For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for dishonest gain; from prophet to priest, everyone practices deceit.

(Jeremiah 8:11) 
They treat the brokenness of My people superficially, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no true peace.

(Jeremiah 8:12) 
They ought to be ashamed because they have committed such abominations. Yet, they are not at all ashamed; they do not even know how to blush. Therefore, they will fall among those who are falling; at the time of their punishment, they will collapse,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:13) 
“I will surely gather them for destruction,” declares the Lord. “There are no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf has withered. What I had given them has passed away from them.”

(Jeremiah 8:14) 
“Why do we sit here idly? Gather together, and let us enter the fortified cities and be silent there, for the Lord our God has made us silent and given us bitter, poisonous water to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:15) 
We waited for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, there was only turmoil.

(Jeremiah 8:16) 
The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their mighty steeds, the whole land trembles. They have come and devoured the land and everything in it—the city and its inhabitants.

(Jeremiah 8:17) 
For behold, I am sending among you venomous serpents—vipers whose bites cannot be charmed away. And they will bite you,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:18) 
My sorrow is beyond sorrow; my heart is mournful within me.

(Jeremiah 8:19) 
Listen! The cry of my people is heard from a distant land: 'Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King not there?' 'Why then have they provoked Me to anger with their carved idols and with their worthless foreign gods?'

(Jeremiah 8:20) 
The harvest is over, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.

(Jeremiah 8:21) 
For the brokenness of my people, I am crushed; I am grieved, and despair has overwhelmed me.

(Jeremiah 8:22) 
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the wound of my people not been healed?

(Jeremiah 9:1) 
If only my head were a fountain of water, and my eyes an endless spring of tears! Then I could cry day and night for all the people of my nation who have been violently killed.

(Jeremiah 9:2) 
Oh, if only I had a traveler's lodging place far away in the desert! Then I would abandon my own people and run away from them. For they are all spiritually unfaithful to God, acting like adulterers, and their whole assembly is full of those who rebel against God's laws.

(Jeremiah 9:3) 
They make their tongues like a taut bow, ready to shoot out lies instead of truth. They have grown strong in their evil ways in the land, constantly progressing from one sin to another. 'They have not truly known Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:4) 
Let everyone be on guard against their neighbor, and do not trust any brother. For every brother will try to trip you up with deceit, and every friend will walk about spreading slanders and lies.

(Jeremiah 9:5) 
People will mock their own brother, and they will refuse to speak the truth. For they have specifically trained their tongues to speak only lies. They have behaved wickedly, and they refuse to turn away from their sins and repent.

(Jeremiah 9:6) 
Your dwelling place is entirely surrounded by treachery. They continue to act in deceit, and because of this, they have not truly known Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:7) 
Therefore, the Lord of heavenly armies says this: 'Behold, I will refine them through suffering, and I will test their hearts like metal. For what else can I possibly do with the behavior of My people?'

(Jeremiah 9:8) 
Their tongue is a deadly, wounding arrow, always speaking deceit. With their mouth, they speak words of peace to their neighbor, but secretly, they set traps and snares for them.

(Jeremiah 9:9) 
Because of all these sins, 'Shall I not visit them with My judgment?' says the Lord. 'And for a nation behaving in this manner, shall My very soul not take vengeance?'

(Jeremiah 9:10) 
I will take up a lament and mourning over the mountains, and a dirge over the beautiful pastures of the wilderness. For they have been so utterly burned and laid waste that no one can even pass through them. No sound of human or animal is heard, for even the birds of the sky and the cattle have fled away and are gone.

(Jeremiah 9:11) 
I will turn Jerusalem into heaps of rubble, a den for wild jackals. And I will make the cities of Judah utterly desolate, with no one left to live in them.

(Jeremiah 9:12) 
Who is truly wise enough to understand this? To whom has the Lord spoken clearly enough to explain it? Why has the land perished? Why has it become desolate like a wilderness, with no one left to even pass through it?

(Jeremiah 9:13) 
And the Lord Himself answered, saying: 'This has happened because they abandoned My law, which I gave to them. They did not listen to My voice, and they refused to live according to My commands.'

(Jeremiah 9:14) 
Instead, they followed the stubborn wickedness of their own hearts and pursued the Baals—the false gods that their fathers had taught them to worship.

(Jeremiah 9:15) 
Therefore, the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says this: 'Behold, I will feed this people with a bitter herb, like wormwood, and I will give them poisonous water to drink, like gall.'

(Jeremiah 9:16) 
I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have ever known. And I will send the sword of war after them, until they are completely consumed and destroyed.

(Jeremiah 9:17) 
The Lord of heavenly armies says this: 'Pay close attention! Call for the professional mourning women to come; send for those who are skilled in lamentation, and tell them to hurry!'

(Jeremiah 9:18) 
Let them hurry and begin a lament over us, so that our eyes may stream with tears, and our eyelids pour out floods of water.

(Jeremiah 9:19) 
For a voice of lamentation is heard coming from Zion: 'How utterly destroyed we are! How profoundly we are shamed! For we have been forced to abandon our land, and our homes have been torn down and ruined!'

(Jeremiah 9:20) 
Therefore, women, listen to the word of the Lord! Let your ears receive the solemn words that come from His mouth. Teach your daughters how to lament, and let each woman teach her neighbor a mournful dirge.

(Jeremiah 9:21) 
For death has climbed through our windows; it has entered our very homes. It has come to kill the little children playing outside and the young men gathered in the public squares.

(Jeremiah 9:22) 
Speak this message: 'Thus says the Lord: The corpses of men will fall like dung upon the surface of the land, and they will be like grain bundles left behind the reaper, with no one left to gather them for burial.'

(Jeremiah 9:23) 
The Lord says this: 'Let no wise person boast in their own wisdom, and let no strong person boast in their own strength, and let no rich person boast in their own riches.'

(Jeremiah 9:24) 
But if anyone desires to boast, let them boast in this: that they truly know and understand Me—that I am the Lord who demonstrates steadfast mercy, unwavering justice, and righteousness throughout the earth. For these are the things that please Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:25) 
'Behold, the days are coming,' says the Lord, 'when I will bring judgment upon everyone who is circumcised physically but still holds an uncircumcised heart—meaning, they are outwardly religious but inwardly rebellious.'

(Jeremiah 9:26) 
This judgment will come upon Egypt, and upon Judah, and upon Edom, and upon the Ammonites, and upon Moab, and upon all those desert dwellers who shave the hair at the corners of their temples as a pagan practice. For while all these other nations are physically uncircumcised, the entire house of Israel is, in a more profound way, uncircumcised in their heart, showing no true devotion to God.

(Jeremiah 10:1) 
Pay attention to the message of the Lord that He has spoken to you, O house of Israel.

(Jeremiah 10:2) 
The Lord says this: Do not learn to live according to the ways of the gentile nations, and do not be afraid of the signs in the sky, which those pagan nations fear.

(Jeremiah 10:3) 
Because the customs of other peoples are empty and meaningless. It is a tree cut from the forest, an object crafted by the hands of a carpenter with an axe.

(Jeremiah 10:4) 
They make it beautiful with silver and gold. Then they fasten it with nails and hammers so that it will not fall over or move.

(Jeremiah 10:5) 
They are like a scarecrow standing in a cucumber field; they cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk on their own. Therefore, do not fear them, because they cannot do any evil, nor can they do any good.

(Jeremiah 10:6) 
There is no one like you, O Lord. You are truly great, and your name is mighty in strength.

(Jeremiah 10:7) 
Who would not fear you, King of all nations? Indeed, honor is properly due to you. Among all the wise people of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one who is like you.

(Jeremiah 10:8) 
All of them will equally prove to be foolish and stupid. The teaching of their worthless idols is nothing more than wood.

(Jeremiah 10:9) 
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Ophir. It is the work of a craftsman and the hands of a goldsmith. Blue and purple cloth form their clothing. All these idols are simply the work of human artisans.

(Jeremiah 10:10) 
But the Lord is the true God. He is the living God, and the eternal King. The earth trembles at His indignation, and the nations cannot endure His threats.

(Jeremiah 10:11) 
Therefore, you shall say to them: "The gods that did not make the universe and the earth will utterly perish from the earth, and from all that is under the universe."

(Jeremiah 10:12) 
He Himself made the earth by His own power. He established the world by His own wisdom, and by His own understanding, He stretched out the celestial bodies of the universe.

(Jeremiah 10:13) 
At the sound of His voice, He brings abundant waters into the sky, and He raises clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash during the turns of the rain, and He brings forth the wind from His storehouses.

(Jeremiah 10:14) 
Every human being has become foolish by their own supposed knowledge. Every artisan is put to shame by his carved idol, because his molten image is a lie, and there is no spirit of life within them.

(Jeremiah 10:15) 
They are worthless, and their work is worthy of ridicule. In the time of their judgment, they will utterly perish.

(Jeremiah 10:16) 
The portion of Jacob is not like these idols. For He who formed all things is the true God, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance. The Lord of Hosts is His name.

(Jeremiah 10:17) 
Gather up your goods from the land, you who live under siege.

(Jeremiah 10:18) 
For this is what the Lord says: "Behold, this time I will hurl out the inhabitants of the land far away, and I will distress them so severely that their wickedness will be revealed."

(Jeremiah 10:19) 
Woe is me because of my brokenness. My wound is becoming severe. And I said, "Truly, I am crushed by this sickness."

(Jeremiah 10:20) 
My tent has been destroyed. All my ropes are broken. My children have gone out from me, and they are no more. There is no one left to spread out my tent or set up my tent coverings.

(Jeremiah 10:21) 
Because the shepherds have acted foolishly. They have not sought the Lord. Therefore, they have not acted wisely, and all their flock is scattered.

(Jeremiah 10:22) 
Listen! A sound of a rumor is coming. A great commotion approaches from the land of the north. Its purpose is to make the cities of Judah a desolate wilderness and a lair for jackals.

(Jeremiah 10:23) 
I know, O Lord, that a human being's way is not his own path to choose. Nor is it for a man to walk and direct his own steps.

(Jeremiah 10:24) 
Correct me, O Lord, but do so with just judgment. Do not correct me in your furious anger, lest you reduce me to nothing.

(Jeremiah 10:25) 
Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, and upon the regions that have not called upon your name. For they have consumed Jacob, and they have devoured and utterly destroyed him. They have laid waste to his homeland and its beauty.

(Jeremiah 11:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 11:2) 
"Listen to the terms of this covenant," the Lord commanded, "and speak them to the men of Judah and to all who live in Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 11:3) 
Then you must tell them: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Cursed is anyone who does not listen to the terms of this covenant, and does not obey them.'"

(Jeremiah 11:4) 
"These are the terms I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of that blazing iron furnace of slavery. I told them: 'Listen to My voice, and do everything I command you. If you do, you will be My people, and I will be your God.'"

(Jeremiah 11:5) 
"I made this covenant so that I would keep the oath I swore to your fathers—that I would give them a land flowing with milk and honey, just as it is this very day." Then I, Jeremiah, answered, saying, "Amen, O Lord!"

(Jeremiah 11:6) 
And the Lord said to me: "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the open places of Jerusalem, saying: 'Listen to the words of this covenant, and obey them.'"

(Jeremiah 11:7) 
"For I solemnly warned your fathers from the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt until this very day. I rose early and repeatedly warned them, saying: 'Listen to My voice!'"

(Jeremiah 11:8) 
"But they would not listen, nor would they pay attention. Instead, each one stubbornly followed the evil desires of their own heart. So, I brought upon them all the curses of this covenant—the very words I commanded them to obey, but which they refused to do."

(Jeremiah 11:9) 
And the Lord said to me: "A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 11:10) 
"They have turned back to the wickedness of their ancestors, who refused to listen to My words. And these people have gone after foreign gods to serve them. The people of Israel and the people of Judah have broken My covenant, the one I made with their fathers."

(Jeremiah 11:11) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "Behold, I am bringing upon them such evils and calamities that they will not be able to escape. When they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them."

(Jeremiah 11:12) 
"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the false gods to whom they offer their libations, but those gods will not be able to save them in their time of affliction."

(Jeremiah 11:13) 
"For you, O Judah, have as many gods as you have cities! And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem, you have set up altars of shame, altars to offer sacrifices to the Baals."

(Jeremiah 11:14) 
"Therefore, Jeremiah, do not pray for this people, nor offer up any praise or prayer on their behalf. For I will not listen when they cry out to Me in their time of affliction."

(Jeremiah 11:15) 
"Why has My beloved nation committed so many wicked deeds right in My own house, the Temple? Will the holy sacrifices you offer cleanse you of your evil deeds? Can these rituals truly turn you away from your sins?"

(Jeremiah 11:16) 
"The Lord once called you a leafy olive tree, beautiful, fruitful, and pleasing. But now, at the sound of a great, roaring storm, He has set its wood on fire, and its branches are burned."

(Jeremiah 11:17) 
"And the Lord of hosts, who first planted you like an olive tree, has declared that disaster will come upon you because of the evils that the people of Israel and the people of Judah brought upon themselves. They provoked Me to wrath by offering sacrifices to the Baals."

(Jeremiah 11:18) 
But You, O Lord, have shown me what is happening, and I have come to know it. You then revealed to me their wicked schemes.

(Jeremiah 11:19) 
I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter, completely unaware that they had devised plots against me. They were saying: "Let us put wood into his bread"—meaning, "Let us destroy him by cutting off his sustenance and strength"—"and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will no longer be remembered."

(Jeremiah 11:20) 
But You, O Lord of hosts, who judge justly and examine the innermost thoughts and hearts of all, let me see Your vengeance upon them. For I have laid my entire case before You.

(Jeremiah 11:21) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your very life and say, "You must not prophesy in the name of the Lord, or you will die by our hands."

(Jeremiah 11:22) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts says: "Behold, I will punish them! Their young men will die by the sword, and their sons and their daughters will die by famine."

(Jeremiah 11:23) 
"And there will be no remnant of them left alive. For I will bring calamity upon the men of Anathoth in the very year of their reckoning and punishment."

(Jeremiah 12:12:1) 
You are righteous, Lord, if I were to contend with You. Yet, I will speak with You concerning justice. Why does the path of the wicked prosper? Why is it well for all who deal treacherously and act wickedly?

(Jeremiah 12:12:2) 
You planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are near to their mouths, but You are far from their inner hearts and consciences.

(Jeremiah 12:12:3) 
But You, Lord, know me; You have seen me and tested my heart concerning You. Gather them together like sheep ready for sacrifice, and set them apart for the day of their slaughter and destruction.

(Jeremiah 12:12:4) 
How long will the earth mourn, and the grass of every field wither, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants? The beasts and the birds have perished, because the wicked have said, 'God will not see what becomes of us in the end.'

(Jeremiah 12:12:5) 
If you have struggled running with footmen, how then will you be able to contend with horses? And if you have felt secure in a land of peace, what will you do when the Jordan overflows its banks?

(Jeremiah 12:12:6) 
For even your brothers and your father’s household, even they have fought against you, and they have cried out loudly after you. Do not believe them, even when they speak pleasant words to you.

(Jeremiah 12:12:7) 
I have forsaken My house, My temple, and My people. I have abandoned My heritage, Israel. I have given My dearly beloved people into the hand of their enemies.

(Jeremiah 12:12:8) 
My heritage has become to Me like a roaring lion in the forest. She has raised her voice against Me, so I have treated her as an enemy.

(Jeremiah 12:12:9) 
Is My heritage to Me like a bird of various colors? Or have dyed birds—foreign invaders—surrounded Me? Come, gather together, all you beasts of the field, hurry to devour her!

(Jeremiah 12:12:10) 
Many shepherds—foreign invaders and their rulers—have destroyed My vineyard. They have trampled My treasured portion of land. They have turned My desirable portion into a desolate wilderness.

(Jeremiah 12:12:11) 
They have laid it utterly waste. The entire land mourns before Me, because there is no one who takes these things to heart or repents.

(Jeremiah 12:12:12) 
Over all the barren pathways, the destroyers have come. For the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other. There is no peace for anyone.

(Jeremiah 12:12:13) 
They have sown wheat, but they have reaped thorns. They will inherit only toil, and it will not profit them. You will be put to shame by your harvest, because of the burning anger of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 12:12:14) 
Thus says the Lord concerning all My evil neighbors who have touched My inheritance—the land which I distributed to My people Israel: Behold, I will uproot them from their own land. And I will pull out the roots of Judah from the midst of those nations.

(Jeremiah 12:12:15) 
And it shall be, after I have uprooted them, I will turn and have compassion on them. I will bring them back, each person to his own inheritance, and each one to his own land.

(Jeremiah 12:12:16) 
And it shall be, if they diligently learn the ways of My people, so that they swear by My Name, saying, 'As the Lord lives'—just as they taught My people to swear by Baal—then they will be built up in the midst of My people.

(Jeremiah 12:12:17) 
But if they do not listen and obey, then I will utterly uproot and destroy that nation, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 13:1) 
The Lord told me this: "Go get yourself a linen loincloth, and put it on your body around your waist. Don't ever wash it in water."

(Jeremiah 13:2) 
So I got the loincloth, just as the Lord had commanded. And I put it on.

(Jeremiah 13:3) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, a second time, saying this:

(Jeremiah 13:4) 
"Take the loincloth you just got, the one you are wearing. Go to the Euphrates River, and hide it there in a crack in the rock."

(Jeremiah 13:5) 
So I went and hid it, just as the Lord had commanded me.

(Jeremiah 13:6) 
After many days passed, the Lord told me: "Go now. Go back to the Euphrates River and get the loincloth, the one I told you to hide there."

(Jeremiah 13:7) 
So I went to the Euphrates. I dug it up and took the loincloth from where I had hidden it. But behold, the loincloth was completely rotted and ruined. It was useless.

(Jeremiah 13:8) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Jeremiah 13:9) 
"The Lord says this: Just like this loincloth, I will cause the pride of Judah to rot away. And I will cause the great pride of Jerusalem to rot away."

(Jeremiah 13:10) 
"This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, and who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts, who have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them—they will become like this loincloth: good for nothing."

(Jeremiah 13:11) 
"Just as a loincloth clings closely to a man's body, so I had bound to Myself all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah," says the Lord. "My intention was for them to be My people, a source of fame, praise, and glory to Me. But they did not listen."

(Jeremiah 13:12) 
"So you shall speak this proverb to them: 'The Lord God of Israel says this: "Every wine jar will be filled with wine." And they will say to you, 'Of course, we know that every wine jar will be filled with wine! What's the point?'"

(Jeremiah 13:13) 
"Then you shall say to them: 'The Lord says this: "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land with a staggering drunkenness. This includes the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."'"

(Jeremiah 13:14) 
"I will scatter them, separating each person from their brother, fathers and sons alike," says the Lord. "I will show no mercy, no pity, and no forgiveness; I will simply destroy them completely."

(Jeremiah 13:15) 
Listen and pay close attention with your ears. Do not be so proud, because the Lord has spoken this warning.

(Jeremiah 13:16) 
Give honor to the Lord your God now, before He causes your feet to stumble on the dark mountains. Before the shadowy mountains darken fully, you will look for light, but behold, it will be the shadow of death instead. And everything will turn into deep gloom.

(Jeremiah 13:17) 
But if you refuse to listen to this warning, my soul will weep in secret over your pride. It will weep bitterly, and my eyes will shed many tears, because the Lord's flock has been led away into captivity.

(Jeremiah 13:18) 
Tell the king and the queen mother: "Humble yourselves and sit in the dust!" "Because your glorious crown has fallen from your heads."

(Jeremiah 13:19) 
The cities of the Negeb, the southern region of Judah, are shut up. No one can get in or out. All of Judah has been exiled, carried away completely.

(Jeremiah 13:20) 
Lift up your eyes and look at those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you? Where are your glorious sheep?

(Jeremiah 13:21) 
What will you say when God punishes you? For you yourself have taught them to be against you, and you have appointed them as rulers over you, like princes over your head. Won't pains seize you, like a woman giving birth?

(Jeremiah 13:22) 
If you say in your heart, 'Why have these terrible things happened to me?' It is because of your many sins that your shameful parts have been exposed. Your garment has been stripped off, and your body left bare.

(Jeremiah 13:23) 
Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin? Or can a leopard change its spots? Then you, who have become so accustomed to doing evil, can also do good.

(Jeremiah 13:24) 
Therefore, I will scatter them like straw, which is blown away by the wind across the desert.

(Jeremiah 13:25) 
"This is your fate, the portion I have allotted to you," says the Lord. "Because you have forgotten Me and have trusted in lies."

(Jeremiah 13:26) 
That is why I Myself have pulled up your skirt to expose your face. And all your public shame has been revealed.

(Jeremiah 13:27) 
"Your spiritual adulteries, the lustful neighing of your horses, the wickedness of your fornication—I have seen your abominations on the hills. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You will not be cleansed. How much longer will you persist in this?"

(Jeremiah 14:1) 
This is the message of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the severe drought conditions.

(Jeremiah 14:2) 
Judah mourned and her city gates collapsed in despair. The people sat on the ground, grieving, and the desperate cries of Jerusalem rose up.

(Jeremiah 14:3) 
The leaders sent their servants to fetch water. They went to draw it, but they found no water. They returned with their empty vessels, feeling ashamed and distressed, covering their heads in despair.

(Jeremiah 14:4) 
Because the land was so desolate, and because no rain fell upon the ground, the farmers were utterly ashamed. They too covered their heads in deep despair.

(Jeremiah 14:5) 
Even the wild deer in the field gave birth and then abandoned its young, because there was no grass for it to feed on.

(Jeremiah 14:6) 
And the wild donkeys stood on the bare rocks, gasping for air like desert beasts. Their eyes grew dim and faint, because there was no grass to be found anywhere.

(Jeremiah 14:7) 
Lord, if our many sins are testifying against us, then for the sake of your holy name, please act! For we have turned away from you so many times, and we have truly sinned against you.

(Jeremiah 14:8) 
You are the true hope of Israel, its only Savior in times of deep distress. Why do you act as if you are a mere stranger in our land, or like a traveler who just stops for the night to rest, with no intention of staying?

(Jeremiah 14:9) 
Why do you seem like a bewildered man, or like a mighty warrior who is powerless to save us? But Lord, you are truly among us, and your holy name has been called upon us. Do not abandon us!

(Jeremiah 14:10) 
This is what the Lord says to this people, who loved to wander away and never settled in His ways. The Lord was not pleased with them. Now, He will remember their many sins, and He will punish their evil deeds.

(Jeremiah 14:11) 
Then the Lord said to me: "Do not pray for this people's well-being."

(Jeremiah 14:12) 
"Even when they fast, I will not listen to their prayers. And if they offer burnt offerings and sacrifices, I will not accept them. For I will utterly consume them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence."

(Jeremiah 14:13) 
And I said, "Oh, oh, oh, Lord God! The prophets themselves are telling them, 'You will not see a sword, nor will there be famine among you. Instead, He will give you true peace in this very place!'"

(Jeremiah 14:14) 
Then the Lord said to me: "The prophets are speaking lies in My name! I did not send them, nor did I command them, nor did I speak to them. They are prophesying to you a deceitful vision, empty divination, every vile thing, and the deceptions that come from their own hearts."

(Jeremiah 14:15) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning those prophets who are prophesying in My name, whom I did not send, and who insist: 'There will be no sword or famine in this land!' Those very prophets will be consumed by the sword and by famine.

(Jeremiah 14:16) 
And the people to whom these prophets lie will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and the sword. There will be no one left to bury them—neither the people themselves, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. Indeed, I will pour out the full consequence of their own evil upon them.

(Jeremiah 14:17) 
And you, Jeremiah, shall say this word to them: "Let my eyes stream with tears day and night without ceasing, because the virgin daughter of my people has been utterly crushed with a great breaking, a very dreadful and grievous wound."

(Jeremiah 14:18) 
"If I go out to the fields, behold, there are those slain by the sword. And if I enter the city, behold, there are those wasted away by famine. Even the prophet and the priest have been led into exile, to a land they do not know."

(Jeremiah 14:19) 
"Have you completely rejected Judah? Has your soul truly abhorred Zion? Why then have you struck us so severely that we cannot be healed? We looked for peace, but no good came; we hoped for a time of healing, but behold, there is only terror!"

(Jeremiah 14:20) 
"We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have truly sinned against you."

(Jeremiah 14:21) 
"Do not give us over to public disgrace for the sake of your holy name. Do not dishonor the glorious throne of your majesty. Remember your covenant with us; do not annul it!"

(Jeremiah 14:22) 
"Can any of the idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies themselves give showers? Are you not the Lord our God, the only one we have waited for? For you alone are the one who has made all these things."

(Jeremiah 15:1) 
And the Lord said to me: "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me interceding, My favor would not be with this people. Send them away from My presence, and let them depart for their judgment."

(Jeremiah 15:2) 
And when they ask you, 'Where shall we go out to?' you shall tell them: 'Thus says the Lord: Those appointed to death, to death they shall go. And those appointed to the sword, to the sword they shall go. And those appointed to famine, to famine they shall go. And those appointed to captivity, to captivity they shall go.'

(Jeremiah 15:3) 
And I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the Lord: the sword to kill, dogs to tear, the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy their corpses.

(Jeremiah 15:4) 
And I will make them an object of horror and shaking to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for all the detestable things he did in Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 15:5) 
For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Or who will mourn for you? Or who will go to pray for your peace and well-being?

(Jeremiah 15:6) 
You have forsaken Me, says the Lord; you have turned your back. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you. I am weary of relenting from judgment.

(Jeremiah 15:7) 
And I will scatter them with a winnowing fork to the very ends of the earth. I will make My people childless and destroy them, for they have not turned back from their wicked ways.

(Jeremiah 15:8) 
Their widows have become more numerous to Me than the sand of the sea. I have brought upon them, even upon the mother of young men, a destroyer at noonday, striking unexpectedly. Suddenly I have brought anguish and terrors upon her, even upon her cities.

(Jeremiah 15:9) 
She who bore seven children has grown weak; she has gasped her last breath. Her sun has set while it was still day, signifying a sudden and premature end to her prosperity. She has been shamed and disgraced. And their remaining ones I will deliver to the sword in the sight of their enemies, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 15:10) 
Woe is me, my mother! Why did you give birth to me, a man of strife, a man of contention to the whole land? I have neither lent money at interest nor borrowed it, so I have no financial disputes. Yet everyone curses me.

(Jeremiah 15:11) 
The Lord said: "Surely I will release you for your own good. Surely I will intercede for you in the time of affliction and in the time of tribulation against your enemy."

(Jeremiah 15:12) 
Can common iron be broken by iron from the north, or common metal by steel? (Meaning, Judah cannot withstand the northern invader).

(Jeremiah 15:13) 
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without payment, because of all your sins and throughout all your borders.

(Jeremiah 15:14) 
And I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths, even to the underworld.

(Jeremiah 15:15) 
You know, O Lord, remember me, and come to my aid, and deliver me from my persecutors. Do not, in Your enduring patience, allow me to be consumed. Know that for Your sake I have suffered scorn and humiliation.

(Jeremiah 15:16) 
Your words were found, and I consumed them. And Your word became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by Your name, O Lord, God of hosts.

(Jeremiah 15:17) 
I did not sit with the assembly of those who mock or make merry, nor did I rejoice in the presence of Your powerful hand upon me. Instead, I sat alone, for You had filled me with Your stern warning of judgment.

(Jeremiah 15:18) 
Why has my pain become perpetual, and my wound incurable and refusing to heal? Have You become to me like a deceitful stream, like waters that fail when most needed and are therefore unfaithful?

(Jeremiah 15:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord: "If you return to Me, I will restore you, and you shall stand before My face. And if you separate the precious from the worthless in your message, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn to you and your message, but you must not turn to them and their ways."

(Jeremiah 15:20) 
And I will make you to this people a strong bronze wall. They will fight against you, but they will not prevail, because I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 15:21) 
And I will deliver you from the hand of evil men, and I will redeem you from the hand of the powerful.

(Jeremiah 16:1) 
And then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 16:2) 
"You shall not take a wife for yourself, and you shall have no sons or daughters in this place."

(Jeremiah 16:3) 
"For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and about their mothers who bore them, and about their fathers who fathered them in this land:"

(Jeremiah 16:4) 
"They will die of terrible diseases; they will not be mourned, nor will they be buried. Their bodies will become like dung spread upon the face of the earth. They will be consumed by sword and by famine. And their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth."

(Jeremiah 16:5) 
"For this is what the Lord says: 'Do not enter a house of feasting, nor go to mourn, nor offer them comfort. For I have taken my peace from all these people,' declares the Lord, 'along with my mercy and my compassion.'"

(Jeremiah 16:6) 
"Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried, nor will they be mourned. No one will cut themselves or shave their heads for them as a sign of grief."

(Jeremiah 16:7) 
"And no one will break bread for them in mourning to comfort them over the dead. No cup of consolation will be given to them for their father or their mother."

(Jeremiah 16:8) 
"You shall not enter a house of feasting to eat and drink with them either."

(Jeremiah 16:9) 
"For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Behold, I will remove from this place, before your very eyes and during your lifetime, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.'"

(Jeremiah 16:10) 
"And when you announce all these words to these people, and they say to you: 'Why has the Lord spoken all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? And what is our sin that we have sinned against the Lord our God?'"

(Jeremiah 16:11) 
"Then you shall say to them: 'Because your fathers abandoned me,' declares the Lord, 'and went after other gods, and served them, and worshiped them. They abandoned me and did not keep my law.'"

(Jeremiah 16:12) 
"But you have acted even worse than your fathers! For behold, each one of you walks according to the stubbornness of your own evil heart, refusing to listen to me."

(Jeremiah 16:13) 
"And I will cast you out from this land into a land which neither you nor your fathers have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, gods who will give you no rest."

(Jeremiah 16:14) 
"Therefore, behold, the days are coming,' declares the Lord, 'when it will no longer be said: "As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt!"'"

(Jeremiah 16:15) 
"But instead: 'As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had cast them!' For I will bring them back into their own land, which I gave to their fathers."

(Jeremiah 16:16) 
"Behold, I will send for many fishermen,' declares the Lord, 'and they will fish them out. And after that, I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down from every mountain and every hill, and out of the crevices of the rocks.'"

(Jeremiah 16:17) 
"For my eyes are upon all their ways. Nothing is hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my sight."

(Jeremiah 16:18) 
"And I will first repay them double for their iniquities and their sins, because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and with their abominations they have filled my inheritance."

(Jeremiah 16:19) 
"O Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of tribulation! To you, the nations will come from the farthest ends of the earth and say: 'Truly, our fathers inherited lies, worthless things that brought them no benefit.'"

(Jeremiah 16:20) 
"Can a man make gods for himself, when they are not truly gods?"

(Jeremiah 16:21) 
"Therefore, behold, I will make them know this time. I will show them my hand and my power, and they will know that my name is the Lord."

(Jeremiah 17:1) 
The sin of Judah has been etched into their very being with an iron stylus and a diamond point. It is engraved upon the tablet of their hearts, and upon the horns of the altars where they offer their sacrifices—a permanent sign of their idolatry.

(Jeremiah 17:2) 
Their own children will remember their altars of false worship and their sacred groves under every green tree, on every high hill where they committed these sins.

(Jeremiah 17:3) 
Your mountains—which are like a wilderness—and your strength, all your treasures, I will give them over to plunder. Your high places, where you committed idolatry, will be given over because of your sins in all your territories.

(Jeremiah 17:4) 
You will be forced to let go of your own inheritance, the land I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, because you have ignited a fire of My anger, and it will burn on and on, unceasingly.

(Jeremiah 17:5) 
The Lord says this: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes his own human strength his confidence, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 17:6) 
For such a man will be like a desert broom bush in the arid wasteland; he will not even perceive when good things come. Instead, he will live in the parched places of the wilderness, in a salt land that is completely uninhabited and barren.

(Jeremiah 17:7) 
Blessed is the man who places his trust in the Lord, and whose total confidence is the Lord Himself.

(Jeremiah 17:8) 
And he will be like a tree that has been planted by flowing waters, sending out its roots by the stream. It will not fear when the summer's intense heat arrives, for its leaves will remain green. In a year of drought, it will not be anxious, nor will it stop producing its fruit.

(Jeremiah 17:9) 
The heart of man is twisted and perverse, and it is inscrutable—who can truly understand or know it fully?

(Jeremiah 17:10) 
I am the Lord, the One who deeply searches the heart and tests the innermost desires and intentions. I give to each person according to the way they live their life, and according to the fruit of their actions.

(Jeremiah 17:11) 
Just like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay, so is the person who gathers riches unjustly, not by righteous means. In the middle of his life, he will be forced to abandon them, and in the end, he will be exposed as a fool.

(Jeremiah 17:12) 
Your glorious throne, exalted from the very beginning of time, is the place where we are made holy by Your presence.

(Jeremiah 17:13) 
O Lord, You are the very hope of Israel! All who abandon You will be put to shame. Those who turn away from You will have their names written in the dust, forgotten and without hope, for they have abandoned the Lord, the true fountain of life-giving waters.

(Jeremiah 17:14) 
Heal me, O Lord, and then I will truly be healed. Save me, and then I will truly be saved, because You are the one I praise.

(Jeremiah 17:15) 
Look! These people say to me, "Where is the word of the Lord you speak of? Let it come to pass, if it is real!"

(Jeremiah 17:16) 
But I have not fled from being a shepherd, following You. I have not desired the day of human calamity, as You well know. What came out of my lips was always spoken correctly and truthfully in Your sight.

(Jeremiah 17:17) 
Do not become a terror to me; You are my strength in the day when I face affliction.

(Jeremiah 17:18) 
Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but let me not be shamed. Let them be terrified, but let me not be terrified. Bring upon them a day of calamity, and crush them with a double, overwhelming destruction.

(Jeremiah 18:1) 
The Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 18:2) 
"Go down to the potter’s house, and there you will hear My words."

(Jeremiah 18:3) 
So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working on his wheel.

(Jeremiah 18:4) 
But the vessel that the potter was shaping from clay with his hands was ruined. So he changed his mind and made another vessel, just as it seemed good to him, the potter, to do.

(Jeremiah 18:5) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 18:6) 
"Can I not deal with you, O house of Israel, as this potter deals with his clay?" says the Lord. "Behold, just as the clay is entirely in the hand of the potter, so are you entirely in My hand, O house of Israel."

(Jeremiah 18:7) 
"If I pronounce a judgment against a nation or against a kingdom—meaning I will uproot it, pull it down, and destroy it—"

(Jeremiah 18:8) 
"—if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns away from its evil, then I will change My mind concerning the evil I had planned to bring upon it."

(Jeremiah 18:9) 
"And if I pronounce a blessing upon a nation or upon a kingdom—meaning I will build it up and plant it—"

(Jeremiah 18:10) 
"—and that nation does evil in My sight, refusing to obey My voice, then I will change My mind concerning the good I had promised to do for it."

(Jeremiah 18:11) 
Now then, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: "Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am now forming a disaster against you and devising a plan to bring it upon you. Therefore, let each one of you turn away from your evil path, and correct your ways and your actions."

(Jeremiah 18:12) 
But they replied: "That is hopeless! We will go our own way, and each of us will act according to the stubborn wickedness of his own heart."

(Jeremiah 18:13) 
Therefore, the Lord says this: "Ask the other nations: who has ever heard of such a horrifying thing—this betrayal that the virgin Israel, My once-pure people, has committed?"

(Jeremiah 18:14) 
"Does the snow on the rocks of Lebanon ever melt away completely? Do the cold, gushing waters that flow from the mountains ever dry up?"

(Jeremiah 18:15) 
"Yet My people have forgotten Me; they offer sacrifices to worthless idols. They have stumbled in their ways, straying from the ancient paths that lead to life, choosing instead to walk on unpaved byways—a path that is not meant for public, righteous use—"

(Jeremiah 18:16) 
"—resulting in their land becoming a desolation, a perpetual object of scorn and horror. Everyone who passes by it will be utterly appalled and will shake their head in disbelief."

(Jeremiah 18:17) 
"Like a scorching desert wind, I will scatter them before their enemy. I will show them My back and not My face—meaning I will abandon them and not help them—on the day of their destruction."

(Jeremiah 18:18) 
Then they said: "Come, let us devise plots against Jeremiah. For we have our own priests who teach the Law, our own wise men who give counsel, and our own prophets who speak the word of God—we don't need *him*. Come, let us attack him with our tongues through false accusations and slander, and let us ignore everything he says."

(Jeremiah 18:19) 
Lord, pay attention to me, and hear the voice of my adversaries.

(Jeremiah 18:20) 
Is evil to be repaid for good? For they have dug a pit to trap me and take my life. Remember how I stood before You to intercede for them, to speak good on their behalf, and to turn Your indignation away from them.

(Jeremiah 18:21) 
Therefore, hand their children over to famine, and deliver them to the power of the sword. Let their wives become childless and widows. Let their men be slain by death, and their young men be run through by the sword in battle.

(Jeremiah 18:22) 
Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You suddenly bring a band of marauders upon them. For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.

(Jeremiah 18:23) 
But You, O Lord, know all of their plots against me, even those meant to bring about my death. Do not forgive their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from Your sight. Let them be cast down before You; in the time of Your wrath, let them be struck down.

(Jeremiah 19:1) 
The Lord says this: "Go and buy yourself an earthenware flask from a potter. Then take some of the elders of the people and some of the elder priests with you,

(Jeremiah 19:2) 
and go out to the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, which is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There you will proclaim the words that I will speak to you.

(Jeremiah 19:3) 
And you shall say: 'Hear the word of the Lord, kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: Behold, I am bringing such a disaster upon this place that everyone who hears of it will have their ears ring with horror and shock.

(Jeremiah 19:4) 
This is because they have abandoned Me and have made this sacred place foreign and profane by sacrificing in it to foreign gods—gods unknown to them, their fathers, or the kings of Judah. They have also filled this place with the blood of innocent people.

(Jeremiah 19:5) 
They have built high places for Baal to burn their sons with fire as offerings to Baal—a practice I never commanded, never spoke of, and one that never even entered My mind.

(Jeremiah 19:6) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but instead, the Valley of Slaughter.

(Jeremiah 19:7) 
In this very place, I will shatter the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek to take their lives. I will also make their dead bodies food for the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth.

(Jeremiah 19:8) 
I will make this city a desolate waste and an object of scornful whistling. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will whistle in derision at all its wounds and devastation.

(Jeremiah 19:9) 
I will make them eat the flesh of their own sons and the flesh of their own daughters. Each person will eat the flesh of their neighbor during the siege and in the desperate distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives will confine them.

(Jeremiah 19:10) 
Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who have gone with you.

(Jeremiah 19:11) 
And you shall say to them: 'The Lord of hosts says this: Just so will I shatter this people and this city, like a potter's vessel that is broken beyond repair. They will be buried in Topheth because there will be no other place left to bury them.'

(Jeremiah 19:12) 
So will I do to this place, says the Lord, and to its inhabitants. I will make this city like Topheth itself.

(Jeremiah 19:13) 
The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become as unclean as the place of Topheth. This is because in all the houses, on whose rooftops they sacrificed to all the host of heaven—the astral deities—and poured out drink offerings to foreign gods, they have been defiled.

(Jeremiah 19:14) 
Then Jeremiah came back from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of the house of the Lord and spoke to all the people.

(Jeremiah 19:15) 
The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: 'Behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns every disaster that I have spoken against it. This is because they have stubbornly hardened their necks, refusing to listen to My words.'

(Jeremiah 20:1) 
Pashhur, the son of Immer, a priest who was appointed as the chief officer in the Temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah speaking these prophetic words.

(Jeremiah 20:2) 
So Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and then put him in stocks, which were located at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the Temple of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 20:3) 
The next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks. Jeremiah then said to him, "The Lord will no longer call you Pashhur; instead, He will call you Magor-Missabib"—meaning 'Terror on Every Side.'

(Jeremiah 20:4) 
For thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and you will witness it with your own eyes. I will also give all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them off to Babylon and strike them down with the sword.'

(Jeremiah 20:5) 
'And I will give all the wealth of this city, all its resources, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hands of their enemies. They will plunder them, take them away, and carry them off to Babylon.'

(Jeremiah 20:6) 
'And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried—you and all your friends, to whom you prophesied lies.'

(Jeremiah 20:7) 
Jeremiah then spoke to the Lord, saying, "You drew me in, O Lord, and I was drawn in to serve You. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed over me. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me."

(Jeremiah 20:8) 
"For whenever I speak, I must cry out about violence and devastation; I announce it continually. So the word of the Lord has become a constant source of reproach and mockery for me, all day long."

(Jeremiah 20:9) 
"But if I say, 'I will not remember Him, nor speak anymore in His Name,' then His word becomes in my heart like a burning fire, shut up in my bones. I become weary of holding it in, and I cannot endure it."

(Jeremiah 20:10) 
"For I hear the whisperings of many, and terror is on every side. They say, 'Denounce him! Let's denounce him!' All my former friends, who once watched my side, now wait for me to be deceived so they can catch me and take revenge."

(Jeremiah 20:11) 
"But the Lord is with me like a powerful warrior. Therefore, those who persecute me will stumble and will not prevail. They will be greatly ashamed, for they have failed to act wisely. Their disgrace will be eternal; it will never be forgotten."

(Jeremiah 20:12) 
"O Lord of hosts, You are the one who tests the righteous and sees into the depths of their minds and hearts. I beg You, let me see Your vengeance upon them, for I have entrusted my cause to You alone."

(Jeremiah 20:13) 
"Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor and oppressed from the hand of the wicked and malicious."

(Jeremiah 20:14) 
"Cursed be the day on which I was born! May the day my mother bore me never be blessed!"

(Jeremiah 20:15) 
"Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, 'A male child is born to you!'—and thereby filled him with great joy."

(Jeremiah 20:16) 
"May that man become like the cities that the Lord overthrew without remorse or a change of heart! May he hear screams in the morning and wailing at noon!"

(Jeremiah 20:17) 
"Why did he not kill me while still in the womb, so that my mother's womb might have been my grave, and her womb an eternal conception?"

(Jeremiah 20:18) 
"Why did I come out of the womb at all, only to see trouble and sorrow, and to have my days consumed in confusion and shame?"

(Jeremiah 21:1) 
The Lord sent a message to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur, son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to him, with a question for the prophet.

(Jeremiah 21:2) 
"Please ask the Lord for us, because Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, is fighting a war against us. We hope that the Lord might perform all His miracles as He has in the past, and make Nebuchadnezzar retreat from us."

(Jeremiah 21:3) 
And Jeremiah said to them, "You will tell King Zedekiah this:

(Jeremiah 21:4) 
'The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: "Listen, I am going to turn against you the very weapons of war that are in your hands—the weapons you are using to fight the King of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside your city walls. I will then gather these besieging forces into the very heart of this city.

(Jeremiah 21:5) 
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm. I will fight with righteous anger, with indignation, and with great fury.

(Jeremiah 21:6) 
I will strike down the inhabitants of this city—both people and their animals—and they will die from a terrible plague.

(Jeremiah 21:7) 
'After these things,' says the Lord, 'I will give Zedekiah, the King of Judah, along with his servants and his people—including anyone in this city who survives the plague, famine, and the sword—into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon. I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies, those who seek to take their lives. Nebuchadnezzar will strike them down without mercy, without sparing anyone, and without ceasing.'"

(Jeremiah 21:8) 
And to this people you are to say: 'The Lord says this: "Listen, I am now setting before you the path to life and the path to death.

(Jeremiah 21:9) 
Anyone who stays inside this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague. But anyone who goes out and deserts to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live. His life will be snatched away from danger, a bare escape, but he will live."

(Jeremiah 21:10) 
For I have set My face against this city for its destruction, not for its well-being,' says the Lord. 'It will be handed over to the King of Babylon, and he will burn it down with fire.'"

(Jeremiah 21:11) 
And regarding the house of the King of Judah, hear the word of the Lord:

(Jeremiah 21:12) 
'O house of David,' the Lord says this: 'Administer justice diligently and rescue the one who is oppressed from the hand of his accuser. Do this quickly, lest My indignation burst out like fire, consuming everything, and there be no one to extinguish it, because of the wickedness of your actions.

(Jeremiah 21:13) 
Listen, I am coming against you, O inhabitant of the valley—you who call yourself 'the rock of the plain,'” says the Lord. "You who say, 'Who can strike us down? Who can enter into our fortified homes?'"

(Jeremiah 21:14) 
'But I will punish you according to the consequences of your deeds,' says the Lord. 'And I will set fire to its dense forest—referring to the city and its inhabitants—and it will consume everything all around it.'"

(Jeremiah 22:1) 
The Lord God says this: 'Go down to the royal palace of the king of Judah, and speak this message there:''

(Jeremiah 22:2) 
'Say: "Listen to the message from the Lord God, O King of Judah, you who sit on the throne of King David, you and your royal officials, and all your people who come through these city gates."

(Jeremiah 22:3) 
The Lord God says: 'Do what is right and just. Rescue those who are robbed or unjustly oppressed from the power of their oppressors. Do not harm or oppress the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow. And do not shed innocent blood in this place.'

(Jeremiah 22:4) 
For if you faithfully carry out this command, then kings from the royal line of David will continue to enter through the gates of this palace. They will sit on David's throne, riding in chariots and on horses, along with their royal officials and all their people.

(Jeremiah 22:5) 
But if you do not listen to these words, the Lord God says: 'I have sworn by Myself that this royal palace will become a heap of ruins, utterly deserted.'

(Jeremiah 22:6) 
For the Lord God says this concerning the royal palace of the king of Judah: 'Even though you are as glorious to Me as the forested heights of Gilead or the majestic cedars of Lebanon—regions known for their splendor—I solemnly declare that I will turn you into a desolate wasteland, with cities left uninhabited.'

(Jeremiah 22:7) 
I will consecrate destroyers against you—each man with his weapons. They will cut down your choicest cedar timbers, and they will throw them into the fire.

(Jeremiah 22:8) 
Many foreign nations will pass by this city, and each one will ask his neighbor: 'Why has the Lord God done this to such a magnificent city?'

(Jeremiah 22:9) 
And the answer will be: 'Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord their God. They worshipped other foreign gods and served them instead of God.'

(Jeremiah 22:10) 
Do not weep for King Josiah, who has died naturally, nor mourn him too excessively. Instead, weep for King Shallum (Jehoahaz), who is being led away into exile. For he will never return to this land, nor will he ever see the land of his birth again.

(Jeremiah 22:11) 
For the Lord God says this concerning Shallum (also called Jehoahaz), the son of Josiah, King of Judah—he who reigned in place of his father Josiah, and who has departed from this place: 'He will never return here again.'

(Jeremiah 22:12) 
Instead, in the very place to which they have taken him captive, there he will die, and he will never see the land of his birth again.

(Jeremiah 22:13) 
Woe to the king who builds his royal palace through injustice, and his luxurious upper rooms without any regard for justice! He forces his neighbors to work for him for nothing, and he does not pay them for their labor.

(Jeremiah 22:14) 
Woe to the king who says: 'I will build myself a grand and spacious palace, with vast upper rooms!' He then makes its windows wide, and panels its ceilings with expensive cedar wood, and paints it with bright, lavish colors.

(Jeremiah 22:15) 
Do you truly believe you are a king merely because you outdo others in building with cedar? Did not your father, Josiah, eat and drink and enjoy life? Yet he also practiced justice and righteousness, and because of this, everything went well for him.

(Jeremiah 22:16) 
He defended the cause of the poor and the needy, ensuring they received justice, as if it were his own cause. Is this not truly what it means to know Me? declares the Lord God.

(Jeremiah 22:17) 
But your eyes and your heart are set on nothing but your own greed, on shedding innocent blood, on practicing oppression, and on committing constant injustice.

(Jeremiah 22:18) 
Therefore, the Lord God says this concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: 'No one will mourn him by saying, "Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!" No one will lament for him by crying, "Alas, my lord! Alas, his majesty!"'

(Jeremiah 22:19) 
He will be buried with the disgraceful burial of a donkey—his corpse will be dragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 22:20) 
O Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon and cry out! Raise your voice in Bashan! Call out from the heights of Abarim! For all your political allies have been shattered and destroyed.

(Jeremiah 22:21) 
I spoke to you when you were prosperous, but you defiantly said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your persistent way from your earliest youth, because you have never listened to My voice.

(Jeremiah 22:22) 
All your leaders will be swept away by the wind, scattered and destroyed. And your allies will be led into captivity. Then you will be shamed and utterly disgraced because of all your wickedness.

(Jeremiah 22:23) 
You who live in your cedar-paneled palaces, as if nesting securely among the majestic cedars of Lebanon—how terribly you will groan when the pains of judgment come upon you, pains like those of a woman in childbirth!

(Jeremiah 22:24) 
As surely as I live, declares the Lord God, even if Coniah (also called Jehoiachin), the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a cherished signet ring on My right hand, I would still tear you from it.

(Jeremiah 22:25) 
I will give you into the power of those who seek to kill you, into the power of those whose faces you dread: into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the power of the Chaldeans.

(Jeremiah 22:26) 
I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into a foreign land, a land where neither of you were born, and there you will both die.

(Jeremiah 22:27) 
And to the land to which they so deeply long to return, they will never come back.

(Jeremiah 22:28) 
Is this man Coniah just a despised and broken clay pot? Is he a vessel no longer fit for any use? Why are he and his offspring cast out and thrown into a land they have never known?

(Jeremiah 22:29) 
O land, O land, O land—listen closely to the message of the Lord God!

(Jeremiah 22:30) 
The Lord God says this: 'Record this man Coniah as childless, meaning he will have no royal heir. He is a man who will not prosper in his lifetime. For none of his descendants will ever sit on the throne of David, nor will any ever again rule with authority in Judah.'

(Jeremiah 23:1) 
“Woe to the shepherds who scatter and tear apart the flock of My pasture!” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:2) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Israel says to the shepherds who are supposed to feed My people: ‘You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and you have failed to care for them properly. So now, behold, I Myself will punish you for the evil of your actions and intentions,’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:3) 
“And I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands to which I have driven them away; and I will bring them back to their own pastures, and they will become fruitful and multiply.”

(Jeremiah 23:4) 
“And I will raise up new, good shepherds over them, and these shepherds will truly feed them. My flock will no longer be afraid or terrified, and not one of them will be missing from their number,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:5) 
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch—this will be a King who will reign, and He will be wise. He will execute justice and righteousness throughout the entire land.”

(Jeremiah 23:6) 
“In those days, Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in security. And this is the name by which they will call Him: ‘The Lord Our Righteousness.’”

(Jeremiah 23:7) 
“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when people will no longer swear by saying, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel up from the land of Egypt!’”

(Jeremiah 23:8) 
“...but rather, they will say, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up and brought in the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the other lands to which I had driven them!’ And they shall dwell securely in their own land.”

(Jeremiah 23:9) 
Regarding the false prophets, Jeremiah laments: “My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man completely overcome by wine, because of the Lord and the sheer weight of His holy words.”

(Jeremiah 23:10) 
“For the land is filled with adulterers—those unfaithful to God. Because of God’s curse, the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. The course of their actions has become evil, and the strength of their deeds is not righteous.”

(Jeremiah 23:11) 
“For both prophet and priest have become defiled. Even in My own Temple, I have found their wickedness,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:12) 
“Therefore, their path will be like slippery ground in the deep darkness. They will be driven on and stumble headlong into it. For I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment and reckoning,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:13) 
“Among the prophets of Samaria, I saw something truly disgusting: they prophesied by the pagan god Baal and led My people Israel astray.”

(Jeremiah 23:14) 
“But among the prophets of Jerusalem, I have seen an even more shocking and appalling thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from their wickedness. To Me, all of them have become like Sodom, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”

(Jeremiah 23:15) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord of armies says concerning these prophets: ‘Behold, I will feed them bitter wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. For from the prophets of Jerusalem, a defilement has spread throughout the entire land.’”

(Jeremiah 23:16) 
“This is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you and deceiving you. They speak only the vision of their own deceitful hearts, and not a single word from the mouth of the Lord Himself.’”

(Jeremiah 23:17) 
“They say to those who blaspheme Me, ‘The Lord has spoken: “Peace will be to you.”’ And to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of their own heart, they have falsely declared, ‘No evil will come upon you.’”

(Jeremiah 23:18) 
“For who among them has truly stood in the private council of the Lord, so that he has genuinely seen and heard His word? Who has truly paid attention to His word and heard it?”

(Jeremiah 23:19) 
“Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord! His fury has gone forth like a powerful tempest, and it has fallen directly upon the heads of the wicked!”

(Jeremiah 23:20) 
“The fury of the Lord will not turn back until He has fully executed and completely accomplished the plans of His heart. In the final days, you will understand His purpose clearly.”

(Jeremiah 23:21) 
“I did not send these false prophets, yet they ran on their own initiative. I did not speak to them, yet they still prophesied.”

(Jeremiah 23:22) 
“If they had truly stood in My divine council, they would have certainly heard My words, and then they would have turned My people from their evil ways and from the wickedness of their deeds.”

(Jeremiah 23:23) 
“‘Am I a God who is only near at hand?’ declares the Lord. ‘And not a God who is also far off?’”

(Jeremiah 23:24) 
“‘If a man hides himself in secret places, will I not see him?’ declares the Lord. ‘Do I not fill the entire universe and the earth?’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:25) 
“I have heard what these prophets say, prophesying lies in My name and constantly declaring, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’”

(Jeremiah 23:26) 
“How long will this persist in the hearts of these prophets who prophesy lies—these prophets who speak only the deceptions of their own hearts?”

(Jeremiah 23:27) 
“These are the prophets who intend to make My people forget My name through the false dreams that each one tells to his neighbor, just as their fathers forgot My name because of the pagan god Baal.”

(Jeremiah 23:28) 
“Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream for what it truly is. But let him who has My true word speak My word faithfully and truthfully! What does worthless chaff have in common with nourishing wheat?” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:29) 
“‘Is not My word like a consuming fire?’ declares the Lord. ‘And like a mighty hammer that shatters rock?’”

(Jeremiah 23:30) 
“Therefore, behold, I am against these prophets,” declares the Lord, “who steal My words, each one from his neighbor, claiming them as their own!”

(Jeremiah 23:31) 
“Behold, I am against these prophets,” declares the Lord, “who use their own tongues to speak and then falsely declare, ‘Thus says the Lord!’”

(Jeremiah 23:32) 
“Behold, I am against these prophets of lying dreams,” declares the Lord, “who have recounted them and have deceived My people with their lies and with their empty, baseless claims. I did not send them, nor did I command them, and they are of absolutely no benefit to this people,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:33) 
“Therefore, if this people, or a prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the “burden” of the Lord?’—that is, the prophetic word or oracle—then you shall say to them: ‘You yourselves are the burden! And I will cast you off completely,’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:34) 
“And as for the prophet, or priest, or anyone among the people who still mockingly says, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ I will severely punish that person and his household.”

(Jeremiah 23:35) 
“Instead, this is what you should say, each one to his neighbor and to his brother: ‘What answer has the Lord given?’ and ‘What has the Lord truly spoken?’”

(Jeremiah 23:36) 
“And the phrase ‘the burden of the Lord’ you shall mention no more, because each man’s own careless words will become his actual burden. For you are perverting the true words of the living God, the Lord of armies, our God!”

(Jeremiah 23:37) 
“This is what you should say to the prophet: ‘What answer has the Lord given you?’ and ‘What has the Lord truly spoken?’”

(Jeremiah 23:38) 
“But if you persist in saying, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ because you have said this very phrase—‘The burden of the Lord’—even after I specifically commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not say, “The burden of the Lord!”’—”

(Jeremiah 23:39) 
“Therefore, behold, I Myself will surely take you up and throw you away—remove you entirely from My presence—along with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers.”

(Jeremiah 23:40) 
“And I will inflict upon you an everlasting reproach and an everlasting disgrace, which will never be erased from memory.”

(Jeremiah 24:1) 
The Lord showed me a vision: and behold, there were two baskets of figs placed directly before the Lord's temple. This vision came after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had already carried away Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, who was the king of Judah, along with his princes, the craftsmen, and the smiths from Jerusalem, bringing them as captives to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 24:2) 
One basket contained figs that were exceedingly good, like the very first figs to ripen in the season. The other basket contained figs that were exceedingly bad, so rotten they could not possibly be eaten.

(Jeremiah 24:3) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I answered, "I see figs: the good figs are very, very good; and the bad figs are very, very bad, so rotten that they cannot be eaten."

(Jeremiah 24:4) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 24:5) 
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Just as these good figs represent something positive, so I will look with favor upon the exiles of Judah whom I have sent from this place—from their homeland, into the land of the Chaldeans—for their ultimate good."

(Jeremiah 24:6) 
"And I will fix My gaze upon them for their well-being and favor, and I will bring them back to this land of Judah. I will build them up, and I will not tear them down; I will plant them firmly, and I will not uproot them."

(Jeremiah 24:7) 
"And I will give them a transformed heart, a spiritual capacity to know Me truly—to understand that I am the Lord. Then they will truly be My people, and I will be their God, because they will turn back to Me with a single, undivided heart."

(Jeremiah 24:8) 
"And as for the very bad figs, the ones so rotten that they cannot be eaten—thus says the Lord: So will I treat Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his princes, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who remained in this land, and those who chose to live in the land of Egypt instead of going into exile."

(Jeremiah 24:9) 
"I will make them a source of trouble and distress for all the kingdoms of the earth. They will become a scandal and a byword, a proverb and a curse in all the places to which I will drive them away."

(Jeremiah 24:10) 
"And I will send upon them the sword, and famine, and plague, until they are completely consumed and swept away from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors."

(Jeremiah 25:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah—that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 25:2) 
The prophet Jeremiah spoke this message to all the people of Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem, saying:

(Jeremiah 25:3) 
From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, until this very day—which is now the twenty-third year—the word of the Lord has come to me. I have spoken to you persistently, rising early each morning to speak, but you have not listened.

(Jeremiah 25:4) 
Furthermore, the Lord has sent all His servants, the prophets, to you, rising early and sending them repeatedly. Yet, you have not listened, nor have you inclined your ear to hear them.

(Jeremiah 25:5) 
Their message was always: 'Turn back, each one of you, from your evil way and from your wicked thoughts. Then you will live in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers, for all generations, forever.'

(Jeremiah 25:6) 
They also said: 'Do not follow other gods to serve them or worship them. Do not provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, and then I will not afflict you.'

(Jeremiah 25:7) 
But you did not listen to Me, says the Lord. Instead, you provoked Me to wrath with the works of your hands, bringing harm upon yourselves.

(Jeremiah 25:8) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Because you have not listened to My words—'

(Jeremiah 25:9) 
Behold, I will send for and gather all the tribes from the north,' says the Lord. 'I will send for Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, My servant, and I will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants, and against all the nations that surround it. I will utterly destroy them and make them an object of horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.'

(Jeremiah 25:10) 
'I will take away from them the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstone grinding grain, and the light of the lamp that shines.'

(Jeremiah 25:11) 
'And all this land will become a desolation and an object of horror. These nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.'

(Jeremiah 25:12) 
'When the seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' says the Lord, 'for their iniquity. I will also punish the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.'

(Jeremiah 25:13) 
'I will bring upon that land all My words that I have spoken against it—everything that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.'

(Jeremiah 25:14) 
'For many nations and great kings have subjugated them. I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.'

(Jeremiah 25:15) 
For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Take this cup of the wine of My wrath from My hand and make all the nations, to whom I send you, drink from it.'

(Jeremiah 25:16) 
'They will drink and stagger and act madly because of the sword that I will send among them.'

(Jeremiah 25:17) 
So I took the cup from the hand of the Lord and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it.

(Jeremiah 25:18) 
This included Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an object of horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day.

(Jeremiah 25:19) 
I also made Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people drink.

(Jeremiah 25:20) 
And all the mixed peoples, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines—including Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod—all drank.

(Jeremiah 25:21) 
Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:22) 
All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands across the sea also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:23) 
Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and all who shave the corners of their hair, drank too.

(Jeremiah 25:24) 
All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed peoples who live in the desert also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:25) 
All the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:26) 
All the kings of the north, near and far, one against another, and all the kingdoms of the earth that are on the face of the universe drank. And the king of Sheshach—that is, Babylon—will drink after them all.

(Jeremiah 25:27) 
Then you will say to them: 'This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, vomit, fall, and do not rise again because of the sword that I will send among you.'

(Jeremiah 25:28) 
If they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them: 'This is what the Lord of Hosts says: You shall surely drink!'

(Jeremiah 25:29) 
'For behold, I am beginning to bring affliction on the city where My Name is invoked—Jerusalem. And do you think you, as if innocent, will be delivered from misfortune? No, you will not be delivered! For I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,' says the Lord of Hosts.

(Jeremiah 25:30) 
Therefore, you are to prophesy all these words to them and say to them: 'The Lord will roar from on high; He will utter His voice from His holy dwelling. He will roar mightily over His habitation. With a shout like those treading the winepress, He will cry out against all the inhabitants of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:31) 
'The sound will reach to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has a controversy with the nations. He has a case against all flesh. He will deliver the wicked to the sword,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 25:32) 
This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Behold, disaster will go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm will arise from the farthest ends of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:33) 
'And those slain by the Lord on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; they will lie as dung on the surface of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:34) 
Wail, you shepherds, and cry out! Roll in the dust, you chiefs of the flock! For your days are fulfilled for you to be slaughtered, and I will scatter you, and you will fall like precious vessels broken into pieces.

(Jeremiah 25:35) 
Escape will perish from the shepherds, and salvation from the chiefs of the flock.

(Jeremiah 25:36) 
A sound of crying from the shepherds, and a howling from the chiefs of the flock, because the Lord has devastated their pastures.

(Jeremiah 25:37) 
The fields of peace have been silenced because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 25:38) 
He has left His lair like a lion. Indeed, their land has become a desolation because of the fierceness of the oppressor's wrath, and because of the fierceness of His burning anger.

(Jeremiah 26:26:1) 
In the early days of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, King of Judah, this message came from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 26:26:2) 
Thus says the Lord: Stand in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and speak to all the cities of Judah who come to worship in the Lord’s house. Tell them all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them, and do not hold back a single word.

(Jeremiah 26:26:3) 
Perhaps they will listen to my words and turn back, each person from their wicked way of life. If they do, then I will relent and not bring the disaster I intend for them, which I planned because of the evil of their deeds.

(Jeremiah 26:26:4) 
You shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: If you do not listen to Me and walk in My law which I have given to you—

(Jeremiah 26:26:5) 
and if you do not listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you repeatedly, rising up early to send them, but you have not heeded them—

(Jeremiah 26:26:6) 
then I will make this house (the Temple) like Shiloh (a place of past destruction), and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

(Jeremiah 26:26:7) 
The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the Lord’s house.

(Jeremiah 26:26:8) 
When Jeremiah had finished speaking everything the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, shouting, “You must surely die!”

(Jeremiah 26:26:9) 
They demanded, “Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying that this house (the Temple) will become like Shiloh, and that this city will be made desolate, without an inhabitant?” And all the people gathered together against Jeremiah in the Lord’s house.

(Jeremiah 26:26:10) 
When the princes of Judah heard these words, they came up from the king’s house to the Lord’s house and sat down at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord’s house to hear the matter.

(Jeremiah 26:26:11) 
And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, declaring, “This man deserves a sentence of death! For he has prophesied against this city, just as you have heard with your own ears.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:12) 
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “The Lord sent me on a mission to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:13) 
Now therefore, make your ways good and amend your deeds. Obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will relent from the disaster that He has spoken against you.

(Jeremiah 26:26:14) 
But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me whatever seems good and right in your eyes.

(Jeremiah 26:26:15) 
Nevertheless, know and understand this: if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants. For truly, the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.

(Jeremiah 26:26:16) 
Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:17) 
And some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:

(Jeremiah 26:26:18) 
“Micah the Morasthite was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He said to all the people of Judah, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the Temple shall be like the wooded high places.’

(Jeremiah 26:26:19) 
Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah put him to death for this prophecy? No! Instead, he feared the Lord and entreated the favor of the Lord, and the Lord relented from the disaster which He had spoken against them. And we ourselves are about to do great harm to our own souls by seeking to kill this prophet.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:20) 
There was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 26:26:21) 
But when King Jehoiakim, and all his mighty men, and all the princes heard these words, the king sought to put him to death. When Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and he fled and went into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 26:26:22) 
Then King Jehoiakim sent men into Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and other men with him into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 26:26:23) 
And they brought Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. The king then struck him down with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial ground of the common people.

(Jeremiah 26:26:24) 
Nevertheless, the hand of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, was with Jeremiah, so that he was not delivered into the hands of the people to be put to death. Ahikam’s influence protected Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 27:1) 
It was in the beginning of the reign of Joakim, the son of Josiah, who was the king of Judah, that this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 27:2) 
The Lord said to me: "Make yourself literal chains and a wooden yoke, and then put them on your own neck." This was to be a visible sign of a coming servitude.

(Jeremiah 27:3) 
Then send these chains and this yoke to the kings of Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and Tyre, and Sidon. Send them through the hand of the messengers who are coming to Jerusalem, to King Zedekiah of Judah, probably for a council of alliance.

(Jeremiah 27:4) 
You shall command these messengers to say to their rulers: "This is what the Lord of all creation, the God of Israel, says. This is what you must tell your own rulers:"

(Jeremiah 27:5) 
"It was I who made the earth, and its people, and all the animals on the face of the earth, by my great strength and with my powerful outstretched arm. And I have given this earth to whomever I choose to give it to, to rule over."

(Jeremiah 27:6) 
"And now, I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, who is my appointed servant. Moreover, I have also given him the wild animals of the field, so that they too will serve him."

(Jeremiah 27:7) 
"All nations will serve him, and his son, and his grandson. They will serve him until the appointed time comes for his own land and for himself. Many nations and great kings will serve him."

(Jeremiah 27:8) 
"But any nation or kingdom that will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation. I will visit them with the sword, and with famine, and with plague,' says the Lord, 'until I have completely destroyed them by his hand.'"

(Jeremiah 27:9) 
"Therefore, do not listen to your false prophets, nor your diviners, nor your dreamers, nor your soothsayers, nor your sorcerers, who speak to you saying: 'You will not serve the king of Babylon!'"

(Jeremiah 27:10) 
"For they are prophesying a lie to you. Their goal is to make you be removed far from your own land, so that I may cast you out, and you may utterly perish."

(Jeremiah 27:11) 
"However, the nation that *does* put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him—I will leave that nation in its own land,' says the Lord, 'and its people will be able to cultivate it and live in it peacefully.'"

(Jeremiah 27:12) 
I also spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah according to all these same words, saying: "Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Serve him and his people, and you will live."

(Jeremiah 27:13) 
Why should you and your people die by the sword, and by famine, and by plague, just as the Lord has spoken against any nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon? Do not bring this destruction upon yourselves.

(Jeremiah 27:14) 
Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you: 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' because they are speaking a complete lie to you.

(Jeremiah 27:15) 
"For I have not sent them," says the Lord. "And they are prophesying falsely in my name, so that I may cast you out, and both you and your prophets who prophesy to you may perish."

(Jeremiah 27:16) 
I also spoke to the priests and to this people, saying: "This is what the Lord says: 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you, saying: "Behold, the sacred vessels of the Lord will quickly be brought back from Babylon now!" because they are prophesying a lie to you.'"

(Jeremiah 27:17) 
"Do not listen to them! Instead, serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. For why should this city become a desolate ruin?"

(Jeremiah 27:18) 
"But if they truly are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is truly in them, then let them now make supplication to the Lord of all creation! Let them pray that the vessels which are still left in the House of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, may not also be carried off to Babylon."

(Jeremiah 27:19) 
For this is what the Lord of all creation says concerning the great pillars, and concerning the large bronze basin called 'the Sea,' and concerning the bases that supported the lavers, and concerning the rest of the vessels that still remain in this city.

(Jeremiah 27:20) 
These are the items that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did not take when he carried away Jeconiah, the son of Joakim, who was the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 27:21) 
Indeed, this is what the Lord of all creation, the God of Israel, says concerning those vessels that are still left in the House of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:

(Jeremiah 27:22) 
"They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will remain until the day I intervene and visit them," says the Lord. "Then I will cause them to be brought back from Babylon and fully restored to this holy place."

(Jeremiah 28:1) 
It came to pass in that year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, specifically in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azur, a prophet from Gibeon, came to me, Jeremiah, in the Temple of the Lord, speaking before the priests and all the people.

(Jeremiah 28:2) 
Hananiah said: “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon!

(Jeremiah 28:3) 
Within two full years, I will cause all the sacred vessels of the Temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took from this very place and carried away to Babylon, to be brought back to this place.

(Jeremiah 28:4) 
And King Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with all the people of Judah who were carried into captivity in Babylon—I will bring them back to this place,” says the Lord. “For I will shatter the yoke of the king of Babylon.”

(Jeremiah 28:5) 
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet, in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the Temple of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 28:6) 
Jeremiah the prophet said: “So be it! May the Lord do as you have said! May the Lord fulfill your words which you have prophesied, that He may bring back the sacred vessels to the Temple of the Lord, and all the exiles from Babylon to this very place.

(Jeremiah 28:7) 
Nevertheless, hear this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.

(Jeremiah 28:8) 
The prophets who were before me and before you, from ancient times, prophesied concerning many lands and great kingdoms about war, disaster, and famine.

(Jeremiah 28:9) 
But the prophet who prophesies peace—when his word comes to pass and what he has prophesied is fulfilled, then it will be known if the Lord truly sent that prophet.”

(Jeremiah 28:10) 
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.

(Jeremiah 28:11) 
And he said in the presence of all the people: “Thus says the Lord: So will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the necks of all the nations within two full years.” After this declaration, the people were encouraged to trust Hananiah's words.

(Jeremiah 28:12) 
And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.

(Jeremiah 28:13) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

(Jeremiah 28:14) 
“Go and say to Hananiah: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place, you will have a yoke of iron.

(Jeremiah 28:15) 
For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have placed an iron yoke upon the neck of all these nations, so that they must serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and they will serve him. Moreover, I have also given him the wild animals of the field.’”

(Jeremiah 28:16) 
And Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet: “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, and by your lies, you have made this people put their trust in a falsehood.

(Jeremiah 28:17) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you shall die, because you have spoken words of rebellion against the Lord.’”

(Jeremiah 28:18) 
And Hananiah the prophet died that same year, in the seventh month, just as Jeremiah had prophesied.

(Jeremiah 29:1) 
These are the words from the book that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem. It was addressed to the remaining elders who had been taken into exile, as well as to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had led from Jerusalem into Babylon.

(Jeremiah 29:2) 
This message was sent after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and skilled workers had all been taken from Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 29:3) 
The letter was carried by Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah. These men had been sent by King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, in Babylon. The letter said:

(Jeremiah 29:4) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles, all of whom I caused to be taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:

(Jeremiah 29:5) 
Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat the fruit they produce.

(Jeremiah 29:6) 
Take wives and have sons and daughters. Give your sons wives, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there in Babylon, and do not let your numbers diminish.

(Jeremiah 29:7) 
Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city where I have caused you to be taken into exile. Pray to the Lord for that city, because your own peace will depend on its peace.

(Jeremiah 29:8) 
For this is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Do not let your own prophets who are among you, or your diviners, deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you cause to have or interpret for yourselves.

(Jeremiah 29:9) 
For they prophesy lies to you in My name. I have not sent them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:10) 
For this is what the Lord says: When Babylon's seventy years begin to be completed, I will visit you. I will bring about My good promise to you, that I will bring you back to this place.

(Jeremiah 29:11) 
For I know My plans, which I plan for you, says the Lord. They are plans of peace and not of affliction, to give you a hopeful future and an expected end.

(Jeremiah 29:12) 
Then you will call upon Me, and you will come and pray to Me, and I will hear you.

(Jeremiah 29:13) 
You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart.

(Jeremiah 29:14) 
And I will be found by you, says the Lord. I will restore you from your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have driven you out, says the Lord. I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to go into exile.

(Jeremiah 29:15) 
You say, 'The Lord has raised up for us prophets in Babylon!'

(Jeremiah 29:16) 
But this is what the Lord says concerning the king who sits on David's throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city—your brethren who did not go out with you into exile:

(Jeremiah 29:17) 
This is what the Lord of Armies says: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, and famine, and pestilence. I will make them like vile figs, which cannot be eaten because they are so bad.

(Jeremiah 29:18) 
I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence. I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, an astonishment, a hiss, and a reproach among all the nations to which I have driven them out.

(Jeremiah 29:19) 
This will happen because they have not listened to My words, says the Lord. They did not hear the messages I sent to them by My servants the prophets, though I was diligent in sending them. And you yourselves did not listen, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:20) 
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles, all whom I have sent from Jerusalem into Babylon.

(Jeremiah 29:21) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and he will strike them down before your very eyes.

(Jeremiah 29:22) 
And from them will be taken a curse by all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon. They will say, 'May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon burned in the fire!'

(Jeremiah 29:23) 
This will happen because they have committed foolishness in Israel. They have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken a word falsely in My name, which I did not command them. I am the Judge and the Witness, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:24) 
And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say:

(Jeremiah 29:25) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the other priests, saying:

(Jeremiah 29:26) 
'The Lord has appointed you as priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, so that you should be an officer over every madman and prophet, and should put him in the stocks and in prison!'

(Jeremiah 29:27) 
'So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you?'

(Jeremiah 29:28) 
Shemaiah's letter continued: 'Because for this very reason he sent to us in Babylon, saying: 'It is a long time; build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.''

(Jeremiah 29:29) 
Then Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 29:30) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 29:31) 
Send a message to all the exiles, saying: 'This is what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has caused you to trust in a lie,'

(Jeremiah 29:32) 
'therefore this is what the Lord says: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for My people, says the Lord, because he has spoken rebellion against the Lord.'

(Jeremiah 30:1) 
This is the prophetic message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 30:2) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Write down all the words I have spoken to you in a scroll, for future generations.'

(Jeremiah 30:3) 
For behold, days are surely coming, declares the Lord, when I will reverse the captivity and restore My people, both Israel and Judah, declares the Lord. I will bring them back to the very land that I gave to their ancestors, and they will possess it once again, in lasting peace.

(Jeremiah 30:4) 
These, then, are the specific words that the Lord has spoken concerning both the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.

(Jeremiah 30:5) 
For this is what the Lord says: 'We have heard a terrifying cry, a sound of utter dread and not of peace.'

(Jeremiah 30:6) 
Ask now, and observe: can a man give birth? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labor, and every face turned pale with bitter anguish, as if in the throes of death?

(Jeremiah 30:7) 
Alas! For that day is great and terrible; there is no other like it. It is a time of extreme distress for Jacob—a period of unparalleled tribulation for God's chosen people—yet, in the end, he will be saved out of it.

(Jeremiah 30:8) 
And it will come to pass in that day, declares the Lord of hosts, that I will break the yoke of foreign oppression from your neck and tear off your bonds. Strangers will no longer make you their slaves or rule over you.

(Jeremiah 30:9) 
Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king—the Messiah, the true King from David's line—whom I will raise up for them to rule eternally.

(Jeremiah 30:10) 
Therefore, do not fear, My servant Jacob, declares the Lord, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from a distant land of exile, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return, find rest and security, and thrive, and no one will make him afraid or cause him terror.

(Jeremiah 30:11) 
For I am with you, declares the Lord, to save you. I will bring to a complete and utter end all the nations among whom I have scattered you. But I will not bring you to an utter end; rather, I will discipline you with precise justice, and I will by no means spare you as if you were innocent of sin.

(Jeremiah 30:12) 
For this is what the Lord says: 'Your brokenness seems incurable; your wound is a most grievous affliction.'

(Jeremiah 30:13) 
There is no one to plead your case or to bring about your healing; among all those who once claimed to love you, no one has truly cared for your recovery.

(Jeremiah 30:14) 
All your former allies and lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you out now in your distress. For I myself have struck you with the blow of an enemy, with cruel chastisement, because of the multitude of your iniquities and the severity of your hardened sins.

(Jeremiah 30:15) 
Why do you cry out over your crushing blow? Your pain seems incurable. Because of the multitude of your iniquities and your severe sins, I have done these things to you; this is the consequence of your actions.

(Jeremiah 30:16) 
Therefore, all who devour you will themselves be devoured; and all your adversaries, every single one of your enemies, will be led away into captivity. Those who plundered you will become plunder, and all who ravaged you I will give over to utter desolation and ruination.

(Jeremiah 30:17) 
For I will restore health to you and heal you of your deep wounds, declares the Lord, because they have called you 'Outcast Zion,' saying, 'This is Zion, and there is no one who cares for her or seeks her welfare.'

(Jeremiah 30:18) 
Thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob's dwellings and have compassion on his tents, restoring them to their former glory. The city will be rebuilt on its ancient mound, and the Holy Temple will be established according to its proper design and divine order.'

(Jeremiah 30:19) 
From them will emanate songs of thanksgiving and the joyful sound of those who celebrate. I will multiply their numbers, and they will not decrease; I will bring them glory, and they will not be diminished or brought low.

(Jeremiah 30:20) 
And their children will be as they were in days of old, and their community will be established and secure before My presence. I will then visit My judgment upon all who oppress them and cause them tribulation.

(Jeremiah 30:21) 
Their ruler will be one of their own, a native, and their sovereign will come forth from their midst. I will bring him near, and he will approach Me directly. For who is this, declares the Lord, who would dare to risk his very life and dedicate his heart to draw near to Me as an intermediary?

(Jeremiah 30:22) 
And you will once again be My people, and I will truly be your God, in a renewed covenant.

(Jeremiah 30:23) 
Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord, His fierce wrath bursting forth, a continuing storm, will come crashing down upon the heads of the wicked.

(Jeremiah 30:24) 
The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until He has accomplished and completely carried out the intentions and purposes of His heart. In the last days, you will understand these things clearly and fully.

(Jeremiah 31:1) 
In that time, the Lord declares, I will be the God of all the tribes of Israel, and they will be My people.

(Jeremiah 31:2) 
This is what the Lord says: The people who survived the sword found grace and favor in the desert. Israel will journey to its place of rest.

(Jeremiah 31:3) 
The Lord appeared to them from far away. He said, 'I have loved you, My people, with an everlasting love, a love that continues forever. That is why I have drawn you to Myself with steadfast mercy.'

(Jeremiah 31:4) 
And I will build you up again, and you will be built up, O virgin Israel, a nation restored to purity. You will again adorn yourself with your tambourines, and you will go forth in the joyful dance of those celebrating.

(Jeremiah 31:5) 
You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. Those who plant them will enjoy their fruits, and they will cultivate them securely, free from fear.

(Jeremiah 31:6) 
For there will be a day when the watchmen on the mountain of Ephraim will call out, saying: 'Arise! Let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God!'

(Jeremiah 31:7) 
For this is what the Lord says: Sing with great joy over Jacob, and shout among the chief nations. Proclaim, praise, and say: 'Save, O Lord, Your people, the remnant of Israel!'

(Jeremiah 31:8) 
Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and the one giving birth, all together—a great assembly of those returning here.

(Jeremiah 31:9) 
They will come with weeping for their past sins, but I will lead them with comfort. I will guide them by streams of water on a straight path where they will not stumble. For I have become a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn son, treated with special favor.

(Jeremiah 31:10) 
Hear the word of the Lord, O nations, and declare it in the distant islands, and say: 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and He will guard him like a shepherd guards his flock.'

(Jeremiah 31:11) 
For the Lord has redeemed Jacob and has set him free from the hand of one stronger than himself.

(Jeremiah 31:12) 
And they will come and sing praises on Mount Zion. They will stream together to receive the good things from the Lord: abundant grain, new wine, and oil, and the young of flocks and herds. Their souls will be like a well-watered garden, and they will hunger no more, neither physically nor spiritually.

(Jeremiah 31:13) 
Then the virgin nation will rejoice in the dance, and young men and old men will celebrate together. For I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and make them glad instead of sad.

(Jeremiah 31:14) 
And I will satisfy the souls of the priests with rich abundance, and My people will be filled with My good things, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:15) 
This is what the Lord says: A voice is heard in Ramah, a sound of bitter lamentation, weeping, and deep sorrow. Rachel is weeping for her children and refuses to be comforted for them, because they are no longer present.

(Jeremiah 31:16) 
This is what the Lord says: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears. For there is a reward for your labor and suffering, declares the Lord. Your children will return from the land of the enemy.

(Jeremiah 31:17) 
And there is hope for your future, declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own territory and borders.

(Jeremiah 31:18) 
I have clearly heard Ephraim lamenting: 'You have disciplined me, and I have learned my lesson like an untamed young bull that must be broken. Turn me back to You, and I will be restored, for You are the Lord my God.'

(Jeremiah 31:19) 
Indeed, after You turned me back, I repented. And after You showed me my errors, I struck my thigh in deep regret and sorrow. I was ashamed and disgraced, for I bore the reproach and consequences of my youthful rebellion.

(Jeremiah 31:20) 
Is not Ephraim My precious son? Is he not a delightful child to Me? For as often as I speak concerning him, I still remember him with love and tenderness. Because of this, My innermost being yearns for him; I will surely have abundant mercy on him, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:21) 
Set up signposts for yourself, place markers for guidance to the way back. Direct your heart toward the straight path, the way in which you once walked obediently. Return, O virgin Israel, return to your cities.

(Jeremiah 31:22) 
How long will you waver and wander aimlessly in your desires, O faithless daughter? For the Lord has created a new thing on the earth: A woman will encompass a man. This signifies a unique and unprecedented new order established by God, often understood as a spiritual reversal or a prophecy pointing towards the Incarnation of Christ.

(Jeremiah 31:23) 
This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their captivity: 'May the Lord bless you, O dwelling place of righteousness, O holy mountain of Zion!'

(Jeremiah 31:24) 
And Judah and all its cities will dwell there together, both farmers and those who lead flocks.

(Jeremiah 31:25) 
For I have satisfied the thirsty soul, and I have filled every hungry soul with good things.

(Jeremiah 31:26) 
At this, I awoke, as if from a deep vision or a blessed sleep, and I looked around. My sleep had been sweet and refreshing to me.

(Jeremiah 31:27) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of men and the seed of animals, causing them to multiply abundantly.

(Jeremiah 31:28) 
And just as I watched over them with vigilance to pluck up, to tear down, to demolish, to destroy, and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, declares the Lord. My active hand will be for their good.

(Jeremiah 31:29) 
In those days, they will no longer say the proverb: 'The fathers ate sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on edge,' blaming past generations for their own suffering.

(Jeremiah 31:30) 
Instead, each one will die for his own iniquity. Every person who eats sour grapes—his own teeth will be set on edge, for he will bear the consequences of his own actions.

(Jeremiah 31:31) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

(Jeremiah 31:32) 
This new covenant will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt—that covenant which they broke and rendered void, even though I was their Lord and Master, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:33) 
But this will be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put My law within their inner being, and I will write it on their hearts, making it an internal spiritual guide. And I will be their God, and they will be My people.

(Jeremiah 31:34) 
And no longer will each man need to teach his neighbor, or each man teach his brother, saying: 'Know the Lord!' For they will all know Me intimately, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more at all.

(Jeremiah 31:35) 
This is what the Lord says, who gives the sun for the light of day, and the moon and stars for the light of night; who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the Lord of hosts is His name, indicating His power over all creation.

(Jeremiah 31:36) 
If these fixed laws of nature for the sun, moon, and stars should cease from before Me, declares the Lord, then also the offspring of Israel will cease from being a nation before Me for all days. This is a promise of Israel's eternal existence as a people.

(Jeremiah 31:37) 
This is what the Lord says: If the universe above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I would also cast away all the offspring of Israel because of all they have done, declares the Lord. As the former is impossible, so is the latter.

(Jeremiah 31:38) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt for the Lord, extending from the Tower of Hananeel all the way to the Corner Gate.

(Jeremiah 31:39) 
And the measuring line will go out further, beyond the normal boundary, encompassing all the hill of Gareb and encircling Goath.

(Jeremiah 31:40) 
And the entire valley of dead bodies and ashes, a place once of waste and defilement, and all the region of Hammeel up to the Kidron Valley, and as far as the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, will be holy to the Lord. It will not be uprooted or destroyed again, ever.

(Jeremiah 32:1) 
The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah—which was also the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign.

(Jeremiah 32:2) 
At that time, the Babylonian king's army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was located at the king of Judah’s palace.

(Jeremiah 32:3) 
King Zedekiah of Judah had locked Jeremiah up, asking, 'Why do you prophesy, saying: ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it’?'

(Jeremiah 32:4) 
‘And King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; instead, he will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He will speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye.’

(Jeremiah 32:5) 
‘He will lead Zedekiah away to Babylon, and Zedekiah will remain there until I pay him attention,’ declares the Lord. ‘If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will have no success at all.’

(Jeremiah 32:6) 
Then Jeremiah said: 'The word of the Lord came to me, saying:'

(Jeremiah 32:7) 
‘Listen, Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you with an offer. He will tell you to buy his field, which is in Anathoth, because you have the right to redeem it by your family connection.’

(Jeremiah 32:8) 
Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard, just as the Lord had foretold. He said to me, ‘Buy my field that is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin. You have the right to inherit it and to buy it. So take possession of it!’ And I understood that this was indeed the word from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 32:9) 
So I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel, which was in Anathoth. I weighed out the silver for him—seven shekels and ten pieces of silver.

(Jeremiah 32:10) 
I wrote the details in a deed, sealed it, and had witnesses sign. Then I weighed out the money on the scales.

(Jeremiah 32:11) 
Then I took the deed of purchase—both the sealed copy and the unsealed copy—in accordance with the customs and legal requirements.

(Jeremiah 32:12) 
I handed the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, the son of Maaseiah. This was done in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who had signed the purchase deed, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard.

(Jeremiah 32:13) 
And I instructed Baruch in their presence, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:14) 
‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents—this sealed purchase deed and this unsealed document—and put them in a clay jar so they may last for many days.’

(Jeremiah 32:15) 
‘For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought and owned in this land.’

(Jeremiah 32:16) 
After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:17) 
‘Ah, Sovereign Lord, God! Behold, You created the universe and the earth by Your great power and Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.’

(Jeremiah 32:18) 
‘You show loving-kindness to thousands, but also bring the punishment for the iniquity of parents upon their children and their descendants after them. O Great and Mighty God, whose name is the Lord of armies.’

(Jeremiah 32:19) 
‘Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought! Your eyes observe all the ways of the children of Adam, so that You may give to each one according to their ways and according to the fruit of their deeds.’

(Jeremiah 32:20) 
‘You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and have continued to do so, even to this day, both in Israel and among mankind. You have made a Name for Yourself, which is renowned to this very day.’

(Jeremiah 32:21) 
‘You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.’

(Jeremiah 32:22) 
‘You gave them this land, which You had sworn to their fathers to give them—a land flowing with milk and honey.’

(Jeremiah 32:23) 
‘They entered it and took possession, but they did not obey Your voice and did not walk in Your law. They did not do anything You commanded them to do, and so all these calamities have come upon them.’

(Jeremiah 32:24) 
‘See how the siege ramps are built right up to the city walls for its capture! The city has been handed over to the Chaldeans, who are fighting against it, through the sword, famine, and pestilence. Whatever You spoke has now come to pass, and You Yourself see it!’

(Jeremiah 32:25) 
‘Yet You, Sovereign Lord, God, said to me: “Buy the field with money and have witnesses,” even though the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’

(Jeremiah 32:26) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:27) 
‘Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all living beings. Is anything too difficult for Me?’

(Jeremiah 32:28) 
‘Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans and to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will capture it.’

(Jeremiah 32:29) 
‘The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come in and set it on fire. They will burn it down, along with the houses on whose rooftops they offered sacrifices to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke My anger.’

(Jeremiah 32:30) 
‘For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have continually done evil in My sight from their youth. Indeed, the children of Israel have provoked Me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the Lord.’

(Jeremiah 32:31) 
‘This city has been a constant provocation of My wrath and indignation from the day it was built until this very day, so that it must be removed from My sight.’

(Jeremiah 32:32) 
‘Because of all the evil that the children of Israel and the children of Judah committed—provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands with their wooden and stone idols.’

(Jeremiah 32:33) 
‘They turned their backs to Me, not their faces. Even though I taught them diligently, rising early and instructing them, they refused to listen to My discipline.’

(Jeremiah 32:34) 
‘They set up their detestable idols in the very House where My Name is invoked, to defile it.’

(Jeremiah 32:35) 
‘They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to consecrate their sons and daughters to Molech. I never commanded them to do such an abomination, nor did it ever enter My mind that they would lead Judah into such sin.’

(Jeremiah 32:36) 
‘And now, concerning all these things, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about this city, about which you yourselves are saying, “It will be handed over to the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and pestilence.”’

(Jeremiah 32:37) 
‘Behold, I will gather them from all the lands to which I have driven them in My furious anger, My indignation, and My great wrath. I will bring them back to this very place and make them dwell here securely.’

(Jeremiah 32:38) 
‘They will be My people, and I will be their God.’

(Jeremiah 32:39) 
‘I will give them one heart and one way of living, so that they may fear Me always. This will be for their own good and for the good of their children after them.’

(Jeremiah 32:40) 
‘I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them. And I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me.’

(Jeremiah 32:41) 
‘I will rejoice over them by doing good to them. I will plant them firmly in this land with all My heart and all My soul, truly and permanently.’

(Jeremiah 32:42) 
‘For this is what the Lord says: Just as I brought all this great disaster upon these people, so also will I bring upon them all the good that I promised them.’

(Jeremiah 32:43) 
‘Fields will again be bought and owned in this land, about which you are now saying, “It is desolate, without man or beast, and given into the hands of the Chaldeans.”’

(Jeremiah 32:44) 
‘Fields will be bought for money, deeds will be written, sealed, and signed by witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the areas around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the western foothills, and in the cities of the Negev. For I will restore their fortunes,’ declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still imprisoned in the court of the prison, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:2) 
Thus says the Lord, who will bring these things about, who will shape them, and who will establish them—the Lord is His name:

(Jeremiah 33:3) 
Call to Me, and I will hear you. I will declare to you great and unshakeable things, which you do not know.

(Jeremiah 33:4) 
For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been torn down to build up defenses against the siege towers and the ramparts of the enemy.

(Jeremiah 33:5) 
And concerning those who went out to fight against the Chaldeans: they will fill those houses with the corpses of the men whom I struck down in My wrath and in My indignation, because I hid My face from them on account of all their wickedness.

(Jeremiah 33:6) 
Behold, I will bring them healing and restoration, and I will cure them. I will reveal to them a lasting abundance of peace and truth.

(Jeremiah 33:7) 
I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as they were in the beginning.

(Jeremiah 33:8) 
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they sinned against Me. I will forgive all their iniquities by which they sinned against Me and spurned Me.

(Jeremiah 33:9) 
And Jerusalem will be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good things I do for them. They will be in awe and wonder at all the good things and all the peace that I bring to them.

(Jeremiah 33:10) 
Thus says the Lord: In this place, which you say is a desolate wilderness—where there is neither man nor beast—and in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem, and in its streets which are laid waste, without man, without inhabitant, and without beast, there will still be heard:

(Jeremiah 33:11) 
...the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying: 'Give praise to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for His mercy endures forever!' And the voice of those bringing offerings into the house of the Lord. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were in the beginning, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:12) 
Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this desolate place, where there is neither man nor beast, and in all its cities, there will again be a dwelling for shepherds, where flocks will lie down in peace.

(Jeremiah 33:13) 
And in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the plain, and in the cities toward the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one counting them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:14) 
Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up a righteous Branch for David. He will execute true judgment and justice in the land.

(Jeremiah 33:15) 
In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which they will call Him: 'The Lord is Our Righteousness.'

(Jeremiah 33:16) 
For thus says the Lord: A man from the line of David will never be lacking to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.

(Jeremiah 33:17) 
And from the priests and Levites, a man will never be lacking before Me who offers burnt offerings, burns grain offerings, and makes sacrifices every single day.

(Jeremiah 33:18) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:19) 
Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night can be broken, so that day and night do not come at their appointed time,

(Jeremiah 33:20) 
...then My covenant can also be broken with David My servant, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and likewise with the Levites, who are My priestly ministers.

(Jeremiah 33:21) 
...then just as the stars of the heavens cannot be counted, and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so also will I make the descendants of David My servant, and the Levites My ministers, countless in number.

(Jeremiah 33:22) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:23) 
Have you not seen what this people has said, saying: 'The two families whom the Lord had chosen, Judah and Israel, have now been utterly cast off?' Thus, they have despised My people, considering them no longer a nation before them.

(Jeremiah 33:24) 
Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with day and night can be broken, and if the laws of the universe and the earth can be undone,

(Jeremiah 33:25) 
...then also My covenant will be broken with the descendants of Jacob and David My servant. Then I would no longer choose rulers from their descendants to preside over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Jeremiah 33:26) 
For just as the stars of the universe cannot be counted and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so also will I make the descendants of David My servant and the Levites My ministers countless in number.

(Jeremiah 34:1) 
This is the message that came from the Lord to Jeremiah at the time when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and all of his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his power, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying:

(Jeremiah 34:2) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Go and speak to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and tell him: This is what the Lord says: Behold, I will give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

(Jeremiah 34:3) 
And you will not escape from his hand, but you will be captured and handed over to him. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth will speak to your mouth, and you will go to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 34:4) 
Nevertheless, hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: This is what the Lord says to you: 'You will not die by the sword.'

(Jeremiah 34:5) 
You will die in peace. And just as they burned spices for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will perform the funeral burning ceremony for you. And they will mourn for you, saying, 'Alas, O king!' For I myself have spoken this word, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 34:6) 
And Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 34:7) 
And the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, against Lachish and against Azekah. For these were the only fortified cities of Judah that still remained.

(Jeremiah 34:8) 
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem,

(Jeremiah 34:9) 
that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, whether Hebrew men or Hebrew women, making them free. And that no one should keep them, that is, any Jew, in servitude.

(Jeremiah 34:10) 
So all the officials and all the people, who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant so they would no longer keep them in servitude, listened to it. And they obeyed and set them free.

(Jeremiah 34:11) 
But afterwards they turned back. And they took back their male and female servants whom they had set free, and they subjected them to be male and female slaves again.

(Jeremiah 34:12) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 34:13) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I made a covenant with your fathers on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying: '

(Jeremiah 34:14) 
'At the end of seven years, each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to him; and when he has served you for six years, you shall set him free from you.' But your fathers did not listen to Me, nor did they incline their ear to My commands.

(Jeremiah 34:15) 
And you yourselves turned today and did what was right in My eyes, by proclaiming liberty each man to his neighbor. And you made a covenant before Me in the Temple, in the house where My name is invoked.

(Jeremiah 34:16) 
But you turned back and profaned My name. And each of you took back his male servant and each his female servant, whom you had set free to be at liberty. And you subjected them, so that they became your male and female slaves again.

(Jeremiah 34:17) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'You have not listened to Me, to proclaim liberty each man to his brother and each man to his friend.' Behold, I proclaim liberty to you, says the Lord, a liberty to die by the sword, by pestilence, and by famine. And I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

(Jeremiah 34:18) 
And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant and have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut a calf in two and passed between its parts—this was a ritual for making solemn covenants—

(Jeremiah 34:19) 
I will give the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.

(Jeremiah 34:20) 
I will give them into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their lives. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth.

(Jeremiah 34:21) 
And Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his officials, I will give into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who had withdrawn from you.

(Jeremiah 34:22) 
Behold, I will command, says the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city of Jerusalem. And they will fight against it, and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, so that there will be no inhabitant.

(Jeremiah 35:1) 
This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord. It happened during the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah. The Lord's message stated:

(Jeremiah 35:2) 
"Go to the family of the Rechabites. Speak to them, and bring them into the Temple of the Lord, into one of its chambers. Then, offer them wine to drink."

(Jeremiah 35:3) 
So I, Jeremiah, brought Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, along with his brothers and all the members of the Rechabite family—their sons, their wives, and their entire company.

(Jeremiah 35:4) 
I led them into the Temple of the Lord. We went to the chamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located near the chamber of the princes, and it was above the chamber of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, who was the gatekeeper of the Temple.

(Jeremiah 35:5) 
Then I set before the Rechabite family, there in their chamber, many cups and goblets, all filled with wine. And I said to them, "Drink this wine."

(Jeremiah 35:6) 
They answered me, "We will not drink wine. Our ancestor, Jonadab, son of Rechab, commanded us, saying: 'You and your sons must never drink wine, not for all time.

(Jeremiah 35:7) 
You shall not build houses to live in. You shall not plant any crops. You shall not plant vineyards, nor possess any of your own. Instead, you must live in tents all your days. This way, you will live many days upon the face of the earth where you are dwelling as sojourners —people who live in a place but do not own land or settle permanently.'"

(Jeremiah 35:8) 
Therefore, we have obeyed and done everything that Jonadab, our ancestor, commanded us. We have not drunk wine throughout our entire lives—neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters.

(Jeremiah 35:9) 
We have not built houses to live in, and we have had no vineyard, no field, and no crops to plant.

(Jeremiah 35:10) 
We have always lived in tents, exactly as our ancestor Jonadab commanded us."

(Jeremiah 35:11) 
"However, when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up and invaded our land, we said, 'Come, let us go into Jerusalem to escape the army of the Chaldeans and the army of Syria.' That is why we are currently staying in Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 35:12) 
Then the Lord's message came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 35:13) 
This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not accept My instruction and listen to My words?' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 35:14) 
The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons—that they should not drink wine—have been strong and effective. They have not drunk wine to this very day, and they have diligently kept the command of their ancestor. But I, the Lord, have spoken to you repeatedly, rising early and speaking diligently, yet you have not obeyed Me.

(Jeremiah 35:15) 
I sent all My servants, the prophets, to you, rising early and sending them persistently. I told them to say: 'Return, each one of you, from your wicked ways, and do good works. Do not follow foreign gods, nor worship them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers.' But you have not paid attention, nor have you listened to Me.

(Jeremiah 35:16) 
Because the sons of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have kept the command of their ancestor, which he gave them, but this people—the people of Judah—has not obeyed Me:

(Jeremiah 35:17) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity and disaster that I have spoken against them. This is because I spoke to them, but they did not listen; and I called to them, but they did not answer Me.'"

(Jeremiah 35:18) 
Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rechabites: "This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab, and have kept all his statutes, and have done everything he commanded you;

(Jeremiah 35:19) 
therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: "There shall never fail to be a man from the lineage of Jonadab, son of Rechab, who stands in My presence, serving Me, for all time.'"

(Jeremiah 36:1) 
This happened in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim, who was the son of Josiah and king of Judah. This word came from the Lord to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:2) 
“Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations. Write everything I have said since I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, up until this very day.”

(Jeremiah 36:3) 
“Perhaps the entire house of Judah will listen to all the terrible things that I plan to do to them. If they do, each person might turn away from their wicked path. Then I will be merciful and forgive their evil deeds and their sins.”

(Jeremiah 36:4) 
So Jeremiah called Baruch, the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote down everything Jeremiah dictated from the mouth of the Lord—all the words the Lord had spoken to Jeremiah—onto a scroll.

(Jeremiah 36:5) 
Then Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:6) 
“I am confined and cannot go into the Lord’s Temple.”

(Jeremiah 36:7) 
“Therefore, you go in and read from the scroll. On it, you wrote down the words of the Lord at my dictation. Read it aloud to the people in the Lord’s Temple on a day of fasting. Also read it to all the people of Judah who come from their various towns.”

(Jeremiah 36:8) 
So Baruch, the son of Neriah, did everything that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. He read the words of the Lord from the scroll inside the Lord’s Temple.

(Jeremiah 36:9) 
It happened in the fifth year of King Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month. All the people in Jerusalem and the entire multitude from the towns of Judah who had gathered together in Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord.

(Jeremiah 36:10) 
And Baruch read Jeremiah’s words from the scroll in the Lord’s Temple, specifically in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe, which was in the upper court. All the people were listening.

(Jeremiah 36:11) 
Now Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord as they were read from the scroll.

(Jeremiah 36:12) 
Then Micaiah went down to the king’s palace, to the scribe’s chamber. There, all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

(Jeremiah 36:13) 
And Micaiah reported to them all the words that he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.

(Jeremiah 36:14) 
So all the officials sent Jehudi, the son of Neriah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying: “Take the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people and bring it with you. Come here.” So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the scroll in his hand and went to them.

(Jeremiah 36:15) 
And they said to him, “Sit down and read these words to us.” So Baruch read them aloud to them.

(Jeremiah 36:16) 
When they had heard all the words, they were astonished, each one looking at his neighbor. And they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”

(Jeremiah 36:17) 
And they questioned Baruch, saying, “Tell us, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”

(Jeremiah 36:18) 
And Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, as if reading them aloud, and I wrote them down on the scroll with ink.”

(Jeremiah 36:19) 
Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, both you and Jeremiah. No one should know where you are.”

(Jeremiah 36:20) 
They then went to the king in the courtyard. They reported all the words to the king, after placing the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe.

(Jeremiah 36:21) 
And the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. Jehudi took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it aloud, in the hearing of the king and all the officials who stood around the king.

(Jeremiah 36:22) 
The king was sitting in his winter palace in the ninth month. A fire was burning before him in the brazier.

(Jeremiah 36:23) 
After Jehudi had read just three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut the scroll with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier. He kept throwing pieces until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier.

(Jeremiah 36:24) 
Neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words showed any fear, nor did they tear their clothes in repentance, which was the custom when hearing a dire prophecy.

(Jeremiah 36:25) 
However, Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, but he did not listen to them.

(Jeremiah 36:26) 
Then the king commanded Jerahmeel, the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord hid them, protecting them from capture.

(Jeremiah 36:27) 
After the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah again, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:28) 
“Take another scroll again and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.”

(Jeremiah 36:29) 
“And to King Jehoiakim of Judah, you are to say: ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned this scroll, saying, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land, sweeping away both people and animals?”’”

(Jeremiah 36:30) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah: ‘He will have no successor to sit on the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out, exposed to the scorching heat by day and the freezing cold by night, without a proper burial.’”

(Jeremiah 36:31) 
“‘And I will punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their wickedness. I will bring upon them, upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the disaster that I have declared against them, because they did not listen.’”

(Jeremiah 36:32) 
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the scribe. And Baruch wrote on it, from Jeremiah’s dictation, all the words of the book that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire. In addition, many other similar words were added to it, emphasizing the severity of the prophecies.

(Jeremiah 37:37:1) 
King Zedekiah, Josiah's son, came to power, reigning in place of Jehoiachin, who was the son of Jehoiakim. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had appointed Zedekiah over the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 37:37:2) 
But Zedekiah himself, along with his officials and the common people of the land, did not listen to the messages from the Lord that He had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 37:37:3) 
King Zedekiah sent Jehucal, Shelemiah's son, and Zephaniah, Maaseiah's son who was a priest, to Jeremiah the prophet. The king asked them to say: “Please pray for us to the Lord our God.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:4) 
At this time, Jeremiah was still moving about freely among the people of Jerusalem, for the other prophets had already been imprisoned.

(Jeremiah 37:37:5) 
At that very moment, the Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt to provide aid to Judah. When the Chaldean forces, who were besieging Jerusalem, heard this news, they temporarily withdrew from Jerusalem to meet the Egyptian threat.

(Jeremiah 37:37:6) 
Then a specific message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

(Jeremiah 37:37:7) 
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Me: ‘Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which came out to help you, will return to its own land of Egypt.'

(Jeremiah 37:37:8) 
And then, after dealing with the Egyptians, the Chaldeans will return. They will fight against this city, capture it, and burn it down completely with fire.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:9) 
“This is what the Lord says: Do not deceive yourselves by thinking, ‘The Chaldeans will surely go away and withdraw from us permanently.’ I tell you, they will not withdraw permanently.

(Jeremiah 37:37:10) 
Even if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting against you, and only a few wounded men remained from them, each one of those men would still rise up from his tent and come to burn this city with fire. Their victory is inevitable.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:11) 
So, when the Chaldean army had indeed withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s advancing army,

(Jeremiah 37:37:12) 
Jeremiah decided to leave Jerusalem. His purpose was to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion of family land and settle a property dispute among his kinsmen.

(Jeremiah 37:37:13) 
But when Jeremiah arrived at the Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem, a guard was stationed there named Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. He seized Jeremiah the prophet and accused him, saying: “You are trying to desert to the Chaldeans!”

(Jeremiah 37:37:14) 
Jeremiah immediately responded, saying: “That is false! I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him. Instead, Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him before the leading officials of the city.

(Jeremiah 37:37:15) 
The officials were furious with Jeremiah. They ordered him to be beaten severely and then cast him into a prison that had been set up in the house of Jonathan the scribe, because Jonathan’s house had been converted into a temporary jail.

(Jeremiah 37:37:16) 
So Jeremiah was brought down into the cistern, which served as a dungeon, and into the cramped prison cells. Jeremiah remained there for many days.

(Jeremiah 37:37:17) 
However, King Zedekiah later sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the palace. He questioned him secretly in his own house, asking: “Is there any new message from the Lord?” Jeremiah answered straightforwardly: “There is!” And then Jeremiah added: “You will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:18) 
Jeremiah then said to King Zedekiah: “What wrong have I done to you, or to your officials, or to your people, that you have thrown me into this house of imprisonment?”

(Jeremiah 37:37:19) 
“Where are your own prophets who prophesied to you,” Jeremiah challenged, “the ones who kept saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?”

(Jeremiah 37:37:20) 
“Now therefore, please listen, my lord king,” Jeremiah pleaded. “Let my urgent appeal come before you, and please do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, for if I return there, I will surely die.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:21) 
So King Zedekiah gave a command that Jeremiah should be confined in the court of the guardhouse. He also ordered that Jeremiah be given a loaf of bread each day from the bakers’ street, and this continued until all the bread in the city was completely consumed. And so Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:1) 
Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying:

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:2) 
The Lord God says this: 'Whoever remains in this city will die by sword, by famine, and by plague. But whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live; his life will be spared as if by salvation, though he will be captured.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:3) 
The Lord God says this: 'This city will certainly be handed over into the power of the army of the King of Babylon, and they will capture it.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:4) 
Then the princes said to the king: 'We ask that this man be put to death. Because by saying words like these to them, he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and also the hands of all the people. For this man is not seeking the peace of these people, but their harm.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:5) 
And King Zedekiah said: 'Look, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing to oppose you.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:6) 
So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the prison. They let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now there was only mud in the cistern, not water, so Jeremiah sank into the mud.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:7) 
Now Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's household, heard that they had thrown Jeremiah into the cistern. (The king was then sitting at the Benjamin Gate).

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:8) 
So Ebedmelech left the king's household and spoke to the king, saying:

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:9) 
'My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, throwing him into the cistern so he might die there from hunger. For there is no more bread left in the city.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:10) 
Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying: 'Take thirty men from here with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:11) 
So Ebedmelech took the men with him. He went into the king's house, to the room beneath the treasury, and from there he took old rags and worn-out clothes. And he let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:12) 
Then Ebedmelech said to Jeremiah: 'Put these old rags, these worn-out and decayed clothes, under your armpits beneath the ropes.' And Jeremiah did so.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:13) 
So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and brought him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:14) 
King Zedekiah then sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to him at the third entrance, which was in the house of the Lord. And he said to Jeremiah: 'I am going to ask you a question. Do not hide anything from me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:15) 
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: 'If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:16) 
So King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying: 'As the Lord lives, who created our lives, I will neither put you to death nor hand you over to these men who are seeking your life.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:17) 
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: 'The Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: If you go out and surrender to the princes of the King of Babylon, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burned with fire; and you and your household will live.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:18) 
'But if you do not go out and surrender to the princes of the King of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire. And you will not escape from their hand.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:19) 
And King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah: 'I am afraid of the Jewish citizens who have deserted to the Chaldeans; I am afraid that I might be handed over to them, and they would mock me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:20) 
But Jeremiah said: 'They will not hand you over. Listen, I beg you, to the voice of the Lord that I am speaking to you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:21) 
'But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the Lord has shown me:'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:22) 
'Behold, all the women who are left in the house of the King of Judah will be led out to the princes of the King of Babylon. And they themselves will say: “Your trusted friends have deceived you and have overcome you! They have let your feet sink into the mud, and they have led you astray into a slippery place.”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:23) 
'All your wives and your children will be led out to the Chaldeans. And you yourself will not escape from their hands, but will be captured by the hands of the King of Babylon. And this city will be burned with fire.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:24) 
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah: 'Let no one know these words, and you will not die.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:25) 
'But if the princes hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you: “Tell us what you said to the king, and do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:26) 
'Then you shall say to them: “I presented my plea before the king, asking him not to send me back to Jonathan's house, lest I die there.”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:27) 
So all the princes came to Jeremiah and questioned him; and he answered them according to all the words that the king had commanded him. So they ceased questioning him, for nothing had been heard about the actual conversation.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:28) 
So Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day Jerusalem was captured. And the word of the Lord came to him.

(Jeremiah 39:1) 
In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign as King of Judah, during the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, came with his entire army to Jerusalem and laid siege to the city.

(Jeremiah 39:2) 
Then, in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of that month, the city's defenses were breached.

(Jeremiah 39:3) 
All the princes of the King of Babylon entered the city and took their seats in the Middle Gate. These included Nergal-sharezer (the Samgar-nebo), Sarsechim (the Rab-saris), Nergal-sharezer (the Rab-mag), and all the other remaining princes of the King of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 39:4) 
But when King Zedekiah of Judah and all his fighting men saw them, they fled from the city by night. They went through the King’s Garden gate, which was between the two walls, and then escaped toward the desert road.

(Jeremiah 39:5) 
The Chaldean army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had seized him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, where the king pronounced judgment upon him.

(Jeremiah 39:6) 
The King of Babylon then executed Zedekiah's sons at Riblah, right before his very eyes. Nebuchadnezzar also killed all the nobles of Judah.

(Jeremiah 39:7) 
He also put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze chains so that he could be led away to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 39:8) 
The Chaldeans set the king's palace and the people's homes on fire. They also tore down the walls of Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 39:9) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away into exile in Babylon the rest of the people who had remained in the city, along with the deserters who had gone over to him, and all the remaining people.

(Jeremiah 39:10) 
But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, left some of the poorest people in the land of Judah, those who had absolutely nothing. On that same day, he gave them vineyards and cisterns for their use.

(Jeremiah 39:11) 
Now, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had given specific orders concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard. He had said:

(Jeremiah 39:12) 
"Take Jeremiah. Watch over him carefully and do not cause him any harm. Instead, treat him exactly as he wishes."

(Jeremiah 39:13) 
So Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, along with Nebushazban (the Rab-saris), and Nergal-sharezer (the Rab-mag), and all the chief officers of the King of Babylon, sent men.

(Jeremiah 39:14) 
They sent for Jeremiah and had him brought out of the court of the prison. Then they entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, so that he could be taken to his home and live among his own people.

(Jeremiah 39:15) 
While Jeremiah was still confined in the court of the prison, the word of the Lord had come to him, saying:

(Jeremiah 39:16) 
"Go and tell Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian: 'Thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I am bringing My words of judgment upon this city, for evil and not for good. They will be fulfilled before your very eyes on that day."'

(Jeremiah 39:17) 
"But I will rescue you on that day," declares the Lord, "and you will not be handed over to the men you fear."

(Jeremiah 39:18) 
"For I will certainly deliver you. You will not fall by the sword, but you will save your life because you trusted in Me," declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 40:1) 
The word from the Lord came to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, released him from Ramah. Nebuzaradan had taken Jeremiah, bound in chains, from among all the people who were being exiled from Jerusalem and the land of Judea, as they were being led away to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 40:2) 
So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took Jeremiah aside and said to him: “The Lord your God has spoken this disaster against this land.”

(Jeremiah 40:3) 
He has brought it about. The Lord has done exactly as He said He would, because you sinned against the Lord and did not listen to His voice. Therefore, this word from God has come to pass upon you.

(Jeremiah 40:4) 
“Now, look, I am releasing you today from the chains that were on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will personally watch over you and care for you. But if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, then stay here. See, the whole land is before you; you may go wherever you please, and wherever you want to go, go there.”

(Jeremiah 40:5) 
When Jeremiah remained silent and gave no answer, Nebuzaradan spoke again: “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed as governor over the cities of Judah. You can live with him among the remaining people there, or you can go anywhere else that pleases you.” The captain of the guard also gave Jeremiah provisions and a gift, and then he let him go.

(Jeremiah 40:6) 
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, in Mizpah. He lived with Gedaliah among the people who were still left in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 40:7) 
Now, all the commanders of the armies who had been scattered throughout the surrounding regions—they, along with their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, as governor over the land. The king had entrusted to him the care of the men, women, and children, and the poorest of the land, who had not been taken into exile in Babylon.

(Jeremiah 40:8) 
So these men came to Gedaliah in Mizpah, along with their soldiers: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, the sons of Kareah; Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai; and Jezaniah, the son of Maacah.

(Jeremiah 40:9) 
Then Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, made an oath to them and their men, saying: “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and things will go well for you.”

(Jeremiah 40:10) 
“Look, I myself will reside in Mizpah to stand before the Chaldeans who come to us and to carry out their commands. As for you, go and gather your wine harvest, your grain harvest, and your olive oil. Store these provisions in your vessels, and then settle in the cities you have taken possession of.”

(Jeremiah 40:11) 
And all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and in all the other surrounding regions—when they heard that the king of Babylon had allowed a remnant of the Jewish people to remain in the land of Judah, and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them—

(Jeremiah 40:12) 
—all these Jewish people returned from all the places to which they had fled. They came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah in Mizpah, and they gathered a very abundant harvest of wine, grain, and olive oil.

(Jeremiah 40:13) 
Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who had been scattered in the surrounding regions, came to Gedaliah in Mizpah.

(Jeremiah 40:14) 
And they said to him: “Do you not know that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, to murder you?” But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, did not believe what they told him.

(Jeremiah 40:15) 
Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, spoke to Gedaliah privately in Mizpah, saying: “I will go and kill Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, without anyone else knowing about it. This is so he cannot murder you, which would cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to be scattered again, and the entire remnant of Judah to perish.”

(Jeremiah 40:16) 
But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, the son of Kareah: “You must not do this thing, for you are speaking a lie about Ishmael.”

(Jeremiah 41:41:1) 
It happened in the seventh month: Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was of royal lineage, came to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, in Mizpah. With Ishmael were officers of the king and ten other men. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah.

(Jeremiah 41:41:2) 
Then Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, stood up. They struck Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with a sword and killed him. Gedaliah was the one whom the King of Babylon had appointed over the land.

(Jeremiah 41:41:3) 
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah in Mizpah. He also killed the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.

(Jeremiah 41:41:4) 
On the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and before anyone else knew about it,

(Jeremiah 41:41:5) 
eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. Their beards were shaved, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, as a sign of mourning. They were carrying grain offerings and incense to present at the House of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 41:41:6) 
Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them, pretending to weep as he walked. When he met them, he deceptively said to them, 'Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.'

(Jeremiah 41:41:7) 
When they had come into the middle of the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him, slaughtered them in the middle of the city. Then he threw their bodies into a pit.

(Jeremiah 41:41:8) 
However, ten of those men were found among them. They pleaded with Ishmael, 'Do not kill us! We have hidden stores of barley, wheat, oil, and honey in the fields.' So Ishmael stopped, and he did not kill them along with their companions.

(Jeremiah 41:41:9) 
The pit into which Ishmael threw all the bodies of the men he had killed, in connection with Gedaliah's murder, was the large cistern that King Asa had made long ago, because of King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled it with the slain.

(Jeremiah 41:41:10) 
Ishmael then captured all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah: the king's daughters and everyone else who remained in Mizpah. These were the people whom Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had entrusted to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, took them and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.

(Jeremiah 41:41:11) 
However, Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, heard about all the evil deeds that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had committed.

(Jeremiah 41:41:12) 
So, gathering all their men, they went to fight against Ishmael, son of Nethaniah. They found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.

(Jeremiah 41:41:13) 
When all the people who had been taken by Ishmael saw Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, they rejoiced greatly.

(Jeremiah 41:41:14) 
All the people whom Ishmael had captured in Mizpah turned around. They returned and went over to Johanan, son of Kareah.

(Jeremiah 41:41:15) 
But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, escaped with eight of his men from Johanan, son of Kareah, and fled to the Ammonites.

(Jeremiah 41:41:16) 
So Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, gathered together all the remnant of the people whom Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had taken from Mizpah, after he had murdered Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. These were the strong men of war, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.

(Jeremiah 41:41:17) 
They then set out and settled in Geruth Kimham, which is near Bethlehem. Their plan was to flee and go into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 41:41:18) 
They did this because they feared the Chaldeans. They were afraid of retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the King of Babylon had appointed over the land of Judah, by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah.

(Jeremiah 42:1) 
Then all the commanders of the army, including Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, came near with all the people, from the least important to the greatest.

(Jeremiah 42:2) 
And they said to Jeremiah the prophet: 'Let our prayer be heard before you, and pray for us to God Our Lord. Pray for all of this small remnant of people. We have been left behind—only a few of us from the many—just as you yourself can see with your own eyes.'

(Jeremiah 42:3) 
'And let God Our Lord reveal to us the way in which we ought to go, and the message we should follow.'

(Jeremiah 42:4) 
Jeremiah the prophet said to them: 'I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to God Our Lord on your behalf, according to your words. And every single message that He answers me with, I will tell you. I will not hide anything from you.'

(Jeremiah 42:5) 
And they themselves said to Jeremiah: 'May Our Lord be a true and faithful witness between us. We swear that we will do exactly according to every message that God Our Lord sends you to us with.'

(Jeremiah 42:6) 
'Whether the message is good or bad, we will obey the voice of God Our Lord, to Whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of God Our Lord.'

(Jeremiah 42:7) 
Then, after ten days, the message from Our Lord came to Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 42:8) 
So Jeremiah called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the army who were with him, and all the people, from the least important to the greatest.

(Jeremiah 42:9) 
And he said to them: 'Thus says God Our Lord, the God of Israel, to Whom you sent me to present your prayers before Him...'

(Jeremiah 42:10) 
'If you remain settled in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down. I will plant you and not pluck you up. For I have now relented from the disaster that I brought upon you.'

(Jeremiah 42:11) 
'Do not fear the king of Babylon, whom you are terrified of. Do not be afraid of him, declares Our Lord. For I am with you to save you and to rescue you from his power.'

(Jeremiah 42:12) 
'And I will show you mercy; I will have compassion on you. I will bring you back to your own land.'

(Jeremiah 42:13) 
'But if you say: 'We do not want to remain in this land,' and if you do not listen to the voice of God Our Lord...'

(Jeremiah 42:14) 
'...saying: 'No, not at all! Instead, we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will not see war, and we will not hear the sound of the trumpet, and we will not suffer from famine!' —and so you intend to live there...'

(Jeremiah 42:15) 
'Because of this, now hear the message of Our Lord, you remnant of Judah! Thus says Our Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: 'If you stubbornly set your faces toward entering Egypt, and if you indeed go there to live...'

(Jeremiah 42:16) 
'...then the very sword that you dread will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. And the famine that you fear will cling to you there in Egypt. And there you will die.'

(Jeremiah 42:17) 
'And all the men who stubbornly set their faces toward entering Egypt to live there will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague. Not one of them will survive or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.'

(Jeremiah 42:18) 
'For thus says Our Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Just as My wrath and My indignation poured out over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My indignation pour out over you if you enter Egypt. You will become an object of cursing, astonishment, malediction, and disgrace, and you will never again see this place.'

(Jeremiah 42:19) 
'Our Lord has spoken this message over you, O remnant of Judah: Do not go into Egypt! Know this for certain, because I have solemnly warned you today.'

(Jeremiah 42:20) 
'For you acted deceptively with your own souls when you said: 'Let us pray to God Our Lord for us. According to everything that God Our Lord tells us, so we will do.' And yet now you have acted deceptively with your own souls.'

(Jeremiah 42:21) 
'And you sent me to God Our Lord, saying: 'Pray for us to God Our Lord, and according to everything that God Our Lord tells you, so announce it to us.''

(Jeremiah 42:22) 
'Therefore, know this for certain now: you will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague in the very place where you desired to go and live.'

(Jeremiah 43:1) 
And so it happened, when Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people every single word of the Lord their God—those words for which the Lord their God had sent him on a mission to them—all these very words:

(Jeremiah 43:2) 
Then Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men spoke, saying to Jeremiah: "You are speaking a lie! The Lord our God has not sent you on a mission, saying: 'Do not go to Egypt to live there.'"

(Jeremiah 43:3) 
"Instead, Baruch, the son of Neriah, is inciting you against us, so that you may hand us over into the power of the Chaldeans, to kill us and to carry us away to Babylon."

(Jeremiah 43:4) 
So Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the soldiers, and all the people, did not listen to the voice of the Lord, so that they might remain in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 43:5) 
Instead, Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the soldiers, took all the remaining people of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been exiled, so that they might live in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 43:6) 
They took the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every living person whom Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, had left behind with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. And they also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch, the son of Neriah.

(Jeremiah 43:7) 
And so they entered the land of Egypt because they had not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and they came all the way to Tahpanhes.

(Jeremiah 43:8) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying:

(Jeremiah 43:9) 
"Take large stones in your hand and bury them in the hidden place that is under the brick pavement at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, with the men of Judah watching."

(Jeremiah 43:10) 
"And you are to say to them: 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I myself am sending for and bringing Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant. And I will set his throne upon these very stones which you have hidden, and he will pitch his royal tent over them."'

(Jeremiah 43:11) 
"And when he comes, he will strike the land of Egypt. Those destined for death will face death; those destined for captivity will go into captivity; and those destined for the sword will die by the sword."

(Jeremiah 43:12) 
"And he will set fire to the houses of the gods of Egypt; he will burn them and lead their idols into captivity. He will strip the land of Egypt clean, just as a shepherd thoroughly cleans his garment of clinging dirt or parasites. Then he will depart from there in peace."

(Jeremiah 43:13) 
"And he will break to pieces the sacred pillars of Heliopolis, which are in the land of Egypt, and he will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire."

(Jeremiah 44:44:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt. These were the Jews dwelling in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the region of Pathros. The message stated:

(Jeremiah 44:44:2) 
This is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'You yourselves have seen all the disasters I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, they are desolate ruins today, and no one lives in them anymore.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:3) 
This happened because of the evil deeds they committed, which provoked Me to anger. They did this by going and offering incense to other gods and worshipping them—false gods that neither they, nor you, nor your fathers had ever known.

(Jeremiah 44:44:4) 
Even so, I sent all My servants the prophets to you, again and again, rising early and sending them. I told them to say: 'Do not do this detestable kind of thing that I hate.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:5) 
But they did not listen, nor did they pay any attention. They refused to turn from their evil ways and stop offering incense to other gods.

(Jeremiah 44:44:6) 
So My indignation and My fury were poured out, and they burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. These places became a desolate ruin and a waste, just as you see them this very day.

(Jeremiah 44:44:7) 
Now, therefore, this is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Why are you doing this great evil against your own lives? You are causing men and women, infants and nursing babies to perish from among you in Judah, ensuring that no remnant remains for you.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:8) 
You provoke Me to anger with the works of your own hands by offering sacrifices to false gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to live as foreigners. By doing this, you ensure your own destruction, making yourselves a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth.

(Jeremiah 44:44:9) 
Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives? Have you forgotten your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they all committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

(Jeremiah 44:44:10) 
They have not humbled themselves or been cleansed of their sins even to this very day. They have not feared Me, nor have they walked in My law and in My commandments, which I gave to you and to your fathers.

(Jeremiah 44:44:11) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Behold, I am setting My face against you with resolve to bring disaster and to destroy all Judah.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:12) 
I will take the remnant of Judah who stubbornly set their minds on going into the land of Egypt to live there as foreigners. They will all perish in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and by famine. From the least important to the most important, they will die by sword and famine. They will become a curse, an object of horror, a malediction, and a reproach.

(Jeremiah 44:44:13) 
I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, with the sword, famine, and pestilence.

(Jeremiah 44:44:14) 
There will be no one who escapes and survives from the remnant of Judah who go into the land of Egypt to live there as foreigners. They will not return to the land of Judah, which they desire with all their souls to inhabit. No, they will not return, except for a very few who manage to flee in haste.

(Jeremiah 44:44:15) 
Then all the men who knew that their wives were regularly offering sacrifices to false gods, along with their wives, and all the large crowd of Jews from the land of Judah who were living in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 44:44:16) 
'The message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord—we will not listen to it from you!'

(Jeremiah 44:44:17) 
'No, we will certainly do everything we have vowed to do, which comes out of our own mouths. We will continue to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven—that pagan goddess—and pour out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. When we did this, we were filled with bread, and it was well with us; we experienced no misfortune.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:18) 
'But ever since we stopped offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and we have been consumed by the sword and by famine.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:19) 
'And when we women offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, do you think we make cakes in her image for her worship and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands knowing about it and consenting?' This implies a rhetorical 'No, we do it with their full knowledge and consent.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:20) 
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, to all the men and all the women who had answered him with those words, saying:

(Jeremiah 44:44:21) 
'The sacrifices you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land—did the Lord not remember these things? Did these actions not come into His mind?'

(Jeremiah 44:44:22) 
'And the Lord could no longer tolerate it, because of the wickedness of your deeds and because of the detestable things you committed. Therefore, your land became a desolation, a place of horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant, just as you see it this very day.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:23) 
'Because you offered incense and sinned against the Lord, and you did not obey the voice of the Lord, and you did not walk in His law, in His commandments, and in His testimonies, these disasters have come upon you, just as you see them this very day.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:24) 
Jeremiah then said to all the people and to all the women: 'Hear the message of the Lord, all of you from Judah who are in the land of Egypt!'

(Jeremiah 44:44:25) 
'This is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: "You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and carried out with your hands, saying: 'We will certainly perform our vows which we made, to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.' You have indeed confirmed your vows and have fulfilled them with your actions."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:26) 
'Therefore, hear the message of the Lord, all of you from Judah who live in the land of Egypt: "Behold, I have sworn by My great name," says the Lord, "that My name will no longer be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, no one saying: 'As the Lord God lives!' This means their claim to follow Me will cease."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:27) 
'"Behold, I will watch over them for evil and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by famine until they are utterly destroyed and perish."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:28) 
'And only a very few who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah. Then all the remnant of Judah who entered the land of Egypt to live as foreigners there will know whose word stands firm: My word, or their word.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:29) 
'And this will be a sign to you,' says the Lord, 'that I will punish you in this very place, so that you may know that My words will truly be established against you to bring disaster.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:30) 
'This is what the Lord says: "Behold, I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I handed over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon—his enemy and one who sought his life."'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:1) 
This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah. This happened when Baruch was writing these words from Jeremiah's own dictation into a scroll, during the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, as king of Judah. Jeremiah delivered the message to Baruch, saying:

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:2) 
The Lord God of Israel says this to you, Baruch:

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:3) 
You said, 'Alas for me, I am miserable! The Lord has added more sorrow to my existing pain. I am exhausted from my constant groaning, and I cannot find any peace or rest.'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:4) 
Then Jeremiah will say this to him: The Lord declares, 'Listen! What I have built up, I am now going to tear down. What I have planted, I am now going to uproot. This will happen throughout all the land.'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:5) 
And are you seeking great things and personal honors for yourself? Stop seeking them! For behold, the Lord declares, 'I am about to bring disaster upon all of humanity. But I will allow you to keep your life as a spoil of war, and you will be safe wherever you go.'

(Jeremiah 46:1) 
This is the word of the Lord, which came to Jeremiah the prophet, and it was a message against the nations.

(Jeremiah 46:2) 
It was a message concerning Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt. This army was stationed by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, where Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, defeated them. This battle happened in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.

(Jeremiah 46:3) 
To the Egyptian army, God says: Prepare your large shield and your small buckler, and go forth to war!

(Jeremiah 46:4) 
Harness your horses, O horsemen, and mount them! Stand ready with your helmets, fitted securely, and sharpen your spears. Put on your breastplates, O warriors!

(Jeremiah 46:5) 
But what is this that I see? I see them utterly terrified, turning their backs and fleeing! Their mighty warriors are cut down and have turned to run away. They have not returned because fear has gripped them from every side, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 46:6) 
The swift soldier will not escape, and the strong warrior will not be saved. By the Euphrates River, in the northern lands, they have stumbled and fallen down completely.

(Jeremiah 46:7) 
Who is this that rises up like the Nile River, and whose waters surge like powerful torrents?

(Jeremiah 46:8) 
It is Egypt, rising up like the Nile, and its waters will surge like torrents. Egypt says: 'I will rise up and cover the whole land! I will destroy its cities and all their inhabitants!'

(Jeremiah 46:9) 
Mount your horses, and rejoice in your chariots, O mighty warriors! Go forth, Ethiopians and Libyans, holding your shields! And you, Lydians, hold and direct your arrows!

(Jeremiah 46:10) 
But that day is the day of the Lord, the God of the heavenly armies—a day of vengeance, when He will take retribution on His enemies. The sword will devour until it is completely satisfied, and it will be drunk with their blood. For this is a sacrifice to the Lord, the God of heavenly armies, in the northern land, by the Euphrates River.

(Jeremiah 46:11) 
Go up to Gilead and gather healing balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! You multiply your medicines in vain; there will be no healing for you from this wound.

(Jeremiah 46:12) 
The nations have heard of your shame and disgrace, and your wailing has filled the whole earth. For a mighty warrior has stumbled against another mighty warrior, and both of them have fallen together.

(Jeremiah 46:13) 
This is the word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and his coming to strike the land of Egypt.

(Jeremiah 46:14) 
Announce it in Egypt! Make it heard in Migdol! Let it resound in Memphis and Tahpanhes! Say to them: 'Stand ready and prepare yourselves, for the sword will devour all around you!'

(Jeremiah 46:15) 
Why has your mighty protector fallen? He did not stand, because the Lord Himself overthrew him.

(Jeremiah 46:16) 
Many have fallen, and one man has fallen upon his neighbor. They will say: 'Arise, let us return to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the face of the sword of the oppressor from the north.'

(Jeremiah 46:17) 
Call the name of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: 'A mere boast at its appointed time,' or 'A great noise that quickly passes.'

(Jeremiah 46:18) 
'As I live,' says the King, whose name is the Lord of heavenly armies, 'for as Tabor stands majestic among the mountains, and as Carmel rises by the sea, so surely will he come!'

(Jeremiah 46:19) 
Prepare for yourselves your traveling bags for exile, O dwelling daughter of Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolate wasteland, laid waste and completely uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 46:20) 
Egypt is like a most beautiful heifer, but a stinging gadfly, a deadly attack, will come to her from the north.

(Jeremiah 46:21) 
Even her hired soldiers, who were among her like well-fed calves, have turned and fled together; they could not stand their ground. For the day of their slaughter has come upon them, the very time of their divine punishment.

(Jeremiah 46:22) 
Her voice will sound like the hiss of a serpent fleeing, because the enemy will march with an army and come against her with axes, like those who cut down trees in a forest.

(Jeremiah 46:23) 
They have cut down her forest, says the Lord, a forest that cannot be replenished. For the invaders are more numerous than locusts, and there is no numbering them.

(Jeremiah 46:24) 
The daughter of Egypt is utterly put to shame; she is delivered into the hand of the people from the north.

(Jeremiah 46:25) 
Thus says the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I am about to punish the mighty pride of Alexandria, and Pharaoh, and Egypt itself, and her gods, and her kings — even Pharaoh and all those who trust in him.'

(Jeremiah 46:26) 
And I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. But after these things, Egypt shall be inhabited again, as in the days of old, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 46:27) 
But as for you, My servant Jacob, do not fear, and do not be terrified, O Israel! For behold, I will save you from distant lands, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return and rest and be at peace, and no one shall make him afraid.

(Jeremiah 46:28) 
Therefore, do not fear, O My servant Jacob, says the Lord, for I am with you. For I will utterly destroy all the nations among whom I have scattered you, but I will not utterly destroy you. Instead, I will discipline you with justice, and I will by no means let you go unpunished as if you were innocent.

(Jeremiah 47:1) 
The word of the Lord, which came to Jeremiah the prophet, was a prophecy concerning the Philistines. This prophecy came before Pharaoh attacked the city of Gaza.

(Jeremiah 47:2) 
The Lord declares: "Behold, a great flood of devastation is rising from the north, like an overflowing torrent. It will cover the land and all its inhabitants—the cities and everyone living in them. People will cry out in terror, and all the inhabitants of that land will wail."

(Jeremiah 47:3) 
At the terrifying sound of crashing weapons and the shouts of warring princes, at the loud rumbling of chariot wheels and the furious charge of war chariots, fathers will be too paralyzed by fear and despair to even reach out to save their children. Their hands will be too weak from terror to act.

(Jeremiah 47:4) 
This devastation comes because a destroyer will come against all the Philistines, intending to destroy the cities of Tyre and Sidon, along with all their allied forces. For the Lord will completely annihilate the Philistines, those remaining descendants from the island of Caphtor.

(Jeremiah 47:5) 
Gaza has been stripped bare in mourning and desolation. Ashkelon is utterly silent, and the remaining inhabitants of their coastal plain are likewise silent. The prophet cries out, "How long will you continue to destroy, O razor of the Lord?"

(Jeremiah 47:6) 
"O razor of the Lord, how long will you keep destroying? When will you finally rest? Sheathe yourself! Be still, and be silent!"

(Jeremiah 47:7) 
"How can it possibly rest when the Lord Himself has given it a command? He has directed it against Ashkelon and against all the Philistine coastal regions, and there He has appointed its destructive work."

(Jeremiah 48:1) 
The Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says this concerning Moab: Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste and put to shame! Kiriathaim has been captured; her stronghold is disgraced and has trembled.

(Jeremiah 48:2) 
There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Heshbon. An evil plan has been devised: “Come, let us destroy Moab from being a nation.” Therefore, you will be silenced and pursued by the sword.

(Jeremiah 48:3) 
A voice of crying is heard from Horonaim, a great devastation and destruction.

(Jeremiah 48:4) 
Moab has been crushed. Proclaim her fate to her little ones.

(Jeremiah 48:5) 
With bitter weeping, they ascend the road to Luhith. For on the descent to Horonaim, the enemies have raised a cry of destruction.

(Jeremiah 48:6) 
Flee, save your lives, and you will be like a desert bush in the wilderness.

(Jeremiah 48:7) 
Because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you also will be captured. Chemosh (the god of Moab) will go into exile, along with his priests and his princes.

(Jeremiah 48:8) 
A destroyer will come to every city, and no city will be saved. The valleys will perish, and the plains will be laid waste, for the Lord has spoken it.

(Jeremiah 48:9) 
Give wings to Moab, that she may flee swiftly. Her cities will become desolate and uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 48:10) 
Cursed is he who does the Lord's work deceitfully. And cursed is he who keeps his sword from shedding blood.

(Jeremiah 48:11) 
Moab has been at ease from her youth, resting on her dregs like wine undisturbed. She has not been poured from vessel to vessel, nor has she gone into exile. Therefore, her taste remains in her, and her scent has not changed.

(Jeremiah 48:12) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send men to Moab to tip her over and empty her out. They will empty her vessels and smash her jars.

(Jeremiah 48:13) 
Moab will be put to shame by Chemosh (her god), just as the house of Israel was put to shame by Bethel, their false god in whom they trusted.

(Jeremiah 48:14) 
How can you say, “We are mighty, strong men for battle”?

(Jeremiah 48:15) 
Moab is laid waste, and her cities are attacked. Her chosen young men are slaughtered, says the King, whose name is the Lord of Armies.

(Jeremiah 48:16) 
The destruction of Moab is near, and her calamity hastens swiftly.

(Jeremiah 48:17) 
All who surround Moab, and all who know her name, mourn for her. Say, “How has the strong staff, the glorious scepter, been broken?”

(Jeremiah 48:18) 
Descend from your glory and sit in the dust, Daughter of Dibon. For the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has torn down your strongholds.

(Jeremiah 48:19) 
Stand by the road and look, inhabitant of Aroer. Ask the fleeing one and the one who has escaped, saying, “What has happened?”

(Jeremiah 48:20) 
Moab is disgraced, for she is overcome. Wail and cry out! Proclaim by the Arnon River that Moab is laid waste.

(Jeremiah 48:21) 
And judgment has come upon the land of the plain: upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,

(Jeremiah 48:22) 
And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-Diblathaim,

(Jeremiah 48:23) 
And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-Gamul, and upon Beth-Meon,

(Jeremiah 48:24) 
And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.

(Jeremiah 48:25) 
The horn (symbol of strength) of Moab is cut off, and her arm is broken, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:26) 
Make Moab drunk, for she has defied the Lord. Moab will wallow in her own vomit and become a laughingstock.

(Jeremiah 48:27) 
Was not Israel a laughingstock to you, as if you had found him among thieves? Therefore, because of the words you spoke against him, you will be taken captive.

(Jeremiah 48:28) 
Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, inhabitants of Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest in the highest cleft of a rock.

(Jeremiah 48:29) 
We have heard of Moab's great pride; she is exceedingly proud: her loftiness, her arrogance, her pride, and the haughtiness of her heart.

(Jeremiah 48:30) 
I know her boasting, says the Lord, but her power is not equal to her boast, nor can she accomplish what she claims.

(Jeremiah 48:31) 
Therefore, I will wail over Moab; I will cry out for all of Moab. I will mourn for the men of Kir-Heres (the strong city of Moab).

(Jeremiah 48:32) 
I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah, with the weeping of Jazer. Your branches spread beyond the sea, reaching even to the Sea of Jazer. But a destroyer has fallen upon your harvest and your vintage.

(Jeremiah 48:33) 
Joy and gladness have been taken away from the fruitful fields and from the land of Moab. I have removed wine from the winepresses. No one will tread the grapes and sing the treader's song.

(Jeremiah 48:34) 
From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh and Jahaz, they have raised their voices. From Zoar to Horonaim, they cry like a three-year-old heifer. The waters of Nimrim also will be desolate.

(Jeremiah 48:35) 
And I will put an end to Moab, says the Lord, to anyone who offers sacrifices on the high places and burns incense to her idols.

(Jeremiah 48:36) 
Therefore, my heart will lament for Moab like a flute, and my heart will lament for the men of Kir-Heres like a flute. For the wealth she acquired has perished, even more than she possessed.

(Jeremiah 48:37) 
For every head will be shaved bald, and every beard cut off. On all hands will be gashes, and on every back, sackcloth. These are traditional signs of deep mourning.

(Jeremiah 48:38) 
On all the rooftops of Moab and in her public squares, there will be universal lamentation. For I have crushed Moab like a useless vessel, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:39) 
How she is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned her back in shame! Moab will be an object of scorn and a warning to all around her.

(Jeremiah 48:40) 
Thus says the Lord: Behold, an enemy will swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings over Moab.

(Jeremiah 48:41) 
Kerioth is captured, and the strongholds are taken. The hearts of Moab's warriors on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 48:42) 
And Moab will be destroyed from being a nation, because she defied the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:43) 
Terror, a pit, and a snare are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:44) 
Whoever flees from the terror will fall into the pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:45) 
Those who fled stood helpless in the shadow of Heshbon, because they had no more strength. For fire will come out from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon. It will devour the border regions of Moab and the heads of the boastful people.

(Jeremiah 48:46) 
Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh. For your sons and your daughters have been taken captive.

(Jeremiah 48:47) 
Yet, in the latter days, I will restore the fortunes of Moab, says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment upon Moab.

(Jeremiah 49:1) 
To the descendants of Ammon. This is what the Lord says: Does Israel not have sons? Does Israel not have an heir? If so, why has the false god Milcom, or the king of Ammon, taken possession of the tribe of Gad's land? And why do his people dwell in its cities?

(Jeremiah 49:2) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will cause the sound of battle to be heard against Rabbah, the capital city of the descendants of Ammon. It will become a desolate mound of rubble, and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will truly possess what is its inheritance, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:3) 
Cry out, O Heshbon, for the city of Ai is devastated! Wail, O villages of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth, mourn, and wander through the ruins, for Milcom—your false god and king—will be taken into exile, along with his priests and his princes.

(Jeremiah 49:4) 
Why do you boast about your valleys? Your valley is ruined, O pampered daughter of Ammon! You trusted in your treasures and said, 'Who will attack me?'

(Jeremiah 49:5) 
Behold, I am bringing terror upon you from all those around you, says the Lord, the God of heavenly armies! I will scatter you in all directions, and there will be no one to gather the fleeing survivors.

(Jeremiah 49:6) 
But after these things, I will restore the fortunes of the descendants of Ammon, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:7) 
Concerning Edom. This is what the Lord of heavenly armies says: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman, a place known for its wise men? Has counsel perished from the sons of Esau? Has their wisdom become useless?

(Jeremiah 49:8) 
Flee, turn back, retreat into the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan, an allied nation! For I will bring the destruction of Esau's descendants (Edom) upon him, the time of his punishment.

(Jeremiah 49:9) 
If grape gatherers came to you, wouldn't they leave some gleanings behind? If thieves came by night, they would only steal enough for themselves.

(Jeremiah 49:10) 
But I myself will strip Esau (Edom) bare; I will uncover his hidden places, and he will not be able to hide. Edom is devastated, along with his children, his relatives, and his neighbors; there will be no one left.

(Jeremiah 49:11) 
O Edom, leave your orphans to Me; I will preserve their lives. And your widows will hope in Me, even amidst your destruction.

(Jeremiah 49:12) 
For this is what the Lord says: Behold, those who were not condemned to drink the cup of My wrath will certainly drink it. So then, will you, who are far from innocent, be left unpunished? No, you will not be left; you will surely drink the cup of My judgment.

(Jeremiah 49:13) 
For I have sworn by Myself, says the Lord, that Bozrah, Edom's capital city, will become a desolate ruin, an object of reproach, a wasteland, and a curse. And all its cities will become everlasting desolations.

(Jeremiah 49:14) 
I have heard a report from the Lord, and an envoy has been sent among the nations: 'Gather yourselves, and come against Edom! Let us rise up for battle!'

(Jeremiah 49:15) 
For behold, I have made you small among the nations, despised among men.

(Jeremiah 49:16) 
Your arrogance has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, you who dwell in the clefts of the rocks, like the city of Petra, trying to seize the heights of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:17) 
And Edom will become a desolation; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss in astonishment at its wounds.

(Jeremiah 49:18) 
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities were overthrown, says the Lord, no one will live there, and no human being will dwell in it.

(Jeremiah 49:19) 
Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan River against the strong pastures. For I will suddenly make him rush upon it. And the one whom I choose, him I will appoint over it. For who is like Me? And who will challenge Me? And what shepherd can stand before My face?

(Jeremiah 49:20) 
Therefore, hear the plan of the Lord that He has formed concerning Edom, and His intentions that He has devised concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Surely, the weakest of the flock will drag them away. Surely, their dwellings will be devastated along with them.

(Jeremiah 49:21) 
At the sound of their fall, the earth will tremble. The cry of their destruction will be heard as far as the Red Sea.

(Jeremiah 49:22) 
Behold, he will ascend like an eagle and fly swiftly, spreading his wings over Bozrah. And on that day, the hearts of Edom's bravest warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 49:23) 
Concerning Damascus. Hamath and Arphad are shamed and dismayed, for they have heard terrible news. They are troubled like the restless sea; they cannot be at peace.

(Jeremiah 49:24) 
Damascus is weakened; she has turned to flee. Terror has seized her, and anguish and pains have overcome her, like a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 49:25) 
How is it that such a praiseworthy city, the city of My joy, has been abandoned?

(Jeremiah 49:26) 
Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of battle will be silenced on that day, says the Lord of heavenly armies.

(Jeremiah 49:27) 
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad, a royal title for the kings of Aram-Damascus.

(Jeremiah 49:28) 
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, attacked. This is what the Lord says: 'Rise up, go up against Kedar, and lay waste to the people of the East, the desert tribes.'

(Jeremiah 49:29) 
Their tents and their flocks will be captured; their tent coverings, all their vessels, and their camels will be taken away. Terror will be proclaimed against them from every side.

(Jeremiah 49:30) 
Flee, depart quickly, retreat into the depths, O inhabitants of Hazor, says the Lord! For Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has formed a plan against you, and has devised intentions concerning you.

(Jeremiah 49:31) 
Rise up, and go up against a nation that lives peacefully and securely, says the Lord. They have no gates nor bars; they dwell alone without defenses.

(Jeremiah 49:32) 
Their camels will become plunder, and their great number of livestock will be spoil. And I will scatter them to every wind, those whose hair is trimmed at the temples (a sign of their custom). And from every side, I will bring destruction upon them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:33) 
And Hazor will become a dwelling for jackals, a desolation forever. No one will live there, nor will any human being dwell in it.

(Jeremiah 49:34) 
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying:

(Jeremiah 49:35) 
This is what the Lord of heavenly armies says: 'Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, which is their chief strength.'

(Jeremiah 49:36) 
And I will bring upon Elam four winds from the four corners of the universe; and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will be no nation to which the refugees of Elam will not go.

(Jeremiah 49:37) 
And I will cause Elam to be terrified before their enemies and before those who seek their lives. I will bring evil upon them, the fierceness of My wrath, says the Lord. And I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them.

(Jeremiah 49:38) 
And I will set My throne in Elam, and there I will destroy its kings and princes, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:39) 
But in the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:1) 
This is the message that the Lord spoke concerning Babylon, and concerning the land of the Chaldeans, given through Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 50:2) 
Declare this among the nations; proclaim it loudly and make it known! Set up a signal; preach it openly and do not conceal it! Tell them: 'Babylon has been conquered! Bel, their false god, is shamed! Merodach, their idol, is broken! Her lifeless images are disgraced, their false gods are shattered!'

(Jeremiah 50:3) 
For a nation from the North has marched against Babylon. They will turn her land into a desolate wasteland, and no one will live there, neither people nor animals. Her people will flee and scatter.

(Jeremiah 50:4) 
In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the people of Israel and Judah will come together. They will come weeping, urgently seeking the Lord their God.

(Jeremiah 50:5) 
They will ask the way to Zion, their faces turned towards it with earnest desire. They will come and join themselves to the Lord through an everlasting covenant, one that will never be forgotten or broken.

(Jeremiah 50:6) 
My people have become a lost flock. Their leaders have led them astray, driving them to climb false mountains of sin. They wandered from hill to mountain, forgetting their true resting place and their spiritual home.

(Jeremiah 50:7) 
All who found them devoured them like prey. And their enemies justified themselves, saying: 'We are not guilty, for these people have sinned against the Lord, the very source of justice and glory, and the God whom their ancestors eagerly expected and worshipped.'

(Jeremiah 50:8) 
Flee from Babylon's midst! Get out of the land of the Chaldeans! Lead the way like rams at the head of a flock, guiding others to safety.

(Jeremiah 50:9) 
For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a great alliance of nations from the northern lands. They will prepare for battle against her, and from that very direction, Babylon will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a mighty warrior, striking true and not returning without their kill.

(Jeremiah 50:10) 
And the land of Chaldea will become plunder. All who plunder her will take their fill.

(Jeremiah 50:11) 
Because you rejoiced with shouts of triumph and plundered My chosen inheritance. Because you gamboled like calves in fresh pasture and bellowed like strong bulls in triumph.

(Jeremiah 50:12) 
Your mother—Babylon itself—is utterly shamed, and she who bore you is disgraced. Behold, she will be the lowliest among the nations, a desolate wasteland, without roads, and parched dry.

(Jeremiah 50:13) 
Because of the Lord's burning wrath, Babylon will remain uninhabited and become a complete wasteland. Every person who passes by Babylon will be struck with awe and will hiss in dismay at all her devastating wounds.

(Jeremiah 50:14) 
Form your battle lines all around Babylon, all of you who draw the bow! Fire your arrows at her; do not hold back a single arrow, for she has deeply sinned against the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:15) 
Shout the battle cry against her from every side! Babylon has surrendered! Her cities are overthrown, her mighty walls are torn down, for this is the Lord's vengeance. Take revenge on her; deal with her exactly as she dealt with others.

(Jeremiah 50:16) 
Cut off the sower in Babylon, and the one wielding the sickle at harvest time, so no future crops will grow. Because of the invaders' sword, everyone will flee back to their own people, and each person will escape to their homeland.

(Jeremiah 50:17) 
Israel is a scattered flock, driven away by ferocious lions. First, the king of Assyria devoured them. Then, this last one, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, crushed their bones.

(Jeremiah 50:18) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria.'

(Jeremiah 50:19) 
And I will bring Israel back to their own dwelling place. And they will graze in the fertile lands of Carmel and Bashan, and on Mount Ephraim and Gilead their souls will be fully satisfied.

(Jeremiah 50:20) 
In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the iniquity of Israel will be sought out, but none will be found; the sin of Judah will be sought, but it will not be found. For I will graciously forgive those whom I have preserved.

(Jeremiah 50:21) 
Go up against the land of Merathaim—a land of double rebellion—and against the inhabitants of Pekod—a land of punishment. Completely destroy those who resist, and put to death those who follow them. Devote everything to utter destruction, says the Lord. Do everything I have commanded you.

(Jeremiah 50:22) 
The sound of battle echoes across the land, and the destruction is immense.

(Jeremiah 50:23) 
How completely broken and shattered is the hammer that struck down the whole earth—Babylon! How Babylon has become a wasteland among the nations!

(Jeremiah 50:24) 
I have set a trap for you, Babylon, and you are caught, completely unaware! You are discovered and seized, because you dared to defy the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:25) 
The Lord has opened His armory and brought forth the weapons of His wrath. For this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Jeremiah 50:26) 
Come against her from every border; break open her granaries until her goods lie in heaps. And utterly destroy, leaving no survivors; let nothing remain.

(Jeremiah 50:27) 
Slay all her mighty warriors; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come—the time of their destined punishment!

(Jeremiah 50:28) 
Listen! The sound of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon, they come to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God—the vengeance for His sacred Temple.

(Jeremiah 50:29) 
Summon many archers against Babylon, all you who draw the bow! Surround her completely; let no one escape! Repay her for her deeds; do to her exactly as she has done to others, because she has acted with arrogant pride against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.

(Jeremiah 50:30) 
Therefore, her young warriors will fall in her streets. And all her fighting men will be utterly silenced on that day, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:31) 
Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one! says the Lord God of hosts. For your day has come—the time of your deserved punishment.

(Jeremiah 50:32) 
And that arrogant one will stumble and fall, with no one to help her rise again. And I will kindle a fire in Babylon's cities, and it will consume everything around her.

(Jeremiah 50:33) 
This is what the Lord of hosts says: The people of Israel and Judah have both suffered severe oppression. And all who took them captive held them tightly, refusing to release them.

(Jeremiah 50:34) 
Their Redeemer is mighty; the Lord of hosts is His name. He will vigorously defend their cause in judgment, so that He may bring chaos upon the earth and shake the inhabitants of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 50:35) 
A sword of judgment hangs over the Chaldeans! says the Lord. It hangs over the inhabitants of Babylon, over her princes, and over her wise men.

(Jeremiah 50:36) 
A sword upon her diviners, and they will go mad with terror. A sword upon her mighty warriors, and they will be struck with fear.

(Jeremiah 50:37) 
A sword upon her warhorses and upon her chariots, and upon all the foreign mercenaries within her, and they will become as weak as women. A sword upon her treasures, and they will be plundered.

(Jeremiah 50:38) 
A drought upon her rivers and canals, and they will be dried up. Because it is a land full of carved images, and its people are driven to madness by their false gods.

(Jeremiah 50:39) 
Therefore, desert creatures will dwell there with howling animals, and ostriches will make their home in it. It will never again be inhabited, nor will it be rebuilt for all future generations.

(Jeremiah 50:40) 
Just as the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the Lord, no man will live there, and no human being will settle in it.

(Jeremiah 50:41) 
Behold, a people is coming from the North—a great nation, and many kings will rise up from the far ends of the earth.

(Jeremiah 50:42) 
They seize bow and shield for battle. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their battle cries will roar like the surging sea, and they will advance on horses. They are arrayed for battle like a mighty warrior, against you, O daughter Babylon.

(Jeremiah 50:43) 
The king of Babylon has heard reports of them, and his hands have gone limp with fear. Anguish has gripped him, like the pain of a woman giving birth.

(Jeremiah 50:44) 
Behold, like a lion rising from the thickets of the Jordan, he will come against Babylon's strong and beautiful pastures. For I will suddenly make him rush against her. And who is the chosen one whom I will appoint to rule over her? For who is truly like Me? And who can stand against Me? And what shepherd, what ruler, can resist My face?

(Jeremiah 50:45) 
Therefore, listen to the plan of the Lord that He has formed against Babylon, and the intentions He has conceived concerning the land of the Chaldeans. Even the smallest of the flock, the weakest nations, will drag them away captive. Surely, their very dwelling place will be utterly destroyed along with them.

(Jeremiah 50:46) 
At the sound of Babylon's capture, the entire earth will tremble, and her cries will be heard among all the nations.

(Jeremiah 51:51:1) 
The Lord says this: "Pay attention! I am stirring up against Babylon and against its inhabitants—those living deep within its core, whom I have specifically chosen to be at the center of My punitive will—a wind that brings destruction and plague."

(Jeremiah 51:51:2) 
I will send against Babylon destroyers, who will winnow it and clear out its land, much like a farmer separates chaff from grain; because enemies will come against it from every direction on the day of its calamity.

(Jeremiah 51:51:3) 
Let the archer not prepare his bow; let him not rise up in his armor to fight. Do not spare its young men; put to death all its warriors.

(Jeremiah 51:51:4) 
The slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those wounded to death will lie in its streets.

(Jeremiah 51:51:5) 
For Israel and Judah have not been abandoned by their God, the Lord of armies, even though their own land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.

(Jeremiah 51:51:6) 
Flee from the midst of Babylon, and let each one save his own life! Do not remain silent about her wickedness, because this is the time of the Lord's vengeance; He Himself will repay her what she deserves.

(Jeremiah 51:51:7) 
Babylon was like a golden cup in the Lord's hand, intoxicating the whole earth. The nations drank of her wine, and for this reason, they were driven mad.

(Jeremiah 51:51:8) 
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and is shattered! Wail over her; get balm for her pain, in case she can still be healed.

(Jeremiah 51:51:9) 
"We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not healed. Let us abandon her, and let each one go to his own country; for her judgment has reached even to the skies, and is lifted up even to the clouds."

(Jeremiah 51:51:10) 
The Lord has brought forth our vindication. Come, let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.

(Jeremiah 51:51:11) 
Sharpen your arrows! Fill your quivers! The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes against Babylon to destroy it, for this is the Lord's vengeance—the vengeance for His Temple.

(Jeremiah 51:51:12) 
Raise a standard against the walls of Babylon! Increase the guard! Set watchmen! Prepare ambushes! For the Lord has planned and has done what He declared against the inhabitants of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 51:51:13) 
O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures! Your end has come, the measure of your greed is full.

(Jeremiah 51:51:14) 
The Lord of armies has sworn: "I will surely fill you with men like a swarm of locusts, and a shout of triumph will be raised over you."

(Jeremiah 51:51:15) 
It is He who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding He stretched out the skies and the rest of the universe.

(Jeremiah 51:51:16) 
At the sound of His voice, He brings forth the abundance of waters in the sky; He makes the clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He creates lightning with the rain, and He brings forth the wind from His storehouses.

(Jeremiah 51:51:17) 
Every human is proven foolish in their knowledge; every craftsman of idols is put to shame by his carved image; for his idol is a mere empty breath, and there is no true spirit or life within them.

(Jeremiah 51:51:18) 
They are useless, and a work worthy of ridicule. In the time of their judgment, they will perish completely.

(Jeremiah 51:51:19) 
The portion of Jacob is not like these empty idols; for He who formed all things, He is Jacob's God, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance. The Lord of armies is His name.

(Jeremiah 51:51:20) 
"You, O Babylon, are My hammer and My weapons of war. With you, I will smash nations; with you, I will destroy kingdoms.

(Jeremiah 51:51:21) 
With you, I will smash the horse and its rider; with you, I will smash the chariot and its driver.

(Jeremiah 51:51:22) 
With you, I will smash man and woman; with you, I will smash old and young; with you, I will smash the young man and the virgin.

(Jeremiah 51:51:23) 
With you, I will smash the shepherd and his flock; with you, I will smash the farmer and his team of oxen; with you, I will smash governors and rulers.

(Jeremiah 51:51:24) 
And I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they inflicted upon Zion. You will see it with your own eyes," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:25) 
Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain—a great power that corrupts the whole earth! declares the Lord. I will stretch out My hand against you, and I will roll you down from the rocks, and I will make you a burnt-out mountain.

(Jeremiah 51:51:26) 
They will not take from you even a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation. Instead, you will be eternal desolation, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:27) 
Raise a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Declare the nations holy for war against her! Summon against her the kings of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz! Appoint a commander over her! Bring up cavalry like a swarm of bristly locusts!

(Jeremiah 51:51:28) 
Prepare the nations against her for war: the kings of Media, their governors, all the rulers of all their lands, and their entire dominion.

(Jeremiah 51:51:29) 
Then the earth will quake and tremble, because the Lord's purpose against Babylon has awakened—to make the land of Babylon desolate and uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 51:51:30) 
The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength has withered, and they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire, her bars are broken.

(Jeremiah 51:51:31) 
Runner will come to runner, and messenger to messenger, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured from one end to the other.

(Jeremiah 51:51:32) 
The river crossings have been seized, and the marshes are burned with fire, and the warriors are terrified and in disarray.

(Jeremiah 51:51:33) 
For thus says the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor; the time for her to be trodden down is near. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest—her destruction—will come."

(Jeremiah 51:51:34) 
"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has devoured me, he has crushed me. He has made me like an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a dragon, filled his belly with my delicacies, and then cast me aside."

(Jeremiah 51:51:35) 
The people of Zion will say: "May the injustice done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon!" And Jerusalem will say: "May my shed blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!"

(Jeremiah 51:51:36) 
Therefore, the Lord says this: "Behold, I will plead your case, and I will take vengeance on your behalf. I will dry up her sea—meaning her power and resources—and make her spring of fresh water run dry."

(Jeremiah 51:51:37) 
And Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a dwelling place for jackals, an object of horror and hissing, because no one will inhabit it.

(Jeremiah 51:51:38) 
They will roar together like lions; they will growl like lion cubs.

(Jeremiah 51:51:39) 
In their heat, I will give them their drinks; I will make them drunk so that they become sluggish and sleep an eternal sleep, and do not awaken," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:40) 
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with goats to be sacrificed.

(Jeremiah 51:51:41) 
How has Sheshach—a symbolic name for Babylon—been captured? How has the renown of the whole earth been seized? How has Babylon become an object of horror among the nations?

(Jeremiah 51:51:42) 
The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves, symbolizing overwhelming destruction.

(Jeremiah 51:51:43) 
Her cities have become a desolation, a land uninhabitable and deserted; a land where no one dwells, and no human being passes through it.

(Jeremiah 51:51:44) 
And I will punish Bel, the chief idol of Babylon, and I will make him vomit out what he has swallowed from his mouth. Nations will no longer flow to him in worship, and even the wall of Babylon will fall.

(Jeremiah 51:51:45) 
Go out from her midst, My people! Let each one save his own life from the fierce anger of the Lord!

(Jeremiah 51:51:46) 
And lest your heart should faint, and you should be afraid of the rumor that will be heard in the land—when a rumor comes in one year, and after that, in another year, another rumor, bringing injustice in the land, and ruler rising against ruler.

(Jeremiah 51:51:47) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming when I will punish the carved images of Babylon, and all her land will be put to shame, and all her slain will fall in her midst.

(Jeremiah 51:51:48) 
And the universe and the earth, and all that is in them, will sing for joy over Babylon, because destroyers will come against her from the north," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:49) 
Just as Babylon caused the slain to fall in Israel, so too in Babylon will the slain fall throughout all the earth.

(Jeremiah 51:51:50) 
You who have escaped the sword, come, do not stand still! Remember the Lord from afar, and let Jerusalem rise in your hearts.

(Jeremiah 51:51:51) 
"We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach; dishonor has covered our faces, for foreigners have come against the holy places of the Lord's house."

(Jeremiah 51:51:52) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will punish her carved images, and throughout all her land, the wounded will groan.

(Jeremiah 51:51:53) 
Even if Babylon should ascend to the very sky, and establish her strength firmly in the heights, from Me will come destroyers against her," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:54) 
A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!

(Jeremiah 51:51:55) 
For the Lord will devastate Babylon and destroy its great voice—the clamor of its people. Its waves will roar like many waters, giving forth the sound of their tumult.

(Jeremiah 51:51:56) 
Because a destroyer comes upon her, that is, upon Babylon. Her mighty warriors will be captured, and their bows will be shattered; for the Lord is a strong avenger, surely rendering recompense.

(Jeremiah 51:51:57) 
"I will make her princes drunk, along with her wise men, her governors, her rulers, and her mighty warriors. They will sleep an eternal sleep and not awaken," says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies.

(Jeremiah 51:51:58) 
Thus says the Lord of armies: "The wide walls of Babylon will be utterly broken down, and her high gates will be burned with fire. The peoples have toiled in vain, and the nations have wearied themselves only for the fire."

(Jeremiah 51:51:59) 
This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah, the son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, when Seraiah went with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the chief officer tasked with delivering prophetic messages.

(Jeremiah 51:51:60) 
Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the evil that was to come upon Babylon—all these words that are written against Babylon.

(Jeremiah 51:51:61) 
Jeremiah then said to Seraiah: "When you arrive in Babylon, and you see it, and you have read all these words—

(Jeremiah 51:51:62) 
you are to say: 'O Lord, You Yourself have spoken concerning this place, that You would destroy it, so that there will be no one living in it, neither man nor beast, and it will be an eternal desolation.'

(Jeremiah 51:51:63) 
And when you have finished reading this scroll, you are to tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.

(Jeremiah 51:51:64) 
And you are to say: 'Thus shall Babylon be submerged, and it will not rise from the face of the affliction that I will bring upon it, and it will be utterly broken.' Here ends the words of Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 52:1) 
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.

(Jeremiah 52:2) 
And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done everything.

(Jeremiah 52:3) 
Because of the Lord's anger, these events happened to Jerusalem and Judah, until He cast them out of His sight. Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:4) 
In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, in the tenth month on the tenth day of that month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem with all his army. They surrounded the city and built siege works all around it.

(Jeremiah 52:5) 
The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah's reign.

(Jeremiah 52:6) 
In the fourth month, on the ninth day of that month, the famine in the city became severe, and there was no bread left for the people of the land.

(Jeremiah 52:7) 
The city wall was breached, and all the soldiers fled. They went out of the city by night through the gate between the two walls, which led to the king's garden. The Chaldeans were besieging the city all around. Zedekiah proceeded along the road through the desert plain.

(Jeremiah 52:8) 
The Chaldean army pursued the king and captured Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All the soldiers who were with him were scattered from him.

(Jeremiah 52:9) 
So they brought the captured king to the king of Babylon at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath. There, the king of Babylon passed judgment on him.

(Jeremiah 52:10) 
The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his very eyes. He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.

(Jeremiah 52:11) 
Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze chains. The king of Babylon brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.

(Jeremiah 52:12) 
In the fifth month, on the tenth day of that month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:13) 
And he burned the Lord's Temple, the king's palace, all the houses in Jerusalem, and every great house, burning them all with fire.

(Jeremiah 52:14) 
The entire Chaldean army, who were with the commander of the imperial guard, tore down all the walls around Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:15) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away into exile some of the poorest people, the remaining common people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

(Jeremiah 52:16) 
But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.

(Jeremiah 52:17) 
The Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the Lord's Temple, along with the bronze stands and the great bronze basin called 'the Sea' that was in the Lord's Temple. They carried all that bronze to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:18) 
They also took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, bowls, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in the Temple service.

(Jeremiah 52:19) 
Furthermore, the commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, incense burners, pitchers, bowls, lampstands, dishes, and cups—whatever was gold, he took as gold; and whatever was silver, he took as silver.

(Jeremiah 52:20) 
There were two pillars, one great basin, and twelve bronze stands that King Solomon had made for the Lord's Temple. The weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.

(Jeremiah 52:21) 
As for the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits (about twenty-seven feet), and a cord of twelve cubits (about eighteen feet) went around it. Its thickness was four fingers (about three inches), and it was hollow inside.

(Jeremiah 52:22) 
There were bronze capitals on top of each pillar. The height of one capital was five cubits (about seven and a half feet), with a network of bronze pomegranates all around the capitals—all made of bronze. The second pillar was similar, also with pomegranates.

(Jeremiah 52:23) 
There were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down, and all the pomegranates on the network amounted to one hundred, surrounding it on all sides.

(Jeremiah 52:24) 
The commander of the imperial guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

(Jeremiah 52:25) 
From the city, he took one eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers. He also took seven men from those who stood near the king, who were found in the city. He took the commander of the army's scribe, who was responsible for conscripting the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.

(Jeremiah 52:26) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

(Jeremiah 52:27) 
The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah, in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away into exile from their own land.

(Jeremiah 52:28) 
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews.

(Jeremiah 52:29) 
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight thousand three hundred thirty-two people from Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:30) 
In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away seven hundred forty-five Jews. All the people carried into exile totaled four thousand six hundred.

(Jeremiah 52:31) 
It came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of that month, that Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and brought him out of prison.

(Jeremiah 52:32) 
He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a seat of honor higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:33) 
Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he ate regularly in the king's presence for all the days of his life.

(Jeremiah 52:34) 
And as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a set amount each day, until the day of his death.

(Lamentations 1:1) 
How lonely she now sits, the city that was once full of so many people!
She has become like a widow, she who was the sovereign lady over many nations.
She who ruled among the provinces is now forced to pay tribute.

(Lamentations 1:2) 
She weeps bitterly throughout the night, and her tears stream down her cheeks.
Among all those who once loved her, there is no one to comfort her.
All her former friends have scorned her and have now become her enemies.

(Lamentations 1:3) 
Judah has been forced to go into exile because of her great affliction and her overwhelming servitude.
She now lives among foreign nations, but she finds no rest there.
All of her persecutors have overtaken her in these times of great distress.

(Lamentations 1:4) 
The roads leading to Sion are in mourning because there is no one coming to her solemn feasts anymore.
All of her city gates are destroyed, and her priests are groaning.
Her young women are in squalor, and Sion herself is oppressed with utter bitterness.

(Lamentations 1:5) 
Her enemies have become her masters, and her foes have become rich.
This has happened because the Lord Himself has brought judgment upon her due to the multitude of her sins.
Her little children have been led away into captivity before the very eyes of their tormentors.

(Lamentations 1:6) 
From the Daughter of Sion, all her beauty has now departed.
Her princes have become like rams who cannot find any pasture.
They have gone away, utterly without strength, before the face of their pursuers.

(Lamentations 1:7) 
Jerusalem now remembers the days of her affliction and her transgressions against God.
She remembers all the precious things she had from ancient times.
She remembers when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and there was no one to help them.
Her enemies saw her and openly mocked her Sabbaths, which she could no longer keep.

(Lamentations 1:8) 
Jerusalem has sinned terribly, which is why she has become unstable and wandering.
All those who used to glorify her now scorn her, because they have seen her disgrace.
She herself is groaning and has turned away in shame.

(Lamentations 1:9) 
Her defilement is on her very feet, and she did not remember what her end would be.
She has been violently cast down, having no one to comfort her.
O Lord, look upon my affliction, for the enemy has risen up against me.

(Lamentations 1:10) 
The enemy has stretched out his hand to seize all of her most precious things.
For she has seen the Gentiles enter her sanctuary,
—those very nations whom You had commanded should never enter into Your holy assembly.

(Lamentations 1:11) 
All of her people are now groaning as they search for bread.
They have given up all their precious possessions in exchange for food, just to keep themselves alive.
O Lord, look and consider this, for I have become worthless.

(Lamentations 1:12) 
O, all you who pass by on this road, pay attention and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow!
For the Lord has afflicted me, as He promised, on the very day of His fierce and burning anger.

(Lamentations 1:13) 
From His exalted dwelling, God sent fire down into my very bones, and He chastised me.
He spread a net for my feet and made me stumble backward.
He has made me desolate, utterly consumed with sorrow all the day long.

(Lamentations 1:14) 
The heavy yoke of my sins has been fastened upon me; they have been intertwined by His hand and placed upon my neck.
My strength has completely failed.
The Lord has delivered me into a hand from which I will never be able to rise.

(Lamentations 1:15) 
The Lord has taken away all my mighty men from among me.
He has called for a specific time to come against me, so that He might crush my valiant men.
The Lord has trodden the winepress upon the virgin daughter of Judah, crushing her utterly.

(Lamentations 1:16) 
Therefore, I weep continuously, and my eyes pour out tears.
For the Comforter, who could restore my soul, has gone far from me.
My children have become desolate because the enemy has utterly prevailed.

(Lamentations 1:17) 
Sion stretches out her hands for help, but there is no one to comfort her.
The Lord has commanded her enemies to surround Jacob, so they are all around her.
Jerusalem has become like an unclean woman among them, utterly despised.

(Lamentations 1:18) 
The Lord is truly just in His judgment, for I have provoked His divine will to anger.
Listen, I beg you, all peoples, and see my great sorrow!
My young women and my young men have been led away into captivity.

(Lamentations 1:19) 
I called upon my friends, but they themselves deceived me.
My priests and my elders perished within the city,
because they were desperately searching for food to keep themselves alive.

(Lamentations 1:20) 
O Lord, look upon me, for I am in severe distress.
My innermost being is in turmoil; my heart is utterly overturned within me, for I am filled with overwhelming bitterness.
Outside the city, the sword has brought death, and inside my home, it feels just like death.

(Lamentations 1:21) 
They have heard that I am groaning, and there is no one to comfort me.
All my enemies have heard of my misfortune, and they rejoiced that You, O God, have done this.
You have brought their day of reckoning, and they will become just like me in their suffering.

(Lamentations 1:22) 
Let all their wickedness come before Your sight, O God.
And punish them just as You have punished me, because of all my many sins.
For my groans are many, and my heart is filled with sorrow.

(Lamentations 2:1) 
How the Lord, in His fury, has covered the Daughter of Zion with darkness, casting down from its exalted position to the ground the renown of Israel! In the day of His anger, He did not even remember His holy footstool, the Temple.

(Lamentations 2:2) 
The Lord has cast down and shown no mercy to all the glorious places of Jacob. In His fury, He destroyed the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah, leveling them to the ground. He has defiled both the kingdom and its leaders.

(Lamentations 2:3) 
In the blazing anger of His fury, He broke every source of Israel's strength. He withdrew His powerful right hand from the sight of the enemy, and He set Jacob ablaze like a devouring fire that consumed everything around it.

(Lamentations 2:4) 
Like an enemy, He drew His bow. He stood firm with His right hand like an adversary, and He killed everything beautiful to behold in the dwellings of Zion. He poured out His indignation like a raging fire.

(Lamentations 2:5) 
The Lord acted like an enemy; He utterly destroyed Israel. He destroyed all its walls and demolished its strongholds. And in Zion, He brought a time of mourning for both its outer walls and its inner ramparts.

(Lamentations 2:6) 
He has torn down His protective hedge as one would a garden wall. He has demolished His own dwelling place, the Temple. The Lord has made all the feast days and Sabbaths in Zion to cease. And in His fierce indignation, He has rejected both king and priest.

(Lamentations 2:7) 
The Lord has rejected His own altar. He has cursed His sanctuary, delivering the walls of its towers into the hands of the enemy. The enemies now shout in the House of the Lord, as if it were a feast day of their own celebration.

(Lamentations 2:8) 
The Lord planned to tear down the wall of the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out His measuring line for destruction and did not withdraw His hand from the task until it was complete. The outer wall mourned, and the city wall was utterly destroyed with it.

(Lamentations 2:9) 
Its gates are buried deep in the ground. He broke and shattered all its defensive bars. Its king and its princes are now exiled among the foreign nations. There is no Law of God observed, and its prophets no longer receive a vision from the Lord.

(Lamentations 2:10) 
The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit silently on the ground. They have sprinkled ashes on their heads and clothed themselves in sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground in despair.

(Lamentations 2:11) 
My eyes are consumed with weeping, and my inner being is deeply troubled. My life essence feels poured out onto the ground because of the utter destruction of the Daughter of my people, as I see little children and infants fainting in the streets of the city.

(Lamentations 2:12) 
The children cried to their mothers, 'Where is bread and wine?' as they fainted like wounded soldiers in the city streets, and breathed their last breath in their mothers' arms.

(Lamentations 2:13) 
To what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, or how can I comfort you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? For your destruction is as vast as the sea; who can possibly heal you?

(Lamentations 2:14) 
Your prophets saw for you false and foolish visions. They did not expose your iniquity to provoke you to repentance. Instead, they saw for you false burdens and misleading delusions.

(Lamentations 2:15) 
All who pass by the way clap their hands in scorn over you. They hiss and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem, saying, 'Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?'

(Lamentations 2:16) 
All your enemies open their mouths wide against you. They hiss and gnash their teeth, saying, 'We have utterly devoured her! Behold, this is the day we have waited for; we have found it, we have seen it with our own eyes!'

(Lamentations 2:17) 
The Lord has done what He purposed; He has fulfilled the word He spoke from ancient days. He has destroyed without sparing, and He has made your enemy rejoice over you. He has exalted the strength of your adversaries.

(Lamentations 2:18) 
Their hearts cry out to the Lord over the walls of the Daughter of Zion: 'Let your tears flow like a torrent day and night. Do not give yourself any rest, and let the stream of your tears never cease!'

(Lamentations 2:19) 
Arise! Cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches. Pour out your heart like water before the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to Him for the lives of your little children, who are fainting from hunger at every street corner.

(Lamentations 2:20) 
Look, O Lord, and consider how You have utterly ravaged us. Shall women really eat their own children, the fruit of their own bodies? Shall priest and prophet be put to death in the very sanctuary of the Lord?

(Lamentations 2:21) 
The young child and the old man lie on the ground, lifeless. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of Your fury; You struck them down without any mercy.

(Lamentations 2:22) 
As if for a solemn feast day, You called forth my terrors from every side. In the day of the Lord's fury, no one escaped or was left alive. Those children whom I had lovingly raised and nourished, my enemy has utterly consumed them all.

(Lamentations 3:1) 
I am the man who has seen my own utter misery, inflicted by the rod of God's righteous anger.

(Lamentations 3:2) 
God has led me and brought me into spiritual darkness, and not into His light.

(Lamentations 3:3) 
God has continually turned His hand against me, all day long.

(Lamentations 3:4) 
He has stripped away my skin and my flesh, and broken my bones, leaving me utterly vulnerable.

(Lamentations 3:5) 
He has built a wall around me, and surrounded me with bitter affliction and great suffering.

(Lamentations 3:6) 
He has placed me in the deepest darkness, like those who have been dead for a long time.

(Lamentations 3:7) 
He has walled me in completely so that I cannot escape; He has made my chains heavy and unbreakable.

(Lamentations 3:8) 
And even when I cry out and pray for help, God has shut out my prayers.

(Lamentations 3:9) 
He has blocked my paths with massive, squared stones, and made my ways impossible to navigate.

(Lamentations 3:10) 
God has become to me like a bear lying in ambush, or a lion hidden in wait.

(Lamentations 3:11) 
He has completely overturned my life's paths and broken me; He has left me utterly desolate and alone.

(Lamentations 3:12) 
He has drawn His bow and set me up as a target for His arrow.

(Lamentations 3:13) 
He has shot the arrows from His quiver deep into my vital organs.

(Lamentations 3:14) 
I have become the object of mockery for all my own people, and their song of scorn all day long.

(Lamentations 3:15) 
God has filled me with bitter experiences; He has made me drunk with the bitter poison of suffering.

(Lamentations 3:16) 
He has broken my teeth on gravel; He has made me eat ashes.

(Lamentations 3:17) 
My soul has been driven far away from any peace, and I have forgotten what good things feel like.

(Lamentations 3:18) 
And I said to myself, "My strength is completely gone, and all my hope from the Lord has vanished."

(Lamentations 3:19) 
Remember my profound suffering and my homeless wandering, the bitter poison and the gall of it all.

(Lamentations 3:20) 
I will always remember these things, and my soul will waste away within me because of it.

(Lamentations 3:21) 
But when I bring this to my mind, I then find strength.

(Lamentations 3:22) 
It is because of the Lord’s mercies that we are not completely destroyed; His compassions never fail.

(Lamentations 3:23) 
They are new every morning, constantly renewed; indeed, Your faithfulness is great.

(Lamentations 3:24) 
My soul proclaims, "The Lord is my portion and inheritance, therefore I will wait in hope for Him."

(Lamentations 3:25) 
The Lord is truly good to those who wait for Him, to the soul that earnestly seeks Him.

(Lamentations 3:26) 
It is good to quietly wait and hope for the saving help of God.

(Lamentations 3:27) 
It is good for a person to bear the burden of suffering from their youth.

(Lamentations 3:28) 
The one who bears suffering will sit alone and remain silent, because he has accepted this burden upon himself.

(Lamentations 3:29) 
He will put his mouth in the dust, prostrating himself in utter humility, if by chance there is still hope.

(Lamentations 3:30) 
He will offer his cheek to the one who strikes him; he will allow himself to be filled with insults and shame.

(Lamentations 3:31) 
For the Lord will not cast off His people forever.

(Lamentations 3:32) 
For even if He has cast them away, He will show mercy according to the abundance of His compassion.

(Lamentations 3:33) 
For God does not willingly humble or cast away the children of mankind from His heart.

(Lamentations 3:34) 
He takes no pleasure in seeing those bound on earth crushed underfoot by oppressors.

(Lamentations 3:35) 
Nor does He approve when a person's justice is subverted in the presence of the Most High God.

(Lamentations 3:36) 
Nor does the Lord approve when a man is defrauded in his legal judgment.

(Lamentations 3:37) 
Who is it that has spoken a command and it came to be, when the Lord Himself had not commanded it?

(Lamentations 3:38) 
Does not both evil and good proceed from the mouth of the Most High God?

(Lamentations 3:39) 
Why then should any living person murmur or complain, especially a man who suffers for his own sins?

(Lamentations 3:40) 
Let us carefully examine our ways, and search our consciences, and then turn back to the Lord.

(Lamentations 3:41) 
Let us lift up our hearts, not just our hands, in prayer to the Lord who dwells in the spiritual heavens.

(Lamentations 3:42) 
We have acted wickedly and defiantly, and provoked You to anger; because of this, You have not spared us.

(Lamentations 3:43) 
You have covered Yourself with fury and pursued us; You have slain us without mercy.

(Lamentations 3:44) 
You have covered Yourself with a thick cloud so that no prayer can pass through to You.

(Lamentations 3:45) 
You have made us an object of scorn and contempt in the midst of the nations.

(Lamentations 3:46) 
All of our enemies have opened their mouths against us in derision.

(Lamentations 3:47) 
A terrifying report and destruction have come upon us; calamity and utter ruin.

(Lamentations 3:48) 
My eyes pour out rivers of tears because of the utter destruction of the daughter of my people.

(Lamentations 3:49) 
My eyes will continue to pour out tears and will not stop, because there is no rest or relief from this suffering.

(Lamentations 3:50) 
Until the Lord looks down and sees from His dwelling in the spiritual heavens.

(Lamentations 3:51) 
The sight of my city's suffering has deeply grieved my soul, because of all the people, the daughters of my city.

(Lamentations 3:52) 
My enemies have hunted me down like a bird, without any cause or reason.

(Lamentations 3:53) 
They trapped me alive in a pit, and placed a large stone over me.

(Lamentations 3:54) 
The waters closed over my head, and I said, "We are utterly lost and destroyed!"

(Lamentations 3:55) 
I called upon Your Holy Name, O Lord, from the lowest, most desperate pit.

(Lamentations 3:56) 
You heard my voice calling out; do not turn away Your ear from my groaning and my cries.

(Lamentations 3:57) 
You came near to me on the very day I called upon You; You said, "Do not be afraid."

(Lamentations 3:58) 
You have defended the cause of my soul, O Lord; You have redeemed my very life.

(Lamentations 3:59) 
You have seen, O Lord, the injustice done to me; now, give judgment on my behalf.

(Lamentations 3:60) 
You have seen all their acts of vengeance, and all their evil thoughts against me.

(Lamentations 3:61) 
You have heard their insults, O Lord, and all their malicious plots against me.

(Lamentations 3:62) 
You know the hostile words of those who rise up against me, and their wicked thoughts against me all day long.

(Lamentations 3:63) 
Observe their every action, whether they are sitting or rising; I am the constant subject of their mocking songs.

(Lamentations 3:64) 
You will repay them, O Lord, according to the evil works of their own hands.

(Lamentations 3:65) 
You will give them hardness of heart as a punishment, and Your curse will be upon them.

(Lamentations 3:66) 
You will pursue them in Your wrath and utterly destroy them under Your created universe, O Lord.

(Lamentations 4:1) 
How the gold has grown dim! How the finest color has changed! The precious stones of the sanctuary are scattered at the head of every street, desecrated and lost.

(Lamentations 4:2) 
The glorious sons of Sion, once adorned in the finest gold, how they are now esteemed as mere earthen vessels, like common pottery made by a potter's hands!

(Lamentations 4:3) 
Even the wild animals, like jackals, bare their breasts and nurse their young. But the daughter of my people, out of desperation, has become cruel, like an ostrich in the desert that abandons its eggs.

(Lamentations 4:4) 
The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of its mouth from unbearable thirst. Little children beg for bread, but there is no one to break it and give it to them.

(Lamentations 4:5) 
Those who used to eat luxuriously have perished in the streets from hunger. Those who were brought up in scarlet robes now embrace dung heaps out of sheer starvation.

(Lamentations 4:6) 
The punishment for the iniquity of the daughter of my people has become greater and more prolonged than the sin of Sodom. Sodom was overthrown in a moment, its destruction was swift and complete, with no human hands laying hold of it for further torment.

(Lamentations 4:7) 
Her Nazirites, who once were purer than snow and whiter than milk, more ruddy than ancient ivory, and more beautiful than sapphires,

(Lamentations 4:8) 
now have faces darker than charcoal. They are not recognized in their own streets. Their skin clings to their bones, shriveled and become dry like wood.

(Lamentations 4:9) 
Those killed by the sword were better off than those killed by famine, for the latter wasted away, consumed by the utter barrenness of the land.

(Lamentations 4:10) 
The hands of even compassionate women have cooked their own children. These children became their food during the destruction and heartbreak of the daughter of my people.

(Lamentations 4:11) 
The Lord has fully accomplished His fury; He has poured out the wrath of His indignation. He kindled a devastating fire in Zion, and it devoured even her very foundations.

(Lamentations 4:12) 
The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world could not believe that an enemy and an adversary would ever enter through the gates of Jerusalem, a city thought to be impregnable.

(Lamentations 4:13) 
This disaster came because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst.

(Lamentations 4:14) 
They, the defiled priests and prophets, wandered like blind men in the streets, so stained with blood that they became ritually impure. And when they could not avoid it, they defiled others even by touching them with their garments.

(Lamentations 4:15) 
'Depart, you who are defiled!' people cried out to them. 'Depart, depart, do not touch!' Indeed, they were consumed by wrath and wasted away. The nations said among themselves: 'They, the people of God, will no longer dwell among them here.'

(Lamentations 4:16) 
The very presence of the Lord has scattered them; He will no longer look upon them with favor. He showed no regard for the priests, nor did He pity the elders, no matter their former status.

(Lamentations 4:17) 
While we still had a little life left, our eyes failed, constantly looking for our vain help. We watched intently for a foreign nation that could not possibly save us.

(Lamentations 4:18) 
Our enemies hunted our steps so that we could not walk in our own streets. Our end drew near, our days were fulfilled, for our ultimate destruction had come.

(Lamentations 4:19) 
Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the sky. They pursued us relentlessly over the mountains, and they lay in wait for us in the barren desert.

(Lamentations 4:20) 
Our very breath of life, the Lord's Anointed King, was captured because of our sins. He, in whom we had placed our hope, to whom we had said: 'Under your shadow, we shall live safely among the nations.'

(Lamentations 4:21) 
Rejoice and be glad for now, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. But beware, to you also the cup of God's wrath shall pass; you shall be made drunk with judgment and stripped bare in humiliation.

(Lamentations 4:22) 
Your punishment is now complete, O daughter of Zion; the Lord will no longer cause you to go into exile. But He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, and He will fully uncover your sins.

(Lamentations 5:1) 
Remember, Lord, what has happened to us. Look upon us and truly see our deep disgrace.

(Lamentations 5:2) 
Our inheritance, the land God gave us, has been given to strangers. Our homes have been taken by foreigners.

(Lamentations 5:3) 
We have become like orphans, completely abandoned by our father. Our mothers are like widows, left alone and unprotected.

(Lamentations 5:4) 
We have to buy even our own water to drink. We must pay a high price for our own wood to burn.

(Lamentations 5:5) 
We are constantly under threat, with the enemy's yoke on our necks. Even when we are exhausted, there is no rest for us.

(Lamentations 5:6) 
We were forced to seek help and make alliances with Egypt and Assyria, just so we could get enough bread to eat.

(Lamentations 5:7) 
Our fathers sinned greatly, and now they are gone from this earth. But we, their children, are left to carry the heavy burden of their wickedness.

(Lamentations 5:8) 
We are ruled by mere servants, who have no right to govern us. There was no one who could rescue us from their cruel grasp.

(Lamentations 5:9) 
We had to go out into the desolate wilderness, risking our very lives to find bread, facing the constant threat of the enemy's sword.

(Lamentations 5:10) 
Our skin has become as dark and cracked as a baking oven, scorched by the ravaging heat of famine and disease.

(Lamentations 5:11) 
They violated the women in Jerusalem, the holy city. They violently dishonored the virgins in the towns throughout the land of Judah.

(Lamentations 5:12) 
Our respected leaders were brutally hanged, left to die by their hands. The faces of our elders were shown no reverence or mercy; they were not ashamed to dishonor them.

(Lamentations 5:13) 
They forced our young men to do the heavy labor of grinding grain. Even young boys collapsed under the burden of carrying heavy loads of wood.

(Lamentations 5:14) 
The wise elders no longer sit at the city gates to offer counsel. Our young men are gone from the joyful choirs of praise.

(Lamentations 5:15) 
The joy in our hearts has utterly vanished. Our festive dances have turned into bitter mourning.

(Lamentations 5:16) 
The crown of our glory has fallen from our heads—our honor and our rule are gone. Woe to us! All this has happened because we have sinned against God.

(Lamentations 5:17) 
Because of this profound loss, our hearts are filled with sorrow. Our eyes are now dimmed, darkened by endless tears and despair.

(Lamentations 5:18) 
All this suffering has come upon us because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate and burned. Wild foxes now roam freely where our holy Temple once stood.

(Lamentations 5:19) 
But You, O Lord, remain on Your throne forever. Your sovereign rule endures through every single generation.

(Lamentations 5:20) 
Why would You forget us forever, O Lord? Will You abandon us for the rest of our days, leaving us in this endless sorrow?

(Lamentations 5:21) 
Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will truly turn. Make our lives new again, restoring our days as they were in the beginning of our history.

(Lamentations 5:22) 
It cannot be that You have completely rejected us, can it? Or is Your anger against us simply too great to ever relent?

(Baruch 1:1) 
These are the words written in this book by Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Zedekiah, the son of Sedei, the son of Hilkiah, while he was in Babylon.

(Baruch 1:2) 
This happened in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, during the period when the Chaldeans had captured Jerusalem and burned the city with fire.

(Baruch 1:3) 
Baruch read the words of this book aloud for Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and for all the people who had come to listen to the book.

(Baruch 1:4) 
He read it for the nobles, the sons of kings, the elders, and for all the people—from the least important to the most important—everyone who was living in Babylon by the Sodi River.

(Baruch 1:5) 
When the people heard these words, they wept. They fasted and prayed in the presence of the Lord.

(Baruch 1:6) 
They also collected money, each person contributing what they could.

(Baruch 1:7) 
They sent this money to Jerusalem, to Jehoiakim the priest, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum. It was also sent to the other priests and to all the people who were with him in Jerusalem.

(Baruch 1:8) 
This happened after Baruch received the vessels from the Lord’s Temple, which had been carried away from it. He was to bring them back to the land of Judah. This occurred on the tenth day of the month of Sivan. These were the silver vessels that Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, had made for the Temple.

(Baruch 1:9) 
All this took place after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had captured Jeconiah, along with the princes, the other captives, the powerful men, and the common people of the land from Jerusalem, and had led them all away into Babylon.

(Baruch 1:10) 
And the people in Babylon sent this message: 'We have sent you money. Use it to buy burnt offerings, incense, and grain offerings, and make sacrifices for sin. Then, pray for us yourselves to the Lord our God.'

(Baruch 1:11) 
They said this because, 'we have sinned before the Lord our God. We did not trust in Him enough to listen to the voice of the Lord our God.'

(Baruch 1:12) 
We stubbornly resisted the commands that the Lord gave to us, right before our very eyes.

(Baruch 1:13) 
Because of this, we have been subjected to all these evils and scourges to this very day—everything that the Lord has brought upon us and upon all of Israel. This punishment came upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, and our fathers.

(Baruch 1:14) 
We have continued to sin before the Lord our God by not trusting Him, and by not listening attentively to His voice.

(Baruch 1:15) 
The consequences of these evils have become manifest for us and for our fathers, even to this very day.

(Baruch 1:16) 
The Lord brought upon us all these evils, exactly as He had warned us He would.

(Baruch 1:17) 
We did not seek the favor of the Lord our God, so that each of us might turn away from our very wicked ways.

(Baruch 1:18) 
The Lord was vigilant in bringing these evils upon us, because the Lord is just in all His works and in all that He commanded us.

(Baruch 1:19) 
We did not obey His voice by walking in the precepts of our Lord that He gave to us.

(Baruch 1:20) 
From the day the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt until this very day, we have been faithless to the Lord our God. We have been scattered because of our many iniquities and our persistent defiance, for we have sinned in the sight of the Lord our God.

(Baruch 1:21) 
The evils and curses that the Lord ordained through His servant Moses have clung to us. These were decreed on the day He brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, when He promised to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, and these curses have been fulfilled and persist even to this day.

(Baruch 1:22) 
We did not obey the voice of the Lord our God, despite all the words of the prophets whom He sent to us.

(Baruch 1:23) 
Instead, each one followed the wicked imagination of his own heart, offering sacrifices to foreign gods and doing evil in the sight of the Lord our God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:1) 
This is why the Lord heard our cries and laments that we made before Him, because we had sinned against Him.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:2) 
And He brought upon us the disaster that the Lord had commanded against us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:3) 
And the Lord drove us from our own land, sending us to the nations where He scattered us, and all our friends were made distant from us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:4) 
And we were made subject to others, living in misery and in all ignominy because of the curse that He had placed on us, just as He had done to our enemies.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:5) 
We did not obey the voice of the Lord our God to walk in His commandments, which He had given to us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:6) 
The time of evil fell upon us, when the Lord sent His judgment upon Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:7) 
He brought upon us what was written in the book of the Law of Moses and of the Covenant, that a man would eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of his own daughter.—This refers to the extreme famine and cannibalism during sieges, as predicted in Deuteronomy 28:53-57.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:8) 
And He gave them over to the subjection of all the kingdoms around us, to be a reproach and a desolation among every people where the Lord had scattered us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:9) 
And we became the lowest, not the highest, because we sinned against the Lord our God by not obeying His voice.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:10) 
And our Lord is just. But we and our fathers are put to shame today.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:11) 
All these words came upon us, which the Lord spoke to us, and to our judges who judged Israel, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to every man of Israel and Judah.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:12) 
So that He might bring great evils upon us, such as have not been done under the sky—meaning the whole created order—just as they were done in Jerusalem, according to those things written in the Law of Moses.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:13) 
So that a man would eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of his own daughter.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:14) 
And He gave them over to the subjection of all the kingdoms around us, to be a reproach and a desolation among every people where the Lord had scattered us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:15) 
And we became the lowest, not the highest, because we sinned against the Lord our God by not obeying His voice.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:16) 
And our Lord is just. But we and our fathers are put to shame today.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:17) 
Behold, we have been made in every land where You have scattered us into a reproach, a curse, and a state of sin, according to all the iniquities of our fathers who turned away from You, O Lord our God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:18) 
Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life; receive them with your ears, so that you may know true wisdom.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:19) 
What is it, O Israel, that you are in the land of your enemies? You have grown old in a foreign land; you have been defiled among the dead, esteemed among those who go down to the place of the dead?—Referring to the state of exile and spiritual death, not literally among corpses.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:20) 
You have abandoned the fountain of wisdom.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:21) 
For if you had walked in the way of God, you would surely have lived in peace in the land.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:22) 
Learn where wisdom is, where strength is, where understanding is, so that you may also know where length of days is, and life, where the light of the eyes is, and peace.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:23) 
Who has found her place? And who has entered her treasures?

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:24) 
Or who has ascended into the universe and taken her, or brought her down from the clouds?—Using 'universe' here for *caelum* to denote the vastness of creation, implying wisdom is not found by physical exploration of space.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:25) 
Or who has crossed the sea and found her, or brought her forth as treasures?

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:26) 
No one knows her ways, nor anyone who grasps her.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:27) 
But He who knows all things knows her, and has found her by His own understanding.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:28) 
He who prepared the earth in eternal time, and filled it with four-footed beasts and flying creatures.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:29) 
He who fills the sea and appointed it for its boundaries.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:30) 
He who also called the stars by their names.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:31) 
He who also sends forth lightnings, and they appear; and their voices (thunder) are heard in their appointed office (purpose).

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:32) 
He who opened the treasures and brought them forth like birds.—Referring to divine actions like bringing forth rain, wind, or other elements from hidden 'treasures' of creation.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:33) 
He gave the way of understanding, and showed it to His servant Jacob and to His beloved Israel.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:34) 
After these things, He (Wisdom, personified as God's Word) was seen on the earth and lived among men.—This foreshadows the Incarnation of Christ, as Wisdom is often personified as the Word of God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:35) 
This is the book of the commandments of God, and the Law, which endures forever.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:36) 
All who hold fast to it lead to life; all who abandon it lead to death.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:37) 
Turn back, O Jacob, and grasp her (Wisdom); walk in her way, shining brightly in her sight, in clarity against her light.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:38) 
Do not give your glory to another, nor your dignity to a foreign nation.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:39) 
Behold, we are blessed, O Israel, because what is pleasing to God is known to us.

(Baruch 3:1) 
And now, Lord Almighty, God of Israel, my soul is in deep distress, and my anxious spirit cries out to You.

(Baruch 3:2) 
Hear us, Lord, and have mercy, because we have sinned before You.

(Baruch 3:3) 
For You abide eternally, but we perish because of our sins in this earthly age.

(Baruch 3:4) 
Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the Israelites who are like the dead, and the prayer of their children, who have sinned against You and did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. Because of this disobedience, all these evils have clung to us.

(Baruch 3:5) 
Do not remember the iniquities of our fathers, but remember Your powerful hand and Your holy name in this time of our need.

(Baruch 3:6) 
Because You are our Lord God, and we will praise You, O Lord.

(Baruch 3:7) 
For this reason, You have placed Your reverence within our hearts, so that we may call upon Your holy name and praise You in our captivity. We have turned away from the iniquity of our fathers, who sinned against You.

(Baruch 3:8) 
And behold, here we are today in our captivity, where You have dispersed us as an object of reproach, a curse, and suffering the consequences of sin, according to all the iniquities of our fathers who turned away from You, O Lord our God.

(Baruch 3:9) 
Hear, O Israel, the commands that lead to life; listen attentively so that you may know true wisdom.

(Baruch 3:10) 
Why is it, O Israel, that you find yourself in the land of your enemies?

(Baruch 3:11) 
You have grown old in a foreign land. You have become defiled among those who are spiritually dead.

(Baruch 3:12) 
You have been counted among those who are descending into spiritual ruin and the underworld.

(Baruch 3:13) 
You abandoned the fountain of true wisdom.

(Baruch 3:14) 
For if you had walked in the way of God, you would surely have lived in peace throughout all ages.

(Baruch 3:15) 
Learn where true wisdom is found, where virtue resides, and where understanding exists, so that you may also know where length of days and life are, and where the light for your eyes and peace are.

(Baruch 3:16) 
Who has ever found the place where wisdom dwells? And who has entered into her hidden treasures?

(Baruch 3:17) 
Where are the rulers of the nations, and those who dominated the beasts that are upon the earth, and those who delighted in controlling the birds of the sky?

(Baruch 3:18) 
Where are those who hoard silver and gold, in which people place their trust, and whose endless acquisitions have no limit? Where are those who work with silver, constantly anxious, yet their works bring no true discovery or fulfillment?

(Baruch 3:19) 
They have been destroyed and descended into the underworld, and others have risen in their place.

(Baruch 3:20) 
Young people saw the light of the world and lived upon the earth, but they did not know the way of true instruction and wisdom.

(Baruch 3:21) 
Nor did they understand its paths; nor did their children embrace it. The way of wisdom became distant from them.

(Baruch 3:22) 
Wisdom was not heard of in the land of Canaan, nor was it seen in Teman.

(Baruch 3:23) 
Even the descendants of Hagar, who seek worldly wisdom from the earth, the merchants of the land and Teman, and the storytellers, and the seekers of worldly prudence and understanding—they did not know the way of God, nor were they mindful of His paths.

(Baruch 3:24) 
O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how immense is the place of His possession!

(Baruch 3:25) 
It is great, and has no end; it is lofty and immeasurable.

(Baruch 3:26) 
There were the famous giants, those who existed from the beginning, great in stature and skilled in warfare.

(Baruch 3:27) 
The Lord did not choose these giants, nor did He give them the way of true instruction.

(Baruch 3:28) 
And for that reason, they perished. Because they did not possess wisdom, they were destroyed because of their own folly.

(Baruch 3:29) 
Who has ascended into the sky to obtain wisdom, and brought it down from the clouds?

(Baruch 3:30) 
Who has crossed the great sea and found wisdom, then brought it back, even for the most precious gold?

(Baruch 3:31) 
There is no one among humanity who knows wisdom's way, nor anyone who can grasp her paths.

(Baruch 3:32) 
But He who knows all things, He alone knows wisdom. He found it through His own prudence—He who prepared the earth to endure eternally and filled it with livestock and every kind of four-footed creature.

(Baruch 3:33) 
He who sends forth light, and it travels forth; He called it, and it obeyed Him with awe and trembling.

(Baruch 3:34) 
The stars give their light in their appointed stations, and they rejoice.

(Baruch 3:35) 
They were called, and they answered, "Here we are!" And they shone with joy for Him who made them.

(Baruch 3:36) 
This is our God, and no other will be esteemed as equal to Him.

(Baruch 3:37) 
He is the one who discovered every way of true instruction and wisdom, and He handed it over to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved.

(Baruch 3:38) 
After these things, Wisdom Himself, God the Son, was seen on the earth, and He lived among mankind.

(Baruch 4:1) 
This is the law of God, the word of His mouth, His statutes, and His judgments. Everyone who keeps these divine commands will find eternal life; but those who abandon them will find only death.

(Baruch 4:2) 
Return, O Jacob, and take hold of this Law. Walk in the way of its splendor, in the presence of its guiding light.

(Baruch 4:3) 
Do not surrender your glory to another nation, nor your honor to a foreign people.

(Baruch 4:4) 
We are truly blessed, O Israel, because the things that please God are known to us, His chosen people.

(Baruch 4:5) 
Take courage, My people, O Israel, remember the covenant God made with you.

(Baruch 4:6) 
You were handed over to foreign nations, not for your total destruction, but because of God's righteous anger at your sins. Your enemies then heaped insults upon you.

(Baruch 4:7) 
For you provoked Him who created you—God, the Eternal One—when you sacrificed to demons and not to God.

(Baruch 4:8) 
For you forgot God, who nourished you and sustained your life. And in doing so, you grieved Jerusalem, the Holy City that sustained its own people.

(Baruch 4:9) 
For Jerusalem, personified as a mother, saw the wrath of God coming upon you, her children. And she cried out: 'Listen, you neighboring cities of Zion, for God has brought great sorrow upon me!'

(Baruch 4:10) 
For I have seen the captivity of my people—my sons and my daughters—which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:11) 
Indeed, I raised them with joy and gladness; but now I have sent them away in weeping and mourning.

(Baruch 4:12) 
Let no one rejoice over me, for I am a widow and utterly desolate. I sit in desolation because of the sins of my children, for they turned away from the Law of God.

(Baruch 4:13) 
They neither knew His judgments, nor did they walk in His precepts. They abandoned the very path of God's commandments.

(Baruch 4:14) 
Come, you neighboring cities of Zion, and truly witness this: for God has brought great sorrow upon me.

(Baruch 4:15) 
For I have seen the captivity of my people—my sons and my daughters—which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:16) 
They departed, weeping, as they marched along the road. For they were led away by their enemies, barefoot and in utter disgrace.

(Baruch 4:17) 
Take courage, O Jerusalem, for a great joy from God is coming to you.

(Baruch 4:18) 
For the very One who brought these terrible troubles upon you will also take away all your bitterness and sorrow at the proper time.

(Baruch 4:19) 
The Eternal God will send you spiritual healing and true righteousness, brought forth by His mighty power.

(Baruch 4:20) 
Pay close attention, you neighboring cities of Zion, and remember the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:21) 
For just as your enemy destroyed your children, so too will this same enemy swiftly witness its own destruction, and you, Jerusalem, will rejoice over its downfall.

(Baruch 4:22) 
For just as your enemies grieved over your forced separation from your land and people, so also will you rejoice over their complete destruction.

(Baruch 4:23) 
For God Himself will lead you back on a smooth and easy path, illuminated by the joy of His own Divine Light, and He will do so with His boundless mercy and perfect justice.

(Baruch 4:24) 
For just as you once eagerly strayed from God, now you must hasten to gather yourselves together and seek Him out, doing so with ten times the diligence you once showed in abandoning Him.

(Baruch 4:25) 
For the very One who permitted these evils to come upon you—He Himself will again bring you eternal joy along with your full salvation.

(Baruch 4:26) 
Take courage, O Jerusalem, for the One who gave you your name, and who knows you intimately, will indeed comfort you.

(Baruch 4:27) 
Woe to those miserable ones who plundered you, O Jerusalem, and who rejoiced over your ruin.

(Baruch 4:28) 
Woe to those wretched cities where your people were forced to serve as slaves! And woe to that city, Babylon, which took your children as captives.

(Baruch 4:29) 
For just as that city rejoiced over your ruin and exulted in your downfall, so too will she be utterly grieved in her own desolation.

(Baruch 4:30) 
And I will take away the joy of her many inhabitants, and her exultation will be transformed into deep mourning.

(Baruch 4:31) 
For a divine fire of judgment will come upon her from the Eternal God, and she will become a dwelling place for demons for all time to come.

(Baruch 4:32) 
Look around, O Jerusalem, turn your gaze toward the East, and behold the great joy that is coming to you from God.

(Baruch 4:33) 
For behold, your children are returning! Those whom you sent away dispersed are now coming, gathered from the rising of the sun to its setting—all at the command of the Holy One, rejoicing in the honor and glory of God.

(Baruch 4:34) 
Cast off, O Jerusalem, the garments of your mourning and your deep affliction! Instead, clothe yourself in the everlasting beauty and honor that God bestows upon you.

(Baruch 4:35) 
Envelop yourself with the double robe of righteousness, which comes directly from God. And place a glorious diadem upon your head, in honor of the Eternal God.

(Baruch 4:36) 
For God will indeed rejoice in your renewed beauty and splendor, and this joy will last for all eternity.

(Baruch 4:37) 
For God Himself will complete your deliverance with great joy, a deliverance coming directly from Him, your Divine Liberator.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:1) 
Strip yourself, Jerusalem (representing God's people), of your garments of sorrow and the state of your affliction. Instead, clothe yourself in the everlasting beauty and glory of God's grace, which He has given to you.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:2) 
Clothe yourself with a double garment of His divine justice, which comes from God. And place a crown upon your head to honor the Almighty God, the Powerful One.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:3) 
For God will manifest His radiant glory through you to everyone on the face of the earth, throughout the entire world.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:4) 
For by your own name, Jerusalem, God will name you forever: 'Peace of Justice' and 'the Glory of Holiness'.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:5) 
Rise up, Jerusalem, and stand on the highest point, filled with God's glory. Look all around you to the east, and see all your children gathered. They are coming from every direction, from the sunrise in the east to the sunset in the west. They have been gathered by the Word of the Holy One, and they rejoice in the memory of God's faithfulness.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:6) 
Your children were taken from you on foot, suffering humiliation as your enemies led them away. But the Lord God will bring them back to you. They will be carried with great honor, like rightful children of the Divine Kingdom.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:7) 
For God will lower every high mountain. And He will fill every valley and level all the rough and uneven ground. He does this so that the people of Israel may walk with dignity and honor, illuminated by the glory of God.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:8) 
Moreover, the forests and every pleasant tree will provide shade for Israel, making their journey comfortable, all by the express command of God.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:9) 
For God will lead the people of Israel back with great rejoicing, illuminated by the glorious light of His divine majesty. He will do this with the infinite mercy and perfect justice that originate from Him alone.

(Baruch 6:1) 
Because of the sins you committed against God, you will be taken as captives into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Babylonians.

(Baruch 6:2) 
Therefore, once you have entered Babylon, you will remain there for many years, for a long time—for as many as seven generations. After this period, I will lead you out of that place and give you peace.

(Baruch 6:3) 
But now, in Babylon, you will see their gods made of gold, silver, wood, and stone. These idols are portable, carried by people, and they are themselves objects of fear, or cause fear in their worshippers.

(Baruch 6:4) 
See to it, then, that you do not become like these foreign peoples. Do not be terrified by their fear and fall into their idol worship.

(Baruch 6:5) 
Instead, when you see crowds of people around you and behind you, worshipping these idols, you must say in your hearts: 'You alone are to be adored, Lord.'

(Baruch 6:6) 
For My angel is with you, and I will indeed demand an accounting for your souls.

(Baruch 6:7) 
These idols have their tongues polished and fashioned with great care from wood, and even from gold and silver, yet they are dressed with these. But the people who make them do not realize these idols are mere clay, and they cannot speak.

(Baruch 6:8) 
They have ears, just like a human, but they cannot hear. They have eyes, just like a human, but they cannot see.

(Baruch 6:9) 
They also have hands to feel, but they cannot touch. They have feet, but they cannot walk, because they are truly unable to move. Just like those who carry them, these idols are brought to shame.

(Baruch 6:10) 
For this reason, if they are thrown to the ground, they cannot rise by themselves. And if someone sets them upright, they cannot stand on their own. They are like dead things, such are the images placed upon them.

(Baruch 6:11) 
Furthermore, their priests steal the gold, silver, and garments that adorn the idols from under their temple roofs. They use these items for themselves and for prostitutes.

(Baruch 6:12) 
They dress the idols in gold and silver garments, adorning them as if they were people. Yet they do not allow these garments to remain with the idols permanently.

(Baruch 6:13) 
Indeed, the garments are better than the idols themselves, for the garments can suffer no harm in the way a living thing might. The priests actually use these very garments for their own needs.

(Baruch 6:14) 
Idols are implicated in theft, robbery, and among prostitutes. Indeed, the temple prostitutes gather women around them, sitting by the roadside, and burning incense themselves.

(Baruch 6:15) 
But if anyone among the worshippers is brought into the presence of someone who performs such deeds of idolatry, that person will argue directly that these idols belong to their gods.

(Baruch 6:16) 
For even their priests in their temples have their knees and heads shaved from behind, and they are stripped bare.

(Baruch 6:17) 
They shout loudly, like people at a feast, demonstrating their connection to these temples.

(Baruch 6:18) 
The moon, the sun, and the stars do not believe in these idols, though they themselves are shining and useful. But the idols are vain, useless, and without a voice.

(Baruch 6:19) 
They are made of wood, and from that same wood, for ornamentation, they are overlaid with brass, bronze, iron, lead, and clay.

(Baruch 6:20) 
Yet they cannot be saved from moths and rust.

(Baruch 6:21) 
They are covered with purple and blue garments, as if to be cleansed. Because they are not gods, they will be mocked.

(Baruch 6:22) 
Therefore, in every way, the righteous person who has no idols is better, for he will be without reproach.

(Baruch 6:23) 
Indeed, they are skillfully crafted from wood, and they are clothed with silver, gold, purple, blue, and fine linen.

(Baruch 6:24) 
Yet they will not be free from rust, moths, and decay. The materials they are made from are better than the idols themselves. But the idols cannot save themselves.

(Baruch 6:25) 
And the man who makes them, if he becomes ill, is as helpless as a dead man.

(Baruch 6:26) 
For just as in a house, so also in their temples there is theft, falsehood, ropes, and snares. This is why it is better to be righteous and to have no idols, for such people will be free from reproach.

(Baruch 6:27) 
And some among them have perished because of their own deeds. How then can anyone consider or think that these are gods?

(Baruch 6:28) 
Indeed, the Chaldeans themselves honor these idols. When they see a mute person who cannot speak, they offer him to Bel, asking that he might speak, as if the idol could actually perceive or understand.

(Baruch 6:29) 
Yet these idols cannot see. And those who worship them, despite despising them, still leave them. Even when they know these things, they cannot abandon the idols because they themselves lack understanding.

(Baruch 6:30) 
Women, adorned with ropes, sit in the roads, burning straw incense. If one of them is approached by a passerby and lies with him, the others will mock her for not being considered worthy like themselves, and for her rope not being broken.

(Baruch 6:31) 
Everything that is done concerning these idols is false. How then can anyone estimate or think that they are gods?

(Baruch 6:32) 
They are made by carpenters and goldsmiths. They cannot come into existence except by the skill of these craftsmen.

(Baruch 6:33) 
And the idols themselves have no means to repair themselves as they age.

(Baruch 6:34) 
For they are carried around, and what can they do by themselves?

(Baruch 6:35) 
But if someone cannot walk with steady feet, he must be carried by another, since he cannot move on his own. The idols are no more straight or self-moving than carved wood.

(Baruch 6:36) 
And these idols, adorned with gold, silver, stone, and cloaks, are like little children who have no strength. They cannot save themselves from robbers.

(Baruch 6:37) 
From a wall, or wood, or stones, robbers can take the gold, silver, and garments that are upon these idols, and then they leave with their plunder.

(Baruch 6:38) 
Thus, it is better to give to the poor, from whom nothing is stolen, than to these idols. They possess no power to benefit themselves or others.

(Baruch 6:39) 
Clothed with wood, cloth, and lime, they cannot save themselves from moths, rust, or dust.

(Baruch 6:40) 
Furthermore, when there is smoke in their temple, it settles on their faces, darkening them.

(Baruch 6:41) 
Their eyes are like those of humans; they are made of bronze, yet they do not look upon anything.

(Baruch 6:42) 
Their priests steal from their own gods and lock them up at night. They do not light lamps for them, lest they reveal the thefts that occur in the temple. They even stretch ropes over the idols to secure them.

(Baruch 6:43) 
But when they do light them, they forcefully make these gods shine with light, yet the idols do not see. How then can anyone consider or think that they are gods?

(Baruch 6:44) 
Indeed, when they have received anything from someone, the priests themselves, even in their own homes, steal the gold, silver, and garments from the idols. They then use these items to dress their wives and children.

(Baruch 6:45) 
Or if some evil befalls them from anyone, it is better for them to deal with a powerful king or a tyrant than with these idols.

(Baruch 6:46) 
By this, it is certainly clear that they are not gods, for they cannot save a person from death, nor are they strong enough to protect from insults.

(Baruch 6:47) 
They do not restore sight to the blind, nor do they free anyone from prison, nor do they raise the dead.

(Baruch 6:48) 
They do not relieve the afflicted, nor do they cause kings to act with kindness. They do not grant sons or daughters.

(Baruch 6:49) 
Men, women, and children sacrifice to them. How then can anyone consider or think that these are gods?

(Baruch 6:50) 
They do not deliver anyone from war, nor from misfortunes. They do not deliver from Egypt, nor from the Greeks.

(Baruch 6:51) 
But even when they are sealed with wood, gold, and silver, and clothed with cloaks, it is clear that they are not gods.

(Baruch 6:52) 
And they show every nation and king that they are not gods, but merely works of human hands, and they have no power within themselves.

(Baruch 6:53) 
Who then can make it clear that they are not gods, and that they are not beyond reproach?

(Baruch 6:54) 
They do not appoint a king, nor do they become like true gods. Who then will stand up for them? Or when one judges them, they are found to be not good.

(Baruch 6:55) 
They cannot save themselves from water, from rain, or from sweat. They do not save themselves from the damage to the wood and the lime that forms them. Even their silver and gold faces, when they exist, are subject to rust and decay.

(Baruch 6:56) 
Worshippers light many lamps for them, as if the idols were incapable of seeing on their own.

(Baruch 6:57) 
They are adorned with wood, gold, silver, and stones. The things they do with water, and in their temples, are meaningless.

(Baruch 6:58) 
Better is the righteous person who has no idols, because he has cast these things far away.

(Baruch 6:59) 
Indeed, they cannot preserve themselves from the wind, the air, or the storm. They will not save from the tempest, nor from the wind.

(Baruch 6:60) 
They cannot protect from fire, whether in summer or winter, nor from a storm.

(Baruch 6:61) 
Through this, it is evident that they are not gods, because they cannot save themselves, nor deliver themselves from fire, nor from bronze (their material), nor from a storm.

(Baruch 6:62) 
And they are clothed with wood, and gold, and silver, and cloth, just like wooden items in houses. They are themselves works of human hands, and they have no power within themselves.

(Baruch 6:63) 
Because by this it is manifest that they are not gods. For they do not preserve themselves from moths, nor from rust, nor from dust.

(Baruch 6:64) 
And concerning winds, and rains, and waters, and human actions: those who cannot be saved from the very things by which wood, and stones, and gold, and silver are made—these are not gods.

(Baruch 6:65) 
It will therefore be manifest in all things: that in all respects, they are not gods.

(Baruch 6:66) 
Therefore, do not fear them.

(Baruch 6:67) 
For just as a broken pot is useless, so too are their idols that are in houses, they are dishonorable.

(Baruch 6:68) 
They have eyes, and ears, and heads, and feet,

(Baruch 6:69) 
But those who use them are the ones who truly see or hear. The idols themselves have no such faculties.

(Ezekiel 1:1) 
It happened in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month—reckoned from a significant historical event—while I was among the captives by the Chebar River, that the spiritual heavens were opened, and I began to see visions from God.

(Ezekiel 1:2) 
This same fifth day of the month also marked the fifth year of the exile of King Joachim.

(Ezekiel 1:3) 
The word of the Lord came directly to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, who was a priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the Chebar River. And at that moment, the powerful hand of the Lord came upon him, empowering him for this vision.

(Ezekiel 1:4) 
And as I looked, I saw a great whirlwind coming from the north. There was a massive cloud, with fire swirling within it, and brilliant light shone all around it. From the very center of this fire, there was something that gleamed like polished, glowing metal, shining from the heart of the flames.

(Ezekiel 1:5) 
And from the center of this shining fire, I saw the likeness of four living creatures emerge. This was their overall appearance: they had the form and likeness of human beings.

(Ezekiel 1:6) 
Each one of these creatures had four faces, and each one also had four wings.

(Ezekiel 1:7) 
Their legs were straight, terminating in feet whose soles were like the hoofs of a calf, perfectly rounded and gleaming. Their feet sparkled and shone like the appearance of burnished, glowing bronze.

(Ezekiel 1:8) 
Underneath their wings, on each of their four sides, there were human hands visible. Their faces and wings were arranged around their four sides.

(Ezekiel 1:9) 
Their wings were joined one to another, connecting them. As they moved, they did not turn around; instead, each creature advanced straight forward, in the direction of its primary face.

(Ezekiel 1:10) 
This was the likeness of their faces: Each of the four creatures had a human face in the front. On their right side, each had a lion's face. On their left side, each had an ox's face. And on the back (or above), each had an eagle's face.

(Ezekiel 1:11) 
Their faces were arranged in this manner, and their wings were spread out above them. Each creature had two wings joined together, and two other wings covered their bodies.

(Ezekiel 1:12) 
Each one moved straight forward, in the direction of its primary face. Wherever the impulse or leading of the Spirit was, that is where they went. They never turned back as they moved, maintaining a consistent direction.

(Ezekiel 1:13) 
The living creatures themselves had an appearance like burning coals of fire, blazing brightly. There was also the appearance of lamps, moving quickly among the creatures, casting light. There was the intense brightness of fire, and from this fire, flashes of lightning constantly came forth.

(Ezekiel 1:14) 
The living creatures themselves moved back and forth with incredible speed, appearing like sudden flashes of lightning.

(Ezekiel 1:15) 
As I continued to look at the living creatures, I saw a single wheel resting on the ground beside each of the creatures. This wheel also appeared to have four sides, or aspects, corresponding to the creature's orientation.

(Ezekiel 1:16) 
The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the shining, deep-blue color of the sea, or a sea-green gem. All four wheels had the same exact likeness. Their appearance and structure seemed to be like a wheel integrated within another wheel.

(Ezekiel 1:17) 
When the creatures and wheels moved, they could go in any of their four directions without turning. They did not have to pivot or reverse course as they advanced.

(Ezekiel 1:18) 
The rims of the wheels were exceedingly high, majestic, and awe-inspiring to behold. And these rims were completely full of eyes all around the circumference of all four wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:19) 
When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved alongside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were also lifted up with them, always in perfect unison.

(Ezekiel 1:20) 
Wherever the living spirit of the creatures desired to go, there the wheels and the creatures moved. And the wheels were lifted up alongside the spirit, because the same Spirit that animated the living creatures was also present and active within the wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:21) 
When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when they stood still, the wheels also stood still. And when the creatures were lifted from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, because the same animating Spirit of life was in the wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:22) 
Above the heads of the living creatures, there was an appearance of an expanse, or a firmament. It looked like dazzling, awe-inspiring crystal, spread out high above their heads.

(Ezekiel 1:23) 
Underneath this crystal-like expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one wing towards another. Each creature had two wings covering its body in humility and reverence, while the other two were extended outward.

(Ezekiel 1:24) 
I heard the sound of their wings as they moved, like the roar of mighty rushing waters. It was like the voice of Almighty God Himself speaking from on high. When they walked, the sound was like the clamor of a vast army. And when they stood still, their wings were lowered, becoming silent.

(Ezekiel 1:25) 
And a voice came from above the crystal-like expanse that was over their heads when they stopped moving and lowered their wings.

(Ezekiel 1:26) 
Above the expanse that was over their heads, there was something like a throne, appearing like a sapphire stone in its brilliant blue. And seated upon this throne, there was a figure that appeared in the likeness of a man.

(Ezekiel 1:27) 
I saw what appeared to be polished, glowing metal, with the appearance of fire all around within it. From what appeared to be his waist upwards, and from his waist downwards, I saw what looked like sparkling, vibrant fire, and a brilliant light surrounded him.

(Ezekiel 1:28) 
The brilliant light surrounding Him was like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This entire vision was the visionary appearance of the glory of the Lord Himself, a visible manifestation of His divine majesty. When I saw all this, I immediately fell on my face in reverence and awe, and then I heard a voice speaking to me.

(Ezekiel 2:1) 
And He said to me, "Son of man" (meaning, 'you, a human being'), "stand up. I will speak with you directly."

(Ezekiel 2:2) 
And the Spirit entered into me right after He had finished speaking, and the Spirit made me stand on my feet, allowing me to fully receive the message. And I heard Him speaking to me directly.

(Ezekiel 2:3) 
And He then said, "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel—to the rebellious generations of people who have turned away from me. Both they and their ancestors have rebelled against me, right up to this very day."

(Ezekiel 2:4) 
The people are stubborn-faced and hard-hearted. To these people I am sending you. You shall say to them: 'This is what the Lord God says.'

(Ezekiel 2:5) 
And whether they listen or choose to ignore you (because they are a rebellious nation), they will know that a prophet from God has been among them.

(Ezekiel 2:6) 
Therefore, son of man, do not fear them, and do not be afraid of what they say. For you are living among faithless and corrupt people—you are dwelling among what seem like scorpions to you. Do not fear their words, and do not be terrified by their faces, because they are a rebellious nation.

(Ezekiel 2:7) 
And you shall speak my words to them, whether they listen or choose to ignore you, because they are rebellious.

(Ezekiel 2:8) 
Therefore, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious nation. Open your mouth and eat whatever I give to you, meaning, 'fully internalize and accept my message'.

(Ezekiel 2:9) 
And I saw a hand reaching out to me, holding a scroll, like a book. The hand unrolled the scroll before me, and it was written on both the inside and the outside, indicating the complete fullness of its message. Written on it were messages of grief, a mournful song of judgment, and declarations of inevitable sorrow.

(Ezekiel 3:3:1) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, whatever you find, eat it. Eat this scroll, and then go and speak to the children of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:2) 
So I opened my mouth, and He fed me that scroll.

(Ezekiel 3:3:3) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, your stomach will digest this, and your innermost being will be filled with this scroll that I am giving you.” So I ate it, and in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey.

(Ezekiel 3:3:4) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, go now to the entire nation of Israel, and you will speak My words to them.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:5) 
For you are not being sent to a people whose language is too deep or unknown for you to understand, but to the nation of Israel.

(Ezekiel 3:3:6) 
Nor are you sent to many peoples with deep speech and unknown languages, whose words you could not comprehend. Indeed, if you were sent to them, they would actually listen to you.

(Ezekiel 3:3:7) 
However, the nation of Israel will not want to listen to you, because they do not want to listen to Me. For all the people of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted, with untamed spirits.

(Ezekiel 3:3:8) 
Behold, I have made your face very strong against their faces, and your forehead very hard against their foreheads.

(Ezekiel 3:3:9) 
I have made your face like a diamond and like flint. Do not fear them, nor be afraid of their expressions, for they are a rebellious and provoking nation.

(Ezekiel 3:3:10) 
And He added and said to me: “Son of man, take all My words that I have spoken to you into your heart, and hear them with your ears.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:11) 
“And go, proceed to the exiles, to the children of your people. Speak to them, and tell them: ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ Perhaps they will listen, and then they will find peace and cease their rebellion.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:12) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rumbling: “Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place!”

(Ezekiel 3:3:13) 
This was the sound of the wings of the living creatures striking against one another, and the sound of the wheels following them, and a voice of great commotion.

(Ezekiel 3:3:14) 
The Spirit also lifted me up and took me away, and I went, bitter and indignant in my spirit. For the hand of the Lord was strengthening me, even through my emotions.

(Ezekiel 3:3:15) 
And I came to the exiles in Tel-abib (the settlement by the 'mound of fresh produce'), to those who lived by the Chebar River. I sat there for seven days, mourning in their midst.

(Ezekiel 3:3:16) 
And when seven days had passed, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 3:3:17) 
“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the nation of Israel. You will hear a word from My mouth, and you will declare it to them on My behalf.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:18) 
“If I say to a wicked person: ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him, nor speak to turn that wicked person from his wicked way so that he may live, that very wicked person will die in his iniquity. But I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:19) 
“But if you do warn the wicked person, and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, he indeed will die in his iniquity. But you will have delivered your own soul.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:20) 
“But also if a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place a stumbling block before him: this one will die in his sin. His righteous deeds which he had done will not be remembered. And even if you *should* warn him, he will die in his own sin, and I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:21) 
“But if you do warn a righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, and you will have delivered your own soul.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:22) 
And the hand of the Lord came upon me there, and He said to me: “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I will speak with you.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:23) 
So I arose and went out into the plain. And behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, just like the glory I had seen by the Chebar River. And I fell on my face in reverence.

(Ezekiel 3:3:24) 
Then the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet. And He spoke to me and said: “Go in, and shut your door within your house.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:25) 
“And as for you, Son of man, behold, they (the people of Israel) have figuratively bound you with cords, and they will keep you bound by them. You will not be able to go out among them to speak freely.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:26) 
“And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so you will be silent. You will not be a man constantly reproving, because they are a rebellious and provoking nation.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:27) 
“But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Let him who hears, hear. And let him who refuses to listen, remain unyielding,’ for they are a rebellious and provoking nation.”

(Ezekiel 4:1) 
You, son of man, take a clay brick, place it before you, and engrave a drawing of the city of Jerusalem on it.

(Ezekiel 4:2) 
Then, depict a siege around it: build siege works, construct a siege ramp, set up enemy camps, and position battering rams all around it.

(Ezekiel 4:3) 
Now, take an iron griddle and place it between yourself and the city, as if it were an iron wall. Set your face resolutely against the city, indicating the severity of the siege. This action shows a siege being laid against it, and this entire representation is a symbolic sign for the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 4:4) 
Then, you must lie on your left side and bear the sins of the house of Israel upon yourself. You will carry their sin for as many days as you lie in this position.

(Ezekiel 4:5) 
For I have appointed to you a period of 390 days, each day representing a year of their rebellion. During this time, you will symbolically bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 4:6) 
When those days are completed, you are to lie on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah for 40 days. Again, I have appointed each day to represent a year of their sin.

(Ezekiel 4:7) 
During this time, you will keep your face fixed on the representation of the siege of Jerusalem. Your arm will be bared, ready for action, as you prophesy against the city.

(Ezekiel 4:8) 
Listen, I have bound you with cords so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the full number of days for your symbolic siege.

(Ezekiel 4:9) 
Now, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Mix all these grains into a single vessel and use them to bake bread for yourself. You will eat this bread for the 390 days you are lying on your side, fulfilling your symbolic act.

(Ezekiel 4:10) 
The food you eat will be strictly rationed: twenty shekels by weight each day. You must eat this small amount at specific intervals throughout the day, ensuring it lasts.

(Ezekiel 4:11) 
And you will drink water by measure as well: a sixth of a hin each day. You will drink this small amount at specific intervals, just like your food.

(Ezekiel 4:12) 
You will eat this bread, coarse and unappetizing like barley cakes, and in their presence, you must bake it using human waste as fuel. This will be a shocking sign of extreme defilement.

(Ezekiel 4:13) 
The Lord declared: 'In this very manner, the children of Israel will eat their bread, defiled and unclean, among the pagan nations to which I will drive them into exile.'

(Ezekiel 4:14) 
Then I cried out, 'Oh no, Lord God! My soul has never been defiled by such things. I have never eaten anything that died a natural death or was torn by wild animals, nor has any unclean meat entered my mouth since my childhood!'

(Ezekiel 4:15) 
And He said to me, 'Very well, I grant your request. Look, I will allow you to use cow dung instead of human waste. You may now prepare your bread using that as fuel.'

(Ezekiel 4:16) 
Then He said to me, 'Son of man, listen! I am about to cut off Jerusalem's food supply, effectively breaking its staff of bread. They will eat their bread in carefully weighed portions, consumed with great anxiety, and drink their water by exact measure, filled with distress.'

(Ezekiel 4:17) 
This severe rationing is so that their supply of bread and water will utterly fail. They will mourn and lament to one another in their suffering, and they will waste away because of their sins.

(Ezekiel 5:1) 
And you, son of man, take a sharp razor—one for shaving hair and beard. Then take weighing scales and divide the hairs you have shaved off.

(Ezekiel 5:2) 
You shall burn a third of these hairs in the middle of the city—Jerusalem—in the time of the siege. Then, take another third and strike it with a sword all around the city. And the last third you shall scatter to the wind, but I will draw a sword and pursue those who scatter.

(Ezekiel 5:3) 
Yet, from these scattered hairs, take a very small number, and bind them into the folds of your cloak.

(Ezekiel 5:4) 
But even from these few hairs you just bound, you must again take some, throw them into the fire, and burn them with fire. From that burning, fire will spread to consume the whole house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 5:5) 
Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem. I placed her in the center of the nations, with many lands surrounding her.

(Ezekiel 5:6) 
But she has despised My laws in her wickedness even more than the nations did. She did not keep My commandments, nor did she even follow the laws of the nations surrounding her, much less My own commandments. This is because she utterly rejected My laws.

(Ezekiel 5:7) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have acted with more wickedness than the nations around you, and have not walked in My commandments, nor have you kept My laws, nor have you even lived according to the laws of the nations around you—

(Ezekiel 5:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am coming against you, and I will execute My judgments in your midst, for all the nations to see.

(Ezekiel 5:9) 
And I will do to you what I have never done before, and what I will never do again, because of all your abominable practices.

(Ezekiel 5:10) 
Therefore, fathers will eat their children in your midst, and children will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter all your remaining survivors to every wind.

(Ezekiel 5:11) 
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, because you have defiled My holy temple with all your idols and with all your detestable practices, I also will cut you off. My eye will not show pity, and I will have no mercy on you.

(Ezekiel 5:12) 
A third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine in your midst. Another third will fall by the sword around you. And the last third I will scatter to every wind, and I will draw a sword and pursue them.

(Ezekiel 5:13) 
Thus, I will complete My furious judgment and make My indignation rest fully upon them. And I will be satisfied; then they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in My righteous zeal, when I have accomplished My indignation against them.

(Ezekiel 5:14) 
I will turn you into a desolate place and make you an object of disgrace among the nations surrounding you, in the full view of everyone who passes by.

(Ezekiel 5:15) 
So you will become a disgrace, a cause for scorn, a warning, and an object of horror to the nations around you, when I execute My judgments against you with fury, and with indignation, and with furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 5:16) 
Because I will send upon you the deadly arrows of famine, which will be for your destruction—indeed, I will send them upon you to utterly destroy you. I will intensify the famine among you, and I will break your very supply of bread.

(Ezekiel 5:17) 
And I will send upon you famine and deadly wild animals, and they will ravage you and cause you to perish. Disease and bloodshed will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 6:1) 
Then the word of the Lord came directly to me, His prophet, saying:

(Ezekiel 6:2) 
Son of Man, turn your attention towards the mountainous regions of Israel. Prophesy against them, and tell them:

(Ezekiel 6:3) 
You mountains of Israel, listen to the message of the Lord God! The Lord God says this to the mountains, the hills, the rocky outcrops, and the valleys: 'Behold, I am about to bring war upon you, and I will utterly destroy your pagan shrines and places of idol worship.'

(Ezekiel 6:4) 
I will demolish your pagan altars, and I will shatter your idol-statues. I will cast down the corpses of your slain worshippers right in front of your useless idols.

(Ezekiel 6:5) 
I will also spread the corpses of the children of Israel before your idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars, desecrating them.

(Ezekiel 6:6) 
In all the places where you live, your cities will become deserted ruins, and your pagan shrines will be torn down. Your idol-statues will be utterly shattered and broken to pieces, your detestable images will cease to exist, and all your evil works will be completely erased.

(Ezekiel 6:7) 
Many of your people will fall dead in your midst, and then you will truly know that I am the Lord, the one true God.

(Ezekiel 6:8) 
But I will allow some of your people to survive, preserving a remnant from the nation, even when you are scattered and dispersed throughout the various lands among foreign peoples.

(Ezekiel 6:9) 
And those who escape and flee from you into the foreign nations where they have been led captive, they will remember Me. They will remember how I broke their spiritually unfaithful heart, which had strayed far from Me, and their eyes, which lusted after their idols. They will detest themselves for all the evil things and abominations they have committed.

(Ezekiel 6:10) 
And they will then know for certain that I, the Lord, have not spoken idly or in vain, and that I have indeed brought all these calamities and evils upon them, exactly as I promised.

(Ezekiel 6:11) 
This is what the Lord God says: 'Strike your hand together in despair! Stamp your foot on the ground in mourning! And cry out, 'Alas, for the mountains of Israel!' For all the utterly evil abominations committed by the entire house of Israel, they are about to perish by war, by starvation, and by plague.

(Ezekiel 6:12) 
Those who are far away will die from plague. Those who are close by will fall in war. And those who survive and are trapped in besieged cities will die from starvation. In this way, I will completely unleash My furious wrath upon them.

(Ezekiel 6:13) 
Then you will know that I am truly the Lord, when your slain people lie dead among your idols, all around your pagan altars. This will happen on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every leafy tree, and under every dense oak tree—these are the very places where you offered sweet-smelling incense to all your detestable idols.

(Ezekiel 6:14) 
And I will stretch out My judging hand against them. I will turn their land into a desolate and uninhabitable wasteland, from the desert of Diblah across all the places where they dwell. And then they will know without a doubt that I am the Lord, the one true God.

(Ezekiel 7:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 7:2) 
“And you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: ‘The end has come, the end is coming upon all parts of the land.

(Ezekiel 7:3) 
Now the end is upon you. I will send My wrath upon you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all the consequences of your abominations upon you.

(Ezekiel 7:4) 
My eye will not spare you, nor will I have mercy. Instead, I will bring the consequences of your ways upon you, and your abominations will be made clear in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 7:5) 
This is what the Lord God says: ‘A single, unique disaster — behold, it comes!

(Ezekiel 7:6) 
The end has come, the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it comes!

(Ezekiel 7:7) 
The dawn of your judgment has come upon you, you who dwell in the land. The time has come; the day of slaughter is near, and there will be no joyful shouts on the mountains.

(Ezekiel 7:8) 
Now My day is near, that I may pour out My burning anger upon you and fulfill My fury in you. I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all the consequences of your abominations upon you.

(Ezekiel 7:9) 
My eye will not spare you, nor will I have mercy. Instead, I will bring the consequences of your ways upon you, and your abominations will be made clear in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord, who has struck you.’

(Ezekiel 7:10) 
Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! The dawn has arrived. The rod of punishment has blossomed, and pride has fully sprouted.

(Ezekiel 7:11) 
Violence has risen into a rod of wickedness. Nothing is left of them, neither of their crowd, nor of any part of them; there is no peace among them.

(Ezekiel 7:12) 
The time has come, the day has drawn near. Let him who buys not rejoice, and let him who sells not mourn, for wrath is upon all its people.

(Ezekiel 7:13) 
For the seller will not return to what was sold, even if he remains among the living, for their lives will not be strengthened. The vision of their future will not return to all their multitude, and no man will be made strong by the wickedness of his life.

(Ezekiel 7:14) 
Blow the trumpet, prepare everything! Yet no one goes forth to battle, because My wrath is upon all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 7:15) 
The sword is outside, and pestilence and famine are inside. Whoever is in the open country will die by the sword, and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will consume him.

(Ezekiel 7:16) 
And those who flee from them will be saved, but they will be on the mountains like trembling doves of the valleys, each one overwhelmed by his own iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:17) 
All hands will hang limp, and every knee will become weak as water.

(Ezekiel 7:18) 
And they will gird themselves with sackcloth; terror will cover them. Shame will be on every face, and all their heads will be shaved bald in mourning.

(Ezekiel 7:19) 
They will cast their silver into the streets, and their gold will be as refuse. Their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them on the day of the Lord’s wrath. They will not satisfy their souls, nor will they fill their bellies, because their wealth became a stumbling block for their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:20) 
They used their beautiful jewelry for pride, and they made from it images of their abominations and their idols. Therefore, I have given it to them as an unclean and defiled thing.

(Ezekiel 7:21) 
And I will give it into the hands of foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked of the land as prey, and they will defile it.

(Ezekiel 7:22) 
And I will turn My face away from them, and they will defile My secret, holy place (the Temple). Plunderers will come to them and defile it.

(Ezekiel 7:23) 
‘Make a chain, for the land is full of bloody violence, and the city is full of iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:24) 
Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will make the pride of the powerful cease, and they will possess their sanctuaries.

(Ezekiel 7:25) 
Anguish will come upon them. They will seek peace, but there will be none.

(Ezekiel 7:26) 
Disturbance upon disturbance will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will seek a vision from the prophet, but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

(Ezekiel 7:27) 
The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with sorrow. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled and paralyzed. I will bring their ways back upon them, and I will judge them by their own judgments. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”

(Ezekiel 8:8:1) 
And it happened in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month (that is, the sixth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, meaning 592 BC). I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, and the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there.

(Ezekiel 8:8:2) 
And I looked, and behold, I saw a figure like the appearance of fire. From what appeared to be its loins downward, there was fire. And from its loins upward, there was an appearance of brightness, like the shining vision of electrum (a gleaming, golden-silver alloy).

(Ezekiel 8:8:3) 
And a likeness of a hand was sent out and took hold of me by the hair of my head. And the Spirit lifted me between the earth and the sky (the atmosphere), and brought me to Jerusalem in a divine vision, to the inner gate that faced north. There, the idol of jealousy (a pagan image that provoked God's wrath) had been set up, stirring Him to rivalry.

(Ezekiel 8:8:4) 
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as in the vision I had seen in the plain.

(Ezekiel 8:8:5) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, lift your eyes toward the way of the North." And I lifted my eyes toward the way of the North, and behold, to the north of the altar gate, there was the idol of jealousy right at the entrance itself.

(Ezekiel 8:8:6) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, do you really see what these people are doing? The house of Israel is committing exceedingly great abominations here, so much so that I must withdraw far from My sanctuary. And turning again, you will see even greater abominations."

(Ezekiel 8:8:7) 
And He brought me to the door of the (inner) courtyard, and I looked, and behold, there was a single hole in the wall.

(Ezekiel 8:8:8) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, dig through the wall." And when I had dug through the wall, behold, there was a single door.

(Ezekiel 8:8:9) 
And He said to me, "Enter, and see the most wicked abominations that these people are doing here."

(Ezekiel 8:8:10) 
So I entered and saw. And behold, every likeness of creeping things, and detestable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were depicted on the wall all around the entire room.

(Ezekiel 8:8:11) 
And seventy elders of the house of Israel were standing before them (the depicted idols), with Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, as a chief among them. Each man had a censer in his hand, and the cloud of ascending incense filled the room.

(Ezekiel 8:8:12) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness? Each one is in the secret chamber of his (idolatrous) wall, for they say, 'The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.'"

(Ezekiel 8:8:13) 
And He said to me, "Turning again, you will yet see even greater abominations that these people are doing."

(Ezekiel 8:8:14) 
And He brought me through the door of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faced north. And behold, there were women sitting, weeping for Adonis (a pagan god whose death was lamented in fertility rites).

(Ezekiel 8:8:15) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man? Turning again, you will yet see abominations even greater than these."

(Ezekiel 8:8:16) 
And He brought me into the inner courtyard of the house of the Lord. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the vestibule (the porch leading into the temple) and the altar, there were about twenty-five men. They had their backs to the temple of the Lord (turning their backs on God's true worship), and their faces were toward the East, and they were worshiping the rising sun toward the East.

(Ezekiel 8:8:17) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man? Is it a light thing for the house of Judah that they have committed these abominations here? For they have filled the land with iniquity, and they have turned again and again to provoke Me. And behold, they even put the branch (a symbol of pagan ritual) to their nostrils (in contempt or pagan veneration)."

(Ezekiel 8:8:18) 
Therefore, I Myself will deal with them in fury. My eye will not spare them, nor will I have pity. And when they cry to My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

(Ezekiel 9:9:1) 
And he cried out into my hearing with a loud voice, saying: "The time for the city's judgment has drawn near, and each man has an instrument of destruction in his hand."

(Ezekiel 9:9:2) 
And behold, six men were coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each of them had an instrument of destruction in his hand. There was also one man among them, clothed in linen, who had a writer's inkhorn at his waist. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.

(Ezekiel 9:9:3) 
And the Glory of the Lord of Israel, which had been above the cherubim, was taken up and moved to the threshold of the Temple. He then called the man who was clothed in linen, and who had the writer's inkhorn at his waist.

(Ezekiel 9:9:4) 
And the Lord said to him: "Go through the midst of the city, right through the heart of Jerusalem. Mark with the sign of the cross (the letter Tau) on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and mourning over all the abominations that are being committed in its midst."

(Ezekiel 9:9:5) 
And to the other six, He said, while I listened: "Go through the city and strike them down! Let your eye not spare anyone, and show no pity."

(Ezekiel 9:9:6) 
"Kill all the old men, young men, virgins, little children, and women until utter destruction. But anyone on whom you see the mark of the cross, do not kill him. And begin the slaughter at My sanctuary, the Temple." So they began with the elder men who were in front of the Temple.

(Ezekiel 9:9:7) 
And He said to them: "Defile the Temple, and fill its courtyards with the slain. Go forth now!" And they went forth and began to strike down those who were in the city.

(Ezekiel 9:9:8) 
And it came to pass, as they were striking them down, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face. I cried out and said: "Alas, alas, alas! O Lord God, will You then destroy all the remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath upon Jerusalem?"

(Ezekiel 9:9:9) 
And He said to me: "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of perversion. For they have said: 'The Lord has abandoned the land, and the Lord does not see what we do.'"

(Ezekiel 9:9:10) 
"Therefore, My eye will also not spare, nor will I have pity. I will bring their conduct and consequences directly upon their own heads."

(Ezekiel 9:9:11) 
And behold, the man who was clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn at his waist, reported back, saying: "I have done exactly as You commanded me."

(Ezekiel 10:1) 
And I looked, and behold, in the created expanse that was above the heads of the cherubim, something appeared to them that looked like a sapphire stone, resembling the appearance of a throne.

(Ezekiel 10:2) 
Then He spoke to the man who was clothed in linen, instructing him: “Go into the midst of the wheels that are beneath the cherubim. Fill your hand with burning coals that are between the cherubim, and then pour them over the city as judgment.” And the man entered in my sight.

(Ezekiel 10:3) 
Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the Temple as the man entered, and a thick cloud, signifying God's presence, filled the inner court.

(Ezekiel 10:4) 
And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the Temple. The Temple itself was filled with the cloud of God's presence, and the court was filled with the radiant splendor of the Lord's glory.

(Ezekiel 10:5) 
The sound of the cherubim's wings could be heard even as far as the outer court, a sound like the very voice of Almighty God speaking.

(Ezekiel 10:6) 
So when He had given the command to the man clothed in linen, saying: “Take fire from the midst, specifically from among the wheels of the cherubim,” the man then entered and stood beside one of the wheels.

(Ezekiel 10:7) 
Then a cherub reached out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was located between them. He took some of the fire and placed it into the hands of the man who was clothed in linen. The man received it and then went out.

(Ezekiel 10:8) 
And it was seen on the cherubim that there was what looked like a human hand under their wings.

(Ezekiel 10:9) 
And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels positioned beside the cherubim — one wheel next to each cherub. The appearance of these wheels was like the sparkling vision of a chrysolite stone.

(Ezekiel 10:10) 
All four wheels had the same integrated appearance, like a single divine chariot, as if one wheel were set within another.

(Ezekiel 10:11) 
When the wheels moved, they went in their four primary directions without needing to turn as they moved. Rather, wherever the first wheel was impulsed to go, the others followed, maintaining their orientation.

(Ezekiel 10:12) 
And their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the very wheels of all four of them, were completely full of eyes all around, signifying divine knowledge and omnipresence.

(Ezekiel 10:13) 
These are the same wheels which I had previously heard being called 'the whirling ones' — implying constant motion and intricate design.

(Ezekiel 10:14) 
And each cherub had four distinct faces: one face was the face of a cherub (which means it had the form of a winged bull); the second face was the face of a man; the third face was the face of a lion; and the fourth face was the face of an eagle.

(Ezekiel 10:15) 
And the cherubim themselves were then lifted up. For this was the very same type of living creature that I had seen earlier by the Chebar River.

(Ezekiel 10:16) 
And when the cherubim moved forward, the wheels also moved alongside them. When the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels, in the same synchronized manner, did not change their relative position but ascended with them.

(Ezekiel 10:17) 
When the cherubim stood still, the wheels also stood still. When the cherubim ascended, the wheels ascended along with them simultaneously. This perfect coordination was because the spirit of life, a divine animating force, was in both the creatures and the wheels.

(Ezekiel 10:18) 
And the glory of the Lord, God's manifest presence, then moved out from the threshold of the Temple itself and came to rest upon the cherubim.

(Ezekiel 10:19) 
And the cherubim lifted their wings, and the wheels alongside them, and they were lifted up from the earth and departed. Then the entire manifestation of God's glory stood at the entrance of the eastern gate of the Lord's Temple, and the radiant glory of the God of Israel was positioned over them.

(Ezekiel 10:20) 
This was the very same living creature that I had seen beneath the glorious manifestation of the God of Israel by the Chebar River. And at that moment, I finally understood that these creatures were cherubim.

(Ezekiel 10:21) 
Each cherub had four faces, and each had four wings. And there was the appearance of human hands under their wings.

(Ezekiel 10:22) 
And the likeness of their faces was indeed the same faces that I had seen by the Chebar River. Their manner of moving and their very presence were unchanged. Each of them moved straight forward, according to the direction of its face.

(Ezekiel 11:1) 
Then God's Spirit lifted me up, and in this prophetic vision, carried me to the eastern gate of the Lord’s Temple, the one facing the rising sun. And there, at the entrance of the gate, were twenty-five men. Among them, I saw Jazania, the son of Azur, and Pheltya, the son of Banaiah; these were prominent leaders among the people.

(Ezekiel 11:2) 
And the Lord said to me: “Son of Man, these are the very men who plot evil and devise wicked schemes against this city, Jerusalem.”

(Ezekiel 11:3) 
They boast, saying: ‘Isn't it true that new houses are to be built soon? This city is like a protective cooking pot, and we are the choice meat, safe inside it!’

(Ezekiel 11:4) 
Therefore, Son of Man, prophesy against them! Declare God's judgment upon them!

(Ezekiel 11:5) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon me, and He commanded me: “Speak! This is what the Lord says: O house of Israel, indeed, these are the words you have spoken. And I know every secret thought of your hearts!”

(Ezekiel 11:6) 
“You have murdered many people in this city, filling its streets with the slain bodies of your victims.”

(Ezekiel 11:7) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The corpses of those you have murdered and left in the city — *they* are the 'meat' in the 'pot' (Jerusalem). And as for you, I will forcefully remove you from this city,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:8) 
“You have brought the sword of violence upon others, and now I will bring the sword of judgment upon you,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:9) 
“I will drive you out from the midst of Jerusalem, and I will hand you over to your enemies, and I will execute my divine judgments against you.”

(Ezekiel 11:10) 
“You will fall by the sword. I will carry out my judgment against you within the very borders of Israel, so that you will know with certainty that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 11:11) 
“Indeed, Jerusalem will not be a protective pot for you, nor will you be safe meat within it. I will execute judgment against you within the borders of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 11:12) 
“And then you will know that I am the Lord. For you have not lived according to My commands, nor have you performed My judgments. Instead, you have acted according to the wicked practices of the surrounding pagan nations.”

(Ezekiel 11:13) 
It happened that as I was prophesying, Pheltya, the son of Banaiah, suddenly died. Overwhelmed, I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice: “Oh, alas, alas, Lord God! Are You going to completely destroy the small remnant of Israel that remains?”

(Ezekiel 11:14) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 11:15) 
“Son of Man, your brothers, your own relatives, and the entire house of Israel who are in exile — these are the ones about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem arrogantly declared: ‘Stay far away from the Lord! This land has been given exclusively to *us* as our possession!’”

(Ezekiel 11:16) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Although I have sent them far away among the nations, and even though I have scattered them throughout various lands, I will nonetheless be a sacred dwelling for them — a little sanctuary, a place of holiness — in the very lands where they have been sent as exiles.”

(Ezekiel 11:17) 
“Therefore, speak to them and say: This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from among the peoples, and I will bring you together from the lands where I have scattered you, and I will restore to you the land of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 11:18) 
“And when they return to that land, they will remove all its detestable idols and all its abominable practices from it.”

(Ezekiel 11:19) 
“And I will give them a unified heart, and I will place a new spirit within their innermost beings. I will take away their heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, one that is responsive to Me.”

(Ezekiel 11:20) 
“I will do this so that they may live according to My commands, observe My judgments, and actually do them. In this way, they will truly be My people, and I will truly be their God.”

(Ezekiel 11:21) 
“But as for those whose hearts persist in following their detestable idols and abominable practices, I will bring their own sinful ways down upon their own heads,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:22) 
Then the cherubim lifted their wings, and the chariot wheels moved with them, and the majestic glory of the God of Israel was still above them.

(Ezekiel 11:23) 
And the glorious presence of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and then it stood above the mountain located to the east of the city — which is the Mount of Olives.

(Ezekiel 11:24) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up again and, in a vision from God's Spirit, brought me back to Chaldea, where the exiles lived. And after this, the vision I had seen was removed from me.

(Ezekiel 11:25) 
And I immediately spoke to the exiled people all the words of the Lord which He had revealed to me.

(Ezekiel 12:1) 
Then the Lord spoke to me directly.

(Ezekiel 12:2) 
Son of Man, you are living among a truly rebellious people. They have eyes to see what I am doing, but they refuse to see, and they have ears to hear my words, but they refuse to listen, because they are a rebellious people.

(Ezekiel 12:3) 
Therefore, Son of Man, gather your belongings as if preparing for exile. During the daytime, in their full sight, you are to leave your home and go to another place, as if going into exile. Perhaps by doing this, they will finally see and understand that they are a rebellious people.

(Ezekiel 12:4) 
Then, in their sight, you are to bring out your belongings, as if you are someone going into exile during the day. But then, as evening falls, you yourself are to go out, in their sight, just as a person goes into exile.

(Ezekiel 12:5) 
While they watch, dig a hole through the wall of your house, and go out through it.

(Ezekiel 12:6) 
Carry your belongings out on your shoulder in the dark, in their sight. You will go out into the night, and your face will be covered so you cannot see the land. I am making you a prophetic sign for the people of Israel.

(Ezekiel 12:7) 
So I did exactly as the Lord commanded me. During the day, I brought out my baggage as if I were going into exile. Then, as evening came, I used my hands to dig a hole through the wall of my house. In the dark, I went out, carrying my belongings on my shoulder, all in their full sight.

(Ezekiel 12:8) 
The next morning, the Lord spoke to me again.

(Ezekiel 12:9) 
Son of Man, didn't the rebellious people of Israel ask you, 'What are you doing?'

(Ezekiel 12:10) 
Tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: This prophetic action concerns Jerusalem and all the people of Israel who live within it.'

(Ezekiel 12:11) 
Say this: 'I, Ezekiel, am a sign to you. Just as I have acted, so it will happen to them: they will be led away into exile and captivity.'

(Ezekiel 12:12) 
The leader among them, the king, will carry his belongings on his shoulder and go out in the dark. He will dig a hole through the wall to bring his provisions out through it. His face will be covered, so he will not see the land with his own eyes.

(Ezekiel 12:13) 
I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my traps. I will lead him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans. Even though he will arrive there, he will not see that land with his own eyes, and there he will die.

(Ezekiel 12:14) 
And all who are around him, his personal guard, and all his troops, I will scatter to every direction of the wind. I will draw a sword and pursue them.

(Ezekiel 12:15) 
Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them across many lands.

(Ezekiel 12:16) 
But I will spare a few of them from death by sword, famine, and plague. These survivors will then confess all their wicked deeds among the nations where they are scattered. In doing so, they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 12:17) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Ezekiel 12:18) 
Son of Man, you must eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with shaking and deep anxiety.

(Ezekiel 12:19) 
Then you are to say to the people of the land: 'This is what the Lord God declares to those who live in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in utter desolation. This will happen so that the land becomes desolate, emptying itself of its many inhabitants, because of the wickedness of all who live there.'

(Ezekiel 12:20) 
All the inhabited cities will become desolate, and the land itself will turn into an uncultivated wilderness. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 12:21) 
Again, the Lord's word came to me:

(Ezekiel 12:22) 
Son of Man, what is this proverb that you have among you in the land of Israel, that says: 'The days drag on, and every prophetic vision turns out to be false'?

(Ezekiel 12:23) 
Therefore, tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: I will put an end to this proverb, and it will no longer be spoken in Israel. Instead, tell them: The day of fulfillment is drawing near, and so is the outcome of every prophetic vision.'

(Ezekiel 12:24) 
For there will no longer be any false visions or misleading divinations among the children of Israel.

(Ezekiel 12:25) 
For I am the Lord, and what I speak will come to pass. My word will be fulfilled, and there will be no further delay. Indeed, in your lifetime, you rebellious people, I will speak my word, and I will bring it to pass, declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 12:26) 
Once more, the Lord's word came to me:

(Ezekiel 12:27) 
Son of Man, listen to what the people of Israel are saying: 'The vision this man Ezekiel sees is for a distant future, and he prophesies about events far off in time!'

(Ezekiel 12:28) 
Therefore, tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: None of my words will be delayed any longer. Every word I have spoken will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God.'

(Ezekiel 13:1) 
God's message then came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 13:2) 
"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying right now. Prophesy and say to those who prophesy from their own thoughts and desires, not from God: 'Listen to the message of the Lord!'"

(Ezekiel 13:3) 
"Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow only their own thoughts and desires and see no true vision from God!"

(Ezekiel 13:4) 
"Your prophets, O Israel, are like scavenging foxes in empty ruins."

(Ezekiel 13:5) 
"You have not risen up to face the enemy, nor have you built a protective wall for the house of Israel, so that it might stand firm in battle on the day of the Lord's judgment."

(Ezekiel 13:6) 
"They have seen false visions and divined lies, claiming, 'Thus says the Lord,' when the Lord had not sent them. Yet they persisted in trying to make their own deceptive words come true."

(Ezekiel 13:7) 
"Have you not seen false visions and spoken lying divinations, saying, 'Thus says the Lord,' when I myself have not spoken to you?"

(Ezekiel 13:8) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have spoken falsehoods and seen lying visions, behold, I am against you, says the Lord God."

(Ezekiel 13:9) 
"My hand will be upon the prophets who see false visions and divine lies. They will not be included in the assembly of My people, nor will their names be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, and they will not enter the promised land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God."

(Ezekiel 13:10) 
"This is because they have deceived My people, constantly proclaiming, 'Peace!' when there is no true peace. And when the people attempt to build a weak wall for protection, these prophets plaster it over with flimsy mortar that has no straw, making it even weaker."

(Ezekiel 13:11) 
"Tell those who plaster with flimsy mortar that their wall will collapse! For I will send a torrential downpour, and I will unleash great hailstones from above, and a violent, scattering storm wind."

(Ezekiel 13:12) 
"When the wall collapses, will people not then ask you, 'Where is the shoddy plaster you used?'"

(Ezekiel 13:13) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will pour out My wrath like a torrential flood, and My fury will bring forth hailstones that consume everything, and a destructive storm wind."

(Ezekiel 13:14) 
"I will tear down the wall you plastered with flimsy mortar, bringing it crashing to the ground. Its very foundation will be exposed, and when it falls, you yourselves will be crushed in its rubble. Then you will know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 13:15) 
"I will completely spend My wrath upon the wall and upon those who plastered it with flimsy mortar. Then I will declare to you: 'There is no wall left, and there are no plasterers either!'"

(Ezekiel 13:16) 
"These are the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, who see visions of peace for her when, in fact, there is no peace," says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 13:17) 
"And you, son of man, set your face against the women of your people who prophesy from their own thoughts and desires. Prophesy against them!"

(Ezekiel 13:18) 
"And say: 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to those who sew magic armbands for every wrist and make special head-coverings for people of every age, all in order to ensnare souls! They trap the souls of My people, while ensuring their own souls prosper."

(Ezekiel 13:19) 
"You have profaned My holy name before My people for a mere handful of barley and a few crumbs of bread. You put to death those souls who were not destined to die, and you promise life to those souls who were not destined to live, all by lying to My people who readily believe your falsehoods."

(Ezekiel 13:20) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your magic armbands with which you ensnare souls like flying birds! I will tear them from your arms and release the souls you have trapped, those souls meant to be free."

(Ezekiel 13:21) 
"I will also tear apart your special head-coverings and deliver My people from your power. They will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 13:22) 
"This is because you have falsely made the heart of the righteous sad, those whom I Myself had not intended to grieve. And you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, encouraging them not to turn back from their evil ways and repent to live."

(Ezekiel 13:23) 
"Therefore, you will no longer see false visions or practice divination in the future. I will rescue My people from your power. Then you will truly know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 14:1) 
And then, men from the elders of Israel came to me, and they sat down before me.

(Ezekiel 14:2) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 14:3) 
Son of man, these men have cherished their idols deep within their hearts, and they have placed the stumbling block of their sins directly before themselves. So, when they come to inquire of Me, should I even answer them?

(Ezekiel 14:4) 
Therefore, speak to them, and tell them: 'This is what the Lord God says: Any man, any man from the house of Israel, who cherishes his idols in his heart, and places the stumbling block of his sins directly before himself, and then comes to a prophet to inquire of Me—I, the Lord, will answer him, but My answer will be a judgment fitting the multitude of his idols.'

(Ezekiel 14:5) 
I will do this to catch the house of Israel by their own hearts, for they have all strayed far from Me because of their idols.

(Ezekiel 14:6) 
Therefore, say to the house of Israel: 'This is what the Lord God says: Repent and turn away from your idols! Turn your faces away from all your detestable practices!'

(Ezekiel 14:7) 
For every man from the house of Israel, and even any foreigner who lives among you, if he separates himself from Me and cherishes his idols in his heart, and places the stumbling block of his sins directly before himself, and then comes to a prophet to inquire of Me—I, the Lord, will answer him directly by Myself.

(Ezekiel 14:8) 
And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him an example and a warning. I will cut him off from the midst of My people, and then you shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 14:9) 
And if a prophet is deceived and speaks a false word, it is because I, the Lord, have allowed that prophet to be led astray, as a judgment upon the inquirer. And I will stretch out My hand against that prophet and destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.

(Ezekiel 14:10) 
So they will bear their guilt. The guilt of the prophet will be the same as the guilt of the one who inquired of him, because both were in sin.

(Ezekiel 14:11) 
This is so that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, and no longer defile themselves with all their sins. Instead, they shall be My people, and I will be their God, says the Lord of hosts.

(Ezekiel 14:12) 
And the word of the Lord came to me again, saying:

(Ezekiel 14:13) 
Son of man, when a land sins against Me by breaking My commandments and committing a serious trespass, I will stretch out My hand against it. I will break its supply of food, bringing famine upon it, and I will cut off from it both man and beast.

(Ezekiel 14:14) 
Even if these three righteous men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the midst of that land, they would only deliver their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord of hosts.

(Ezekiel 14:15) 
If I bring savage beasts upon that land to devastate it, and it becomes so desolate that no one can pass through because of the wild animals,

(Ezekiel 14:16) 
even if these three men were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither sons nor daughters. Only they themselves would be delivered, but the land would be utterly laid waste.

(Ezekiel 14:17) 
Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and command it, saying: 'Sword, sweep through the land!'—and I cut off from it both man and beast,

(Ezekiel 14:18) 
even if these three men were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.

(Ezekiel 14:19) 
Or if I send a devastating plague upon that land, and pour out My fury upon it with bloodshed, cutting off from it both man and beast,

(Ezekiel 14:20) 
even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither son nor daughter. Only they themselves, by their righteousness, would deliver their own souls.

(Ezekiel 14:21) 
For this is what the Lord God says: 'How much worse will it be when I send My four most severe judgments—the sword, and the famine, and the savage beasts, and the plague—upon Jerusalem, to cut off from it both man and beast?'

(Ezekiel 14:22) 
Yet, a remnant will be saved in it—sons and daughters who will be brought out from Jerusalem. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their wicked ways and their evil deeds. Then you will find comfort concerning the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem, concerning all that I have brought upon it.

(Ezekiel 14:23) 
You will be comforted when you see their ways and their deeds, and you will know that I did not bring all of this upon Jerusalem for no reason, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 15:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 15:2) 
“Son of man, what is the wood of a vine worth compared to all other trees of the forest? What is a branch from a vine among the trees of the groves? The Lord asks this to highlight its lack of inherent value.

(Ezekiel 15:3) 
Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can a peg be taken from it to hang any vessel upon it? The answer is no, because vine wood is weak and unsuitable for construction or support.

(Ezekiel 15:4) 
Look, it is given to the fire as fuel. The fire consumes both of its ends, and its middle is scorched. Will any of it be useful for work then? No, it only serves to burn.

(Ezekiel 15:5) 
Even when it was whole and unburnt, it wasn't suitable for any work. How much less will anything useful be made from it after the fire has consumed it and it has been scorched? Nothing at all.

(Ezekiel 15:6) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Just as the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest is given to the fire as fuel, so will I hand over the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They are like useless vine wood, destined for destruction due to their unfruitfulness.

(Ezekiel 15:7) 
And I will set my face against them, meaning my judgment will be upon them. Though they have escaped some previous judgment or disaster, another fire will consume them completely. And you will know that I am the Lord when I have set my face against them in judgment.

(Ezekiel 15:8) 
And I will make their land an impassable and desolate wilderness, because they have been unfaithful and rebellious against my covenant,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:1) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 16:2) 
“Son of man, show Jerusalem its detestable actions,

(Ezekiel 16:3) 
and say, ‘These are the words of the Lord God to Jerusalem: “Your origins and your family come from the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.”

(Ezekiel 16:4) 
“At the time of your birth, on the day you were born, your umbilical cord wasn't cut, and you weren't washed clean with water to make you healthy, nor were you salted to cleanse you, nor were you wrapped in cloths.

(Ezekiel 16:5) 
“No one looked upon you with pity, to do any of these things for you. No one had mercy on you. Instead, you were thrown out in a field on the day you were born, despised because you were a child.

(Ezekiel 16:6) 
“As I passed by you, I saw you trampled in your own blood. And I said to you, ‘Live!’ I said to you, ‘Live!’

(Ezekiel 16:7) 
“I caused you to grow like a plant of the field. You grew and became great. You attained the beauty of a woman, and your breasts developed, and your hair grew. But you were naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:8) 
“Then I passed by you again and saw that it was the time of love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness, and I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord God. “And so you became mine.

(Ezekiel 16:9) 
“Then I washed you with water and washed away your blood. I anointed you with oil.

(Ezekiel 16:10) 
“I clothed you with embroidered cloth, and I put sandals of fine leather on your feet, and I wrapped you in fine linen.

(Ezekiel 16:11) 
“I adorned you with jewelry and put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck.

(Ezekiel 16:12) 
“I put a ring in your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.

(Ezekiel 16:13) 
“You were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful, and you advanced to the position of queen.

(Ezekiel 16:14) 
“Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty. It was perfect because of my splendor that I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:15) 
“But you were confident in your beauty, and you played the prostitute because of your fame. You poured out your prostitution on every passerby, and you gave yourself to them.

(Ezekiel 16:16) 
“You took your jewelry of gold and silver, which I had given you, and made male images and committed prostitution with them.

(Ezekiel 16:17) 
“You took the clothing I had given you and covered them with it. You set my oil and my incense before them.

(Ezekiel 16:18) 
“And you set before them the bread I gave you, the fine flour, oil, and honey that I fed you, as a soothing fragrance. It happened,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:19) 
“You took your sons and daughters, whom you had borne to me, and sacrificed them to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution too little?

(Ezekiel 16:20) 
“You slaughtered my sons and gave them to them, consecrating them, giving them over to them.

(Ezekiel 16:21) 
“In all your acts of prostitution, you didn’t remember your days as a child, when you were naked and rolling in your own blood.

(Ezekiel 16:22) 
“After all your abominations and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and ashamed, rolling in your blood.

(Ezekiel 16:23) 
“And it happened, after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you!), says the Lord God,

(Ezekiel 16:24) 
“that you built yourself a brothel and made yourself a high place in every street.

(Ezekiel 16:25) 
“At every crossroads, you built a head, and you defiled your beauty and spread your legs to every passerby, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.

(Ezekiel 16:26) 
“You committed prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors, whose bodies were large, and you multiplied your prostitution, provoking me.

(Ezekiel 16:27) 
“Therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against you and reduce your allowance. I will give you over to the will of your daughters, who hate you. I will take you away.

(Ezekiel 16:28) 
“And I will hand you over to them, and they will tear down your brothel and destroy your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take away your jewelry, and they will leave you naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:29) 
“I will expose your nakedness and your prostitution and your foolishness. I will bring you down in disgrace and hand you over to them.

(Ezekiel 16:30) 
“I will do these things to you because you have committed prostitution with the nations and have defiled yourself with their idols.

(Ezekiel 16:31) 
“You have walked in the way of your sister, and I will put her cup into your hand.”

(Ezekiel 16:32) 
“You drank the cup of your sister, which was deep and wide. And you became an object of laughter and mockery, unable to hold yourself back.

(Ezekiel 16:33) 
“You were filled with drunkenness and sorrow. It is the cup of your brother that was given to you by the Lord.

(Ezekiel 16:34) 
“You will drink from it and drain it. You will crush the fragments, and you will break your breasts, because you have forgotten me,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:35) 
“Therefore, I have also given you into the hands of those you hated, because you despised me.

(Ezekiel 16:36) 
“When they come to you, and take you, they will do all their works on you and take away your sons and daughters, and they will kill you with the sword, and leave you famous, and they will carry out your acts of prostitution on you.

(Ezekiel 16:37) 
“And I will judge you according to the judgments of adulteresses and will pour out your blood in fury and zeal.

(Ezekiel 16:38) 
“And I will hand you over to them, and they will tear down your brothel and demolish your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take away your jewelry, and they will leave you naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:39) 
“And they will do these things to you in hatred and with the zeal of fury, and they will take you away and leave you naked in the wilderness.

(Ezekiel 16:40) 
“They will bring up a crowd against you, and they will stone you and crush you, and they will kill you with their swords.

(Ezekiel 16:41) 
“They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women, and I will cause you to cease your prostitution, and you will no longer give gifts.

(Ezekiel 16:42) 
“Then I will satisfy my wrath against you, and my jealousy will depart from you, and I will be at rest, and I will no longer be angry.

(Ezekiel 16:43) 
“Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me in all things, therefore, behold, I, even I, will repay your way upon your head,” says the Lord God, “because you have not committed wickedness above all your abominations.

(Ezekiel 16:44) 
“Behold, everyone who utters a proverb will utter it about you, saying, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’”

(Ezekiel 16:45) 
“You are the daughter of your mother, who abandoned her husband and her sons, and you are the sister of your brothers, who abandoned their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

(Ezekiel 16:46) 
“Your elder sister is Samaria, who lives with her daughters to your left, and your younger sister, who lives to your right, is Sodom and her daughters.

(Ezekiel 16:47) 
“You did not walk in their ways, nor did you do according to their abominations, but it was as if that were too little for you, but you have corrupted more than them in all your ways.

(Ezekiel 16:48) 
“As I live,” says the Lord God, “your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done what you and your daughters have done.

(Ezekiel 16:49) 
“For this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and idleness were in her and in her daughters, and they did not support the hand of the poor and the needy.

(Ezekiel 16:50) 
“They were haughty and committed abominations before me. So I took them away, as you have seen.

(Ezekiel 16:51) 
“And Samaria has not committed even half of your sins. You have multiplied your abominations more than they did, and you have justified your sisters in all your abominations that you have done.

(Ezekiel 16:52) 
“Therefore, bear your shame, since you have judged your sisters. In your sins, which you spared them, they are more righteous than you.

(Ezekiel 16:53) 
“But you also bear your shame, since you have judged your sisters. In your sins, which you spared them, they are more righteous than you, so that you may justify your sisters when you have sinned, and you will be in disgrace, since you have borne them.”

(Ezekiel 16:54) 
“Therefore, turn back, and bear your shame for justifying your sisters.

(Ezekiel 16:55) 
“And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state.

(Ezekiel 16:56) 
“And your sister Sodom did not even speak in your mouth on the day of your pride,

(Ezekiel 16:57) 
before your wickedness was revealed, as in the time of the insults of the daughters of Syria, and all those who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who surrounded you all around.

(Ezekiel 16:58) 
“You have borne your prostitution and your abominations,” says the Lord.

(Ezekiel 16:59) 
“For these are the words of the Lord God: ‘I will deal with you as you have done, since you have despised the oath and broken the covenant.

(Ezekiel 16:60) 
“‘Yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an eternal covenant with you.

(Ezekiel 16:61) 
“‘Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both older and younger, and I will give them to you as daughters, but not as a covenant with you.

(Ezekiel 16:62) 
“‘And I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord,

(Ezekiel 16:63) 
so that you will remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all you have done,’” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 17:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 17:2) 
“Son of man, speak a riddle, and tell a parable to the house of Israel,

(Ezekiel 17:3) 
And say, 'The Lord God says this: A great eagle with great wings, a long flight, full of feathers and varied colors, came to Lebanon, and took a cedar:

(Ezekiel 17:4) 
He broke off the top of its branches, and brought it to the land of Canaan, and placed it in the city of merchants.'

(Ezekiel 17:5) 
He took from the seed of the land, and put it in a land of iniquity, and placed it like a willow by the waters.

(Ezekiel 17:6) 
And it sprouted, and grew into a vine of low stature, and its roots turned towards it, and it sent out its branches toward it.

(Ezekiel 17:7) 
There was therefore a great eagle, having large wings, and many hairs, and full of feathers, which came from Lebanon: and took the cedar.

(Ezekiel 17:8) 
He placed it in a good vine near many waters, to make branches, and bear fruit, and to be a noble vine.

(Ezekiel 17:9) 
Say, 'The Lord God says this: Will it then prosper? Will he not uproot its roots, and take away its fruit, and wither it? All the buds of its germination will wither, and not with great strength, nor with a multitude of people, to uproot it by the roots.

(Ezekiel 17:10) 
Behold, it is planted: will it prosper? Will it not, when the scorching wind touches it, utterly wither, and in the fields of its germination wither?'

(Ezekiel 17:11) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 17:12) 
Say to the house of iniquity: Do you not know what these things mean? Say: Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king and its princes, and brought them with him to Babylon.

(Ezekiel 17:13) 
And he took from the seed of the kingdom, and made a covenant with him, and received an oath from him, but he also removed the powerful of the land:

(Ezekiel 17:14) 
So that the kingdom would be humble, and would not exalt itself, but keep its covenant, and observe it.

(Ezekiel 17:15) 
Who departed from him, and sent his messengers to Egypt, to give him horses and much people: will he prosper, and escape who does these things? Will he who has broken the covenant escape?

(Ezekiel 17:16) 
As I live, says the Lord God, because in the place of the king who established him, he despised him, and broke his covenant, which he made with him: in the midst of Babylon he will die.

(Ezekiel 17:17) 
And not in a great army, nor in a large people, but he will die in war, and his remains will be scattered in every wind: and in this will not be his strength.

(Ezekiel 17:18) 
And he despised the oath, that he might break the covenant, and behold, he has given his hand, and done all these things: he will not escape.

(Ezekiel 17:19) 
Therefore, the Lord God says this: As I live, because my oath, which he despised, and my covenant, which he transgressed, I will put on his head.

(Ezekiel 17:20) 
And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my arrow: and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will judge him there for the iniquity by which he has transgressed against me.

(Ezekiel 17:21) 
And all his fugitives, with all his hand, will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered in every wind: and you will know that I the Lord have spoken.

(Ezekiel 17:22) 
The Lord God says this: And I will take from the top of the high cedar, and plant: from the top of its branches a tender one, and I will break, and I will plant it on a high and eminent mountain.

(Ezekiel 17:23) 
On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it: and it will make branches, and bear fruit, and it will be a magnificent cedar: and all the birds will dwell under it, every flying thing will nest under the shadow of its branches.

(Ezekiel 17:24) 
And all the trees of the region will know that I the Lord have humbled the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and I have dried up the green tree, and caused the dry tree to bear fruit. I the Lord have done it, and I will do it.

(Ezekiel 18:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, and said:

(Ezekiel 18:2) 
“Why do you keep using this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: ‘The parents ate sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are on edge’?

(Ezekiel 18:3) 
“As I live, says the Lord God, this proverb will no longer be used by you in Israel.

(Ezekiel 18:4) 
“Behold, all souls are Mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sins shall die.

(Ezekiel 18:5) 
“Now if a man is just, and does what is right:

(Ezekiel 18:6) 
“He doesn’t eat on the mountains, and doesn’t lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and doesn’t violate the wife of his neighbor, and doesn’t go to a menstruating woman:

(Ezekiel 18:7) 
“He doesn’t hurt any man, doesn’t take interest, and doesn’t take usury; he turns his hand from iniquity, and executes true judgment between man and man:

(Ezekiel 18:8) 
“He walks in My precepts, and keeps My judgments, to do what is true, he is just: he shall live, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 18:9) 
“But if he has begotten a son who is a robber, who sheds blood, and does any of these things:

(Ezekiel 18:10) 
“Who does any of these things, and does everything that his brother did not do, and who eats with these on the mountains, and violates the wife of his neighbor:

(Ezekiel 18:11) 
“He oppresses the poor and the needy, violently extorts plunder, does not restore the pledge, and lifts his eyes to idols, and commits abomination:

(Ezekiel 18:12) 
“He has given interest and taken usury: shall he live? He shall not live: since he has done all these things, he shall die; his blood shall be upon himself.

(Ezekiel 18:13) 
“But if he has begotten a son, who sees all the sins of his father that he has done, and does not do the like:

(Ezekiel 18:14) 
“Who does not eat on the mountains, and does not lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and does not violate the wife of his neighbor:

(Ezekiel 18:15) 
“He does not hurt any man, and does not take a pledge, and does not violently extort plunder, and gives his food to the hungry, and gives his bread to the poor:

(Ezekiel 18:16) 
“He turns his hand from iniquity, does not take interest and does not take usury: he does My judgments, and walks in My precepts: this one shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:17) 
“For the father died in his iniquity: but the son did judgment and justice, he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:18) 
“And you say: ‘Why does not the son bear the iniquity of his father?’ The son did judgment and justice: he has kept all My commandments, and done them: he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:19) 
“The soul that sins shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be with him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be with him.

(Ezekiel 18:20) 
“But if the wicked man does penance for all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My commandments, and does judgment and justice, he shall live: he shall not die.

(Ezekiel 18:21) 
“I will not remember all his iniquities that he has committed: in his justice which he has done, he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:22) 
“Do I desire the death of the wicked, says the Lord God, and not that he be converted from his ways, and live?

(Ezekiel 18:23) 
“But if the just man turns away from his justice, and commits iniquity, according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? I will not remember all his justices that he has done: in the prevarication with which he has prevaricated, and in the sin with which he has sinned, in these shall he die.

(Ezekiel 18:24) 
“And you say: ‘The way of the Lord is not equitable.’ Hear now, house of Israel: is not My way equitable? Rather, your ways are not equitable.

(Ezekiel 18:25) 
“For when the just man turns away from his justice, and commits iniquity, he shall die in them: in the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die.

(Ezekiel 18:26) 
“And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed, and does judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive.

(Ezekiel 18:27) 
“Because he sees and withdraws from all his iniquities which he has committed, he shall live: he shall not die.

(Ezekiel 18:28) 
“And the house of Israel said: ‘The way of the Lord is not equitable.’ Are not My ways equitable, house of Israel? Rather, are not your ways wicked?

(Ezekiel 18:29) 
“Therefore I will judge you according to your ways, house of Israel, says the Lord God. Turn back and do penance from all your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be to you for ruin.

(Ezekiel 18:30) 
“Cast away from yourselves all your iniquities in which you have prevaricated, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: and why do you want to die, house of Israel?

(Ezekiel 18:31) 
“For I do not want the death of him who dies, says the Lord God: turn back, and live.

(Ezekiel 18:32) 
“Because I do not want the death of him that is dying, says the Lord God. Therefore be converted, and live.

(Ezekiel 19:1) 
You should begin a funeral song for the leaders of Israel.

(Ezekiel 19:2) 
Then say: What kind of mother was your leader, a lioness among other lions! She laid down among lions. She raised up her cubs among the lions.

(Ezekiel 19:3) 
One of her cubs became a lion, and learned to kill and devour humans.

(Ezekiel 19:4) 
The nations heard about him. He was caught in their trap. They led him in chains to the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 19:5) 
When his mother saw that her hopes were lost, she took another cub of hers and made him a lion.

(Ezekiel 19:6) 
This one lived among lions, learned to kill, and devoured humans.

(Ezekiel 19:7) 
He began to tear down cities and destroy the lands. The land and its people were laid waste by his roaring.

(Ezekiel 19:8) 
The nations around him gathered against him, and spread their net over him. He was caught in their trap.

(Ezekiel 19:9) 
They put him in a cage, in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon, so that his voice would never be heard again on the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 19:10) 
Your mother was like a vine, planted near the waters. She produced many shoots because she was by many waters.

(Ezekiel 19:11) 
Her strongest branches became the scepters of kings. Her height was exalted to the heavens, and she was raised up among her branches.

(Ezekiel 19:12) 
But she was cast down in anger. The land was trampled, and her fruit was carried away by the wind. Her branches withered and broke, and fire consumed them.

(Ezekiel 19:13) 
Now she is planted in the desert, in a land without water. Fire has come out of her branches and consumed her fruit. There is no strong branch left for a scepter of a kingdom.

(Ezekiel 19:14) 
This is a funeral song; it shall become a funeral song.

(Ezekiel 20:1) 
In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day, the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 20:2) 
“Son of man, direct your face toward Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:3) 
Speak, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of your rivers, that says: ‘My river is my own, and I have made myself.’

(Ezekiel 20:4) 
Because you said: ‘The river is mine, and I have made myself,’ therefore, I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers will stick to your scales.

(Ezekiel 20:5) 
And I will cast you into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall upon the face of the field, and you shall not be gathered, nor taken up. To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky, I have given you to be devoured.

(Ezekiel 20:6) 
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 20:7) 
When they took hold of you with the hand, you broke, and you tore all their shoulder: and when they leaned on you, you broke, and shattered all their loins.

(Ezekiel 20:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and I will cut off from you man and beast.

(Ezekiel 20:9) 
And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.

(Ezekiel 20:10) 
Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring the sword of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon upon Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:11) 
And the hand of him and the hand of his people with him, of the strong peoples: to destroy it.

(Ezekiel 20:12) 
And the swords of the mighty will I cause to fall, and I will crush the pride of Egypt: and I will destroy all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 20:13) 
And I will destroy all its beasts from the many waters: and it shall no longer be bold in the foot of man.

(Ezekiel 20:14) 
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, from the tower of Syene, even to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 20:15) 
And I will set fire in Egypt: it shall be greatly grieved, and dispersed, and shall fall by the sword.

(Ezekiel 20:16) 
Thus says the Lord God: And I will scatter Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and of the mighty peoples with him.

(Ezekiel 20:17) 
He and the people with him, the more powerful of the nations, to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

(Ezekiel 20:18) 
And I will make the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land desolate, and the fullness thereof by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it.

(Ezekiel 20:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will give Egypt to be desolate, desolate from the tower of Syene and to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 20:20) 
And I will give it into the hand of those who devastate it: and I will scatter it among the nations, and will disperse it throughout the countries.

(Ezekiel 20:21) 
And I will strengthen the hands of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groans of the slain.

(Ezekiel 20:22) 
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down: and I will put my sword in the hand of the king of Babylon.

(Ezekiel 20:23) 
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fail: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:24) 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them throughout the countries: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 20:25) 
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 20:26) 
“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:27) 
Speak, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I bring you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, that says: ‘The river is mine, and I made it for myself.’

(Ezekiel 20:28) 
And I will put a hook in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales: and I will bring you out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.

(Ezekiel 20:29) 
And I will give you into the hand of them that devastate you, and they shall scatter you, and tread you down: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 20:30) 
Because you have said: ‘The river is mine, and I made it, and I made myself:’ therefore, I will deliver you into your rivers, and I will cast you with all the fish of your rivers: and I will bring you into the wilderness, into a land of desolation, and you shall not be built up anymore: because I the Lord have spoken it.

(Ezekiel 20:31) 
Thus says the Lord God: When I shall have gathered Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations: and they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 20:32) 
And they shall dwell in it with security, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell with confidence, when I shall have executed judgment in all who afflict them round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.

(Ezekiel 21:1) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:2) 
“Son of man, direct your face against Jerusalem, and look down upon the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

(Ezekiel 21:3) 
and say to the land of Israel: ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw my sword from its sheath, and will cut off from you both the just and the wicked.’

(Ezekiel 21:4) 
Because I will cut off from you the just and the wicked, therefore will I draw my sword from its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north.

(Ezekiel 21:5) 
And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn my sword from its sheath, and it shall not return again.

(Ezekiel 21:6) 
You, therefore, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and in bitterness groan.

(Ezekiel 21:7) 
And when they say to you: ‘Why do you groan?’ say: ‘Because of what is to be heard: because it shall come; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be loosened, and every spirit shall be terrified, and all knees shall be weakened as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord God.’

(Ezekiel 21:8) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:9) 
“Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord: Say: ‘A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.’

(Ezekiel 21:10) 
It is sharpened that it may kill the victims. It is polished that it may cut and flash like lightning. I have given it to the slaughter.

(Ezekiel 21:11) 
And I have polished the sword that it may be held in the hand: against him who kills. So that his heart may be sad, and that ruin may be multiplied.

(Ezekiel 21:12) 
It is made ready to be polished, that it may kill. I have set it in the hand of the slayer.

(Ezekiel 21:13) 
Cry and howl, son of man: because it shall be in my people, and this shall be in all the princes of Israel, delivered to the sword with my people: therefore strike your thigh.

(Ezekiel 21:14) 
For there is a testing. And what if the sword despises? even the rod, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 21:15) 
You, therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hand, and say: ‘The sword, the sword is sharpened and brightened: it is sharpened to be butchered and polished for the great slaughter: that it may kill and crush them.’

(Ezekiel 21:16) 
So that the hearts of men may fear, and that ruin may be multiplied: I have set the sword in all their gates to bring confusion: alas! it is made to flash, and it is fitted for slaughter.

(Ezekiel 21:17) 
I have given the sword sharpened on both sides, that it may kill. Therefore, groaning, strike your hand.

(Ezekiel 21:18) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:19) 
“You, therefore, son of man, mark out two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come from the land: both shall come out of the land: and I will set my hand, and I will set the way at the head of the way of the city.

(Ezekiel 21:20) 
I will set a way for the sword, and the sword shall come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah, and to Jerusalem.

(Ezekiel 21:21) 
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the ways, at the head of the two ways, divining: he has mixed arrows, he has consulted idols, he has consulted the liver.

(Ezekiel 21:22) 
In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to give a ram, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in shouting, to give a ram against the gates, to make a rampart, and to build a fortification.

(Ezekiel 21:23) 
And it shall be as a vain divination in their eyes, who have sworn to him: and he will remember iniquity that he may be taken.

(Ezekiel 21:24) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have made mention of your iniquity, and your transgression is revealed, and your sins have appeared in your thoughts, because you have been made mindful, and you are taken with a hand.’

(Ezekiel 21:25) 
“But you, impious and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come in the last time of iniquity,

(Ezekiel 21:26) 
thus says the Lord God: ‘Remove the turban, and take off the crown: this is not the same; exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.’

(Ezekiel 21:27) 
I will overturn, I will overturn, I will overturn it: and this shall be, until he comes to whom the judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.

(Ezekiel 21:28) 
“And you, son of man, prophesy and say: ‘Thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach: Say: A sword, a sword, is drawn to be butchered, sharpened to crush and to flash:

(Ezekiel 21:29) 
while they see you in vain, while they divine to you lies, that you may set yourself upon the necks of the impious who are slain, whose day has come in the last time of iniquity.’

(Ezekiel 21:30) 
Put it back into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you.

(Ezekiel 21:31) 
And I will pour out my indignation upon you: in the fire of my zeal I will melt you: and I will give you into the hand of cruel men, the craftsmen of wickedness, to be destroyed.

(Ezekiel 21:32) 
You shall be a fire for devouring: your blood shall be in the midst of the land: you shall not be remembered, because I the Lord have spoken.”

(Ezekiel 22:1) 
And the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:2) 
“Son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the city of bloodshed? You will reveal all its abominations to her.

(Ezekiel 22:3) 
And you will say: 'Thus says the Lord God: The city that pours out blood in her midst, so that her time may be accelerated, and makes idols against herself to defile her.

(Ezekiel 22:4) 
In your blood that you have poured out, you have become guilty. And in your idols that you have made, you have become defiled. And you have come close to your days, and have brought your years. Therefore, I have given you as a reproach to the nations and as a mockery to all lands.'

(Ezekiel 22:5) 
‘You are the object of reproach of those nearby, and a mockery to those around you. You will be a thing of name, full of confusion.

(Ezekiel 22:6) 
Behold, the princes of Israel, each one in his own arm, were in you to shed blood.

(Ezekiel 22:7) 
Father and mother they have despised in you. In your midst they have done calumny; the orphan and the widow they have afflicted in you.

(Ezekiel 22:8) 
My holy things they have despised, and my sabbaths they have polluted.

(Ezekiel 22:9) 
Men of detraction were in you to shed blood, and on the mountains they ate in you their wickedness.

(Ezekiel 22:10) 
The shame of the father they have uncovered in you, the uncleanness of the menstruating woman they have humiliated in you.

(Ezekiel 22:11) 
And each one’s abomination with the wife of his neighbor they have done in you, and in impurity a man has confused himself with his wife.

(Ezekiel 22:12) 
They poured out blood in you; they took interest and increase in you, and they have done calumny against your neighbors in you, but they have forgotten me, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 22:13) 
Behold, I have struck my hand against your greed that you have made, and against the blood that has been poured out in your midst.

(Ezekiel 22:14) 
Will your heart endure as in the days of evil? I have brought the sword upon you.

(Ezekiel 22:15) 
I will scatter you among the nations, and I will fan you in the lands, and I will take away from you your impurities.

(Ezekiel 22:16) 
And you will be defiled in yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 22:17) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:18) 
“Son of man, the house of Israel has become for me like the food of all: brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the midst of the furnace. Most impure silver has become for them.

(Ezekiel 22:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have become all like most impure silver, therefore behold, I will gather you in the midst of Jerusalem:

(Ezekiel 22:20) 
As silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin are accustomed to be gathered in the midst of the furnace, so that the fire may blow upon them to melt them: so I will gather you in my fury and in my indignation, and I will put you in the midst of it.

(Ezekiel 22:21) 
And I will gather you, and I will blow upon you the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.

(Ezekiel 22:22) 
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so will you be melted in the midst of it, and you will know that I am the Lord, because I have poured out my indignation upon you.”

(Ezekiel 22:23) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:24) 
“Son of man, say to her: ‘You are a land that is not watered, and rain has not fallen upon you in the day of indignation.

(Ezekiel 22:25) 
‘The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion seizing its prey: they have devoured souls; they have taken money and jewels. They have made widows in her numerous.

(Ezekiel 22:26) 
Her priests have despised my law, and have polluted my holy things. They have not separated between holy and profane, and they have not judged between what is polluted and what is clean, and from my sabbaths they have averted their eyes, and I have been profaned among them.

(Ezekiel 22:27) 
Her princes in her midst are like wolves seizing prey to shed blood and to destroy souls, so that they may make a profit from greed.

(Ezekiel 22:28) 
And her prophets covered for them, smearing for them without mortar, and saying: ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ seeing false visions and divining lies.

(Ezekiel 22:29) 
The people of the land have done calumny and have seized prey; they have afflicted the poor and the beggar, and they have oppressed the stranger against judgment.

(Ezekiel 22:30) 
And I sought among them a man who would repair the wall and stand in the breach against me for the land, so that I would not destroy it, but I did not find one.

(Ezekiel 22:31) 
And I poured out my indignation upon them; in the fire of my wrath I consumed them. I have given their work upon their head, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 23:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 23:2) 
Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.

(Ezekiel 23:3) 
And they committed fornication in Egypt. They committed fornication in their youth. There, their breasts were pressed, and there, the nipples of their virginity were broken.

(Ezekiel 23:4) 
And their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah the younger. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And these are their names: Samaria, Oholah, and Jerusalem, Oholibah.

(Ezekiel 23:5) 
And Oholah committed fornication, though she was mine, and lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, who lived nearby,

(Ezekiel 23:6) 
dressed in hyacinth, captains and rulers, young men eager for war, all chosen, horsemen, and men of war.

(Ezekiel 23:7) 
And she gave her acts of fornication to them, all the chosen sons of the Assyrians, all those in whom was her desire. And she was defiled with their idols.

(Ezekiel 23:8) 
And she did not forsake her acts of fornication from Egypt. For when she slept with him, she lay with him, and she defiled her acts of fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:9) 
And I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.

(Ezekiel 23:10) 
These exposed her nakedness, and took away her sons and her daughters. And they killed Oholah with the sword, and she became a warning to women, when judgment was passed on her.

(Ezekiel 23:11) 
And her sister Oholibah saw this. And lusting, she surpassed her acts of fornication, and more than the other. And her acts of fornication surpassed the acts of her sister.

(Ezekiel 23:12) 
Lusting after the Assyrians, captains and rulers who lived nearby, dressed in finery, horsemen and men of war, all chosen young men.

(Ezekiel 23:13) 
And I saw that she was defiled, for both of them were on the same path.

(Ezekiel 23:14) 
And she multiplied her acts of fornication. For when she saw men painted on the wall, images of the Chaldeans painted in color,

(Ezekiel 23:15) 
with their loins girded and their heads with tiaras, the appearance of captains and rulers, the likenesses of the sons of Babylon, the land of their birth,

(Ezekiel 23:16) 
she lusted after them with her eyes, and she sent messengers to the Chaldeans.

(Ezekiel 23:17) 
And the sons of Babylon came to her in the bed of love, and defiled her in her fornication, and she was defiled in them, and her soul was turned away from them.

(Ezekiel 23:18) 
And she revealed her acts of fornication, and uncovered her nakedness. And my soul was turned away from her, as my soul was turned away from her sister.

(Ezekiel 23:19) 
And she multiplied her acts of fornication, remembering the days of her youth, in which she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 23:20) 
And she lusted after their concubitus, whose flesh was like the flesh of donkeys, and whose seed was like the seed of horses.

(Ezekiel 23:21) 
And you brought back the shame of your youth, and the breaking of your nipples, by the hand of the Egyptians, because of the breasts of your youth.

(Ezekiel 23:22) 
Therefore, Oholah, behold, I will gather all your lovers, for whom you had a mind, and all whom you have loved with all those in whom you lusted: and I will gather them against you from all sides, and I will reveal your nakedness to them, and I will show them all your fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:23) 
And I will judge you with the judgments of adulteresses and those who shed blood, and I will give you to the blood of wrath and zeal.

(Ezekiel 23:24) 
And I will deliver you into their hand, and they will plunder you, and they will tear down your buildings, and take away your garments, and take your vessels of glory. And I will bring you to them, and give you into their hand.

(Ezekiel 23:25) 
And they will bring upon you my fury, and they will make you into the fury of zeal, and take away your nose and your ears. And those who remain will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and your daughters, and those who remain will be burned with fire.

(Ezekiel 23:26) 
And they will take away your garments, and take your vessels of glory.

(Ezekiel 23:27) 
And I will put your memory away from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes towards them, and you will not remember Egypt any more.

(Ezekiel 23:28) 
For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul has turned away.

(Ezekiel 23:29) 
And they will make you hated, and take away everything you have worked for. And they will leave you naked and deserted, and the shame of your fornications and your sins will be revealed.

(Ezekiel 23:30) 
These things will they do to you, because you have committed fornication after the gentiles, and you have been defiled with their idols.

(Ezekiel 23:31) 
You have walked in the way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand.

(Ezekiel 23:32) 
Thus says the Lord God: You will drink your sister's cup, therefore you will give it in your hand, and drink it. And you will mock, and despise, and cease to mourn.

(Ezekiel 23:33) 
For you have filled your sister's cup, and you will give it in your hand, and drink it, and you will drain it to the dregs, and break your bones in pieces.

(Ezekiel 23:34) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have forgotten me, you have cast me behind your back, therefore you will bear your iniquity and your fornications.

(Ezekiel 23:35) 
And the Lord said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? And show them their crimes?

(Ezekiel 23:36) 
And you have given judgment to Oholah and Oholibah, and shown them all their wickedness.

(Ezekiel 23:37) 
Because they have committed fornication, and in their hands are crimes, and they have committed fornication with their idols, and they have given their sons, whom they bore to me, to them for food.

(Ezekiel 23:38) 
But even this they did to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they violated my Sabbaths.

(Ezekiel 23:39) 
And when they had sacrificed their sons to their idols, they came into my sanctuary on the same day to defile it. And behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.

(Ezekiel 23:40) 
For they sent for handsome men coming from afar, to whom messengers were sent. And behold, they came. For whom you washed yourself, and painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments, and placed yourself on a bed.

(Ezekiel 23:41) 
And you sat on a bed of incense, and my table was set before you, upon which you placed my incense and my oil.

(Ezekiel 23:42) 
And there was the voice of a multitude in her, and with men of the common people brought from the desert. And they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their heads.

(Ezekiel 23:43) 
And I said: Will they commit fornication in their old age? And now is their fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:44) 
And they entered to her as to a woman of prostitution. Thus they entered to Oholah and Oholibah, wicked women, and themselves wicked.

(Ezekiel 23:45) 
And just men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and the judgment of those who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

(Ezekiel 23:46) 
For thus says the Lord God: I will bring against them a multitude, and I will give them to be shaken and plundered.

(Ezekiel 23:47) 
And the multitude will stone them with stones, and pierce them with swords, and they will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.

(Ezekiel 23:48) 
And I will remove wickedness from the land, and every woman will be corrected, and they will not act according to your wickedness.

(Ezekiel 23:49) 
And I will bring your wickedness upon you, and you will bear the sins of your idols, and you will know that I am the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 24:1) 
In the ninth year of the exile, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:2) 
“Son of man, write down the name of this very day: The king of Babylon has launched his attack against Jerusalem this very day.”

(Ezekiel 24:3) 
“Then speak a parable to this rebellious house. Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Put the pot on the fire. Put it on the fire, and then pour water into it.’”

(Ezekiel 24:4) 
“‘Put into it every piece of meat: the best pieces, the thigh, and the shoulder. Fill it with choice bones.”

(Ezekiel 24:5) 
“‘Take the best of the flock, and heap the wood together to make it boil. Cook the meat in it.”

(Ezekiel 24:6) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Woe to this city of bloodshed! Woe to this pot, whose rust is in it! The rust has not left it.”

(Ezekiel 24:7) 
“‘She poured blood into it, and put it on a bare rock. She did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dirt.”

(Ezekiel 24:8) 
“‘I have given her blood to be poured on the bare rock. This was to cause wrath, and to take vengeance.”

(Ezekiel 24:9) 
“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Woe to this city of bloodshed! I will make the pyre of wood great, and I will cause the fire to burn hot.”

(Ezekiel 24:10) 
“‘Add more wood. Let the fire burn hotter. Let the meat be cooked, seasoned, and the bones be burned.”

(Ezekiel 24:11) 
“‘Then let the empty pot be set on the hot coals, so that it becomes hot, and so that its bronze is burned away, and its rust is corrupted.”

(Ezekiel 24:12) 
“‘It has become worn out with labor, but its great rust has not left it. In the fire, its rust will be destroyed.”

(Ezekiel 24:13) 
“‘Because of the sins which you have, you are unclean. I have tried to cleanse you, but you were not cleansed. You will not be cleansed from your filth, until my wrath against you is at rest.”

(Ezekiel 24:14) 
“‘I, the Lord, have spoken. It will come to pass and I will act. I will not relent, and my eye will not pity you. I will judge you according to your ways and your deeds,’ says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 24:15) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:16) 
“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the delight of your eyes by a blow. You will not weep, nor lament, and your tears will not come.”

(Ezekiel 24:17) 
“Groan silently. Do not mourn for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet. Do not cover your mouth, nor eat the food of other men.”

(Ezekiel 24:18) 
So, I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. In the morning, I did as I was commanded.

(Ezekiel 24:19) 
Then the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean which you are doing?”

(Ezekiel 24:20) 
And I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:21) 
“‘Speak to the house of Israel: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I will pollute my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your soul. And your sons and your daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword.”

(Ezekiel 24:22) 
“‘You will do as I have done: You will not cover your mouths, nor eat the food of other men.”

(Ezekiel 24:23) 
“‘Your turbans will remain on your heads, and your shoes will remain on your feet. You will not mourn, nor weep. But you will waste away in your iniquities, and you will groan to one another.”

(Ezekiel 24:24) 
“‘Thus, Ezekiel will be a sign to you. You will do according to all that he has done. When this comes, you will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 24:25) 
“‘And you, son of man, will not you, on the day that I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the delight of their eyes, and that upon which their souls long, their sons and their daughters?

(Ezekiel 24:26) 
“‘On that day, someone will come to you, fleeing to tell you the news.”

(Ezekiel 24:27) 
“‘On that day your mouth will be opened with him who has fled, and you will speak and will no longer be silent. You will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 25:1) 
The Lord spoke a message to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 25:2) 
Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy about them.

(Ezekiel 25:3) 
And say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord God. The Lord God says this: Because you said “Aha!” in response to the destruction of my holy place, because it was profaned, and in response to the land of Israel, because it was desolate, and in response to the house of Judah, because they were led away captive,

(Ezekiel 25:4) 
therefore I will give you over to the sons of the East, to take possession, and they will set up their camps in you, and they will set up their tents in you: they will eat your fruits, and they will drink your milk.

(Ezekiel 25:5) 
And I will turn Rabbah into a stable for camels, and the Ammonites into a resting place for flocks: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:6) 
For the Lord God says this: Because you clapped your hands, and stamped your foot, and rejoiced with all the disdain against the land of Israel,

(Ezekiel 25:7) 
therefore I will stretch out my hand over you, and I will give you as plunder to the nations: and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the lands, and I will scatter you: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:8) 
The Lord God says this: Because Moab and Seir said: Behold, like all the nations, the house of Judah.

(Ezekiel 25:9) 
Therefore I will open the side of Moab from its borders, from its cities, from its borders, and its glory, and its strongest ones: and from the sons of Ammon.

(Ezekiel 25:10) 
I will give it with the sons of Ammon as a possession, so that they will not be remembered among the nations: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:11) 
For the Lord God says this: Because Edom took revenge against the house of Judah, and offended it, and took revenge.

(Ezekiel 25:12) 
Therefore the Lord God says this: I will stretch out my hand over Edom, and I will cut off from it man and beast, and I will make it a desolation, from Teman even to Dedan: by the sword they will fall.

(Ezekiel 25:13) 
And I will take my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they will act in Edom according to my wrath, and my fury: and they will know my vengeance, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 25:14) 
The Lord God says this: Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and vengeance with a spirit of contempt, to extermination, because of eternal hatred:

(Ezekiel 25:15) 
therefore the Lord God says this: Behold, I will stretch out my hand over the Philistines, and I will destroy the remnant of the Cretans, and the rest of the sea.

(Ezekiel 25:16) 
And I will take great vengeance on them by means of reproaches of fury: and they will know that I am the Lord, when I shall have taken my vengeance on them.

(Ezekiel 26:1) 
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:2) 
Son of man, because Tyre said of Jerusalem: “Aha! The gates of the nations are broken; she is turned over to me; I will be filled, now that she is laid waste:”

(Ezekiel 26:3) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.

(Ezekiel 26:4) 
They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her soil from her and make her like a bare rock.

(Ezekiel 26:5) 
She will become a place for spreading nets in the sea, and for the merchants of the nations; for I have spoken,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 26:6) 
Thus says the Lord God: “Because you have said: ‘I am perfect in beauty,’ therefore, behold, I will bring strangers against you.

(Ezekiel 26:7) 
They will unsheathe their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will defile your splendor.

(Ezekiel 26:8) 
They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.

(Ezekiel 26:9) 
Will you then say, ‘I am God,’ in the presence of your killers? You are a man, and not God, in the hands of those who slay you.

(Ezekiel 26:10) 
You will die the death of the uncircumcised, by the hand of strangers, for I have spoken,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 26:11) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:12) 
Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre.

(Ezekiel 26:13) 
And say to him: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

(Ezekiel 26:14) 
You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: sardius, topaz, and diamond, chrysolite, onyx, and beryl, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald; and gold was the work of your settings and your sockets. On the day that you were created they were prepared.

(Ezekiel 26:15) 
You were an anointed cherub who covers, and I placed you on the holy mountain of God; you were in the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 26:16) 
You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, until iniquity was found in you.

(Ezekiel 26:17) 
In the abundance of your trade, your heart was filled with violence, and you sinned; therefore, I cast you out of the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 26:18) 
Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I laid you before kings, that they might gaze at you.

(Ezekiel 26:19) 
By the multitude of your iniquities, in the iniquity of your trade you have profaned your sanctuaries; therefore I have brought fire out from your midst; it has devoured you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who see you.

(Ezekiel 26:20) 
All who knew you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have become a terror, and shall be no more forever.”

(Ezekiel 26:21) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:22) 
Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her.

(Ezekiel 26:23) 
And say, “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I execute judgments in her, and I am sanctified in her.

(Ezekiel 26:24) 
For I will send a plague upon her, and blood in her streets; and the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword against her on every side. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 26:25) 
And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from any who are around them and who have treated them with contempt. Then they shall know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 26:26) 
Thus says the Lord God: ‘When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and I am sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 26:27) 
And they will dwell securely in it, and they will build houses and plant vineyards, and they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. Then they shall know that I am the Lord their God.’

(Ezekiel 27:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 27:2) 
“Son of man, sing a lamentation over Tyre,

(Ezekiel 27:3) 
and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, who trades with the peoples on the islands, ‘The Lord God says this: “O Tyre, you said: ‘I am perfect in beauty.’”

(Ezekiel 27:4) 
“In the heart of the seas are your boundaries. Those who built you perfected your beauty.

(Ezekiel 27:5) 
“They made all your planks from the fir trees of Sharon. They took cedars from Lebanon to make the mast for you.

(Ezekiel 27:6) 
“They made your oars from the oak of Bashan, and your house from ivory, which they brought from the islands of the Kittim.

(Ezekiel 27:7) 
“Fine linen from Egypt was your sail, that it might be as a banner to you. Hyacinth and purple from the islands of Elisha were your covering.

(Ezekiel 27:8) 
“The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men, O Tyre, were in you, your pilots.

(Ezekiel 27:9) 
“The elders of Gebal and its wise men repaired your gaps. All the ships of the sea and its sailors were in you, in your trading.

(Ezekiel 27:10) 
“Persians and Lydians, and Libyans were in your army. Your men in battle hung up their shield and helmet. They displayed your glory.

(Ezekiel 27:11) 
“The sons of Arvad and all your army were on your walls all around, and your towers were with their arms. Your shields hung on your walls all around. They perfected your beauty.

(Ezekiel 27:12) 
“Tarshish was your merchant in the multitude of all riches, in silver, iron, tin, lead, they traded in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:13) 
“Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants. They traded the souls of men and bronze vessels in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:14) 
“From the house of Togarmah they brought horses and horsemen and mules in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:15) 
“The sons of Dedan were your merchants. Many islands were your merchants. They paid you ivory tusks and ebony.

(Ezekiel 27:16) 
“Syria was your merchant in the multitude of your works, in gems, and purple, and in various colors, and in fine linen, and in silk, and in chrysolite in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:17) 
“Judah and the land of Israel were your merchants. They offered your merchandise of the first wheat, and in honey, and in oil, and balsam in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:18) 
“Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of your works, in the multitude of riches, in the wine of Damascus, and in white wool.

(Ezekiel 27:19) 
“Dan, and Greece, and Uzal, were in your markets. Wrought iron, and cassia, and calamus, were in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:20) 
“Dedan was your merchant in horse cloths for chariots.

(Ezekiel 27:21) 
“Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were your merchants, in lambs, and rams, and in goats, they were your merchants.

(Ezekiel 27:22) 
“The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were your merchants. In all the best spices, and in all precious stones, and in gold, they offered them in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:23) 
“Haran, and Kenah, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.

(Ezekiel 27:24) 
“These were your merchants in diverse clothes, in hyacinth and in silk, and in chrysolite, and in purple, and in tapestries, and in a chest, and in the best vessels, they traded against you.

(Ezekiel 27:25) 
“The ships of the sea traded with you in your meditation. And you are filled in your parts, and you are greatly glorified in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 27:26) 
“Your rowers brought you into the many waters. The south wind broke you in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 27:27) 
“Your riches and your treasures, and your markets, your sailors and your pilots, those who repair your gaps, and those who traded in your trading: all the men of war who are in you, with your entire assembly, will fall into the middle of the sea on the day of your ruin.

(Ezekiel 27:28) 
“At the sound of the cry of your rowers, the shepherds trembled.

(Ezekiel 27:29) 
“And all those who held the oars will come down from the ships. The sailors and all the pilots of the sea will stand over you.

(Ezekiel 27:30) 
“And they will weep over you with a great voice, and they will wail, and they will throw dust on their heads, and will be sprinkled with ashes.

(Ezekiel 27:31) 
“And they will make themselves bald because of you, and they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and they will weep for you in the bitterness of their soul, a bitter lamentation.

(Ezekiel 27:32) 
“And they will take up a lamentation over you, and weep for you, saying: ‘Who is like Tyre, which was silent in the middle of the sea?

(Ezekiel 27:33) 
“When your merchandise went out from the sea, you satisfied many peoples. In the multitude of your riches and your trading, you enriched all the kings of the earth.

(Ezekiel 27:34) 
“Now you are broken by the sea in the depths of the waters. Your merchandise and all your multitude have fallen in your midst.

(Ezekiel 27:35) 
“All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished over you, and their kings were troubled and were greatly saddened in their faces.

(Ezekiel 27:36) 
“The merchants of the peoples will hiss over you, and you will be a terror, and you will no longer be forever.”

(Ezekiel 28:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:2) 
“Son of man, speak to the prince of Tyre: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “Because your heart has become proud, and you have said: “I am a god; I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the sea,” although you are a man and not God, and you have given your heart as if it were the heart of God.”’

(Ezekiel 28:3) 
“Behold, you are wise, and nothing can be hidden from you.

(Ezekiel 28:4) 
“By your wisdom and your prudence you have made strength for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver in your treasures.

(Ezekiel 28:5) 
“By the abundance of your wisdom, and in your commerce, you have multiplied your strength: and your heart has been lifted up in your strength.

(Ezekiel 28:6) 
“Therefore, these are the words of the Lord God: ‘Because your heart has been lifted up as the heart of God,

(Ezekiel 28:7) 
“therefore, behold, I will bring against you strangers, the most powerful of the nations: and they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and will defile your glory.

(Ezekiel 28:8) 
“They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die in the death of the wounded in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 28:9) 
“Will you say, ‘I am a god,’ before your killers, when you are a man and not God, in the hand of those who kill you?

(Ezekiel 28:10) 
“You will die the death of the uncircumcised in the hand of strangers, because I have spoken, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 28:11) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:12) 
“Son of man, take up a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

(Ezekiel 28:13) 
“You were in the delights of the paradise of God: every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, and onyx, and beryl, sapphire, and carbuncle, and emerald: gold, the work of your beauty, and your openings, were prepared in the day that you were created.

(Ezekiel 28:14) 
“You were a cherub with extended wings, protecting, and I placed you on the holy mountain of God: you were in the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 28:15) 
“You were perfect in your ways from the day of your creation, until iniquity was found in you.

(Ezekiel 28:16) 
“By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with iniquity, and you sinned: and I will cast you out from the mountain of God, and will destroy you, cherub, protecting, from the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 28:17) 
“And your heart was lifted up in your beauty, you have destroyed your wisdom in your splendor: I cast you to the earth, I placed you before the face of kings, that they may see you.

(Ezekiel 28:18) 
“By the multitude of your iniquity, and in your commerce, you have defiled your holy places: and I will bring fire from the midst of you, which will consume you, and I will give you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all those who see you.

(Ezekiel 28:19) 
“All those who see you among the nations are astonished at you: you have become a terror, and you will be no more.”

(Ezekiel 28:20) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:21) 
“Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it,

(Ezekiel 28:22) 
“and say: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst: and they will know that I am the Lord, when I have executed judgments in it, and have been sanctified in it.

(Ezekiel 28:23) 
“And I will send a pestilence upon it, and blood in its streets: and the slain will fall in the midst of it by the sword that is against it: and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 28:24) 
“And the house of Israel will no longer have a piercing thorn, nor a painful thorn, from all those who are around it, who have despised it: and they will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 28:25) 
“These are the words of the Lord God: ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations: and they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 28:26) 
“And they will live there securely, and they will build houses, and plant vineyards: and they will live confidently, when I have executed judgment on all those who oppress them around them: and they will know that I am the Lord their God.”

(Ezekiel 29:1) 
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Son spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 29:2) 
Son of man, turn your face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 29:3) 
Speak and say: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon who lies in the middle of your streams, who says: “The Nile is mine, and I made myself.”'

(Ezekiel 29:4) 
And I will put a bit in your jaws, and I will bind the fish of your streams to your scales, and I will bring you out of the middle of your streams, and all the fish of your streams I will bind to your scales.

(Ezekiel 29:5) 
And I will cast you into the desert, and all the fish of your streams: you will fall on the face of the field, you will not be gathered, nor will you be collected: I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky.

(Ezekiel 29:6) 
And all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord, because you were a broken reed to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 29:7) 
When they took hold of you with the hand, you were broken, and you loosened all their loins: and when they leaned on you, you were broken, and you loosened all their backs.

(Ezekiel 29:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and I will kill man and beast from you.

(Ezekiel 29:9) 
And the land of Egypt will be a desert, and a wasteland: and they will know that I am the Lord, because you said: “The Nile is mine, and I made myself.”

(Ezekiel 29:10) 
Therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt deserts, a wasteland, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 29:11) 
The foot of man will not pass through it, and the foot of the beast will not tread it, nor will it be inhabited for forty years.

(Ezekiel 29:12) 
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the desolate lands, and her cities desolate in the midst of the desolate cities, for forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will disperse them through the countries.

(Ezekiel 29:13) 
For thus says the Lord God: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.

(Ezekiel 29:14) 
And I will bring back the Egyptians, and I will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin: and there they will be a small kingdom.

(Ezekiel 29:15) 
And it will be small among the kingdoms, and it will not be exalted any more above the nations: and I will not add that they should rule over the nations.

(Ezekiel 29:16) 
And there will no longer be hope for the house of Israel, remembering their iniquity, when they have turned after them: and they will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 29:17) 
In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Son spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 29:18) 
Son of man, the Chaldeans have taken captives from Tyre and Sidon: because they handed Egypt over to the power of the nations: and I have given it into their hand.

(Ezekiel 29:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon: and he will take away its multitude, and will plunder its spoils, and will take its plunder: and it will be the reward of his army.

(Ezekiel 29:20) 
I have given him a reward for the work he has done in the land of Egypt: because they labored for me, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 29:21) 
“On that day I will make the horn of the house of Israel sprout, and I will give you a mouth among them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 30:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 30:2) 
Son of man, prophesy and say: "These are the words of the Lord God: Howl, 'Woe, the day!' Woe, the day!"

(Ezekiel 30:3) 
Because the day is near. The day of the Lord is near: a day of darkness, of clouds, and of thick gloom. The day will be on the land, and the trumpet will be sounded there.

(Ezekiel 30:4) 
I will bring about chaos in Egypt, and there will be pain in Ethiopia, and those who are strong will enter Egypt. Its foundations will be destroyed.

(Ezekiel 30:5) 
The Ethiopians, and the Libyans, and the Lydians, and every mixed crowd, and Chub, and the sons of the land that is in league, they will fall with the sword.

(Ezekiel 30:6) 
These are the words of the Lord: "Those who support Egypt will fall, and the pride of its strength will be humbled. The sword will fall on them, from the tower of Syene," says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 30:7) 
I will make the land of Egypt desolate, and I will bring about solitude there, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 30:8) 
The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have put fire in Egypt, and all its helpers have been destroyed.

(Ezekiel 30:9) 
In that day, messengers will go out from my presence in ships, to destroy confident Ethiopia, and there will be terror among them, as in the day of Egypt, because, behold, it comes.

(Ezekiel 30:10) 
These are the words of the Lord God: "I will destroy the multitude of Egypt, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

(Ezekiel 30:11) 
He and his people with him, who are the strongest of the nations, will be for the destruction of the land: they will draw their swords against Egypt, and they will fill the land with the slain.

(Ezekiel 30:12) 
I will dry up the rivers, and I will hand the land over to the hand of the wicked, and I will desolate the land and its fullness, by the hand of foreigners: I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 30:13) 
These are the words of the Lord God: "I will destroy the idols, and I will break the images of Memphis: there will be no prince from the land of Egypt, and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:14) 
I will desolate Pathros, and I will put fire in Taphnis, and I will bring about judgments in Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:15) 
I will pour out my indignation on Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I will destroy the multitude of Alexandria.

(Ezekiel 30:16) 
I will put fire in Egypt: Sin will be troubled, Alexandria will be troubled, and Memphis will be brought into distress during the day.

(Ezekiel 30:17) 
The young men of Aven and Phibeseth will fall by the sword, and they will be led into captivity.

(Ezekiel 30:18) 
In Taphnis, the day will also be darkened, when I break the scepters of Egypt there, and the pride of its strength will cease in it. A cloud will cover it, and its daughters will be led into captivity.

(Ezekiel 30:19) 
I will bring about judgments in Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 30:20) 
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 30:21) 
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt: and behold, it is not bound up so that it may be put in cloths to heal it, nor tied, that it might have strength to carry the sword.

(Ezekiel 30:22) 
Therefore, these are the words of the Lord God: "Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, both the strong ones and the broken ones: and I will cast the sword from his hand.

(Ezekiel 30:23) 
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will scatter them throughout the lands.

(Ezekiel 30:24) 
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will put my sword in his hand, and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and the groans of the slain will groan before him.

(Ezekiel 30:25) 
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall, and they will know that I am the Lord, when I put my sword in the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out over the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:26) 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will scatter them throughout the lands, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 31:1) 
In the eleventh year, in the third month, the word of the Lord came to me saying:

(Ezekiel 31:2) 
Son of man, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his people: “To whom are you like, in your glory and greatness?”

(Ezekiel 31:3) 
Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in its branches, its foliage gave shade, it was tall, and its top was in the clouds.

(Ezekiel 31:4) 
Water nourished it, the deep lifted it up; its rivers flowed around its planting, and it sent out its streams to all the trees.

(Ezekiel 31:5) 
Therefore its top was raised above all the trees of the region, and its branches multiplied, and its arms extended into the many waters, when it sent out its height.

(Ezekiel 31:6) 
In its branches nested all the birds of the sky, and under its branches made their nests all the beasts of the earth, and under its shadow dwelt many nations.

(Ezekiel 31:7) 
And it became beautiful in its greatness and in the length of its branches, because its root was near many waters.

(Ezekiel 31:8) 
The cedars were not higher than it in the paradise of God; the fir trees did not equal its branches, and the plane trees were not like its leaves; no tree in the paradise of God was like it in its beauty.

(Ezekiel 31:9) 
I made it beautiful in the multitude of its branches, and all the trees of pleasure that were in the paradise of God envied it.

(Ezekiel 31:10) 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because it was exalted in height, and its top gave itself to the clouds, and its heart was lifted up in its height,

(Ezekiel 31:11) 
I delivered it into the hand of the most powerful of the nations: he will deal with it; I have done to it according to its wickedness.

(Ezekiel 31:12) 
And strangers from the nations threw it down, and I cast it on the mountains, and its branches fell in the valleys, and its arms were broken by all the rivers of the earth, and all the peoples left its shadow and abandoned it.

(Ezekiel 31:13) 
On its ruin will dwell all the birds of the sky, and in its branches will be all the beasts of the earth:

(Ezekiel 31:14) 
so that no tree of the waters will exalt itself in its height, nor set its top in the clouds, when all the trees of the waters are delivered to death in the lower earth, in the midst of the children of men who go down to the pit.

(Ezekiel 31:15) 
Thus says the Lord God: On the day that it went down to hell, I mourned; I covered it with the abyss and restrained its rivers and held back the many waters: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field were broken over it.

(Ezekiel 31:16) 
I heard the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to hell; and because of it trembled all the trees of pleasure that were in Lebanon, and all who were nourished on the earth.

(Ezekiel 31:17) 
They also went down with it to hell, to those who had been killed by the sword, and its arm, which dwelt under its shadow in the midst of the nations.

(Ezekiel 31:18) 
To whom are you like in glory and greatness among the trees of pleasure? Now you will be led down with the trees of pleasure to the lower earth: in the midst of the uncircumcised, you will sleep with those killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 32:2) 
Son of man, make a lament for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him: The lion of the nations is destroyed.

(Ezekiel 32:3) 
Like a dragon in the waters, you were crushing nations: you went out with your rivers, and you stirred up the waters with your feet, and you trampled their streams.

(Ezekiel 32:4) 
Thus says the Lord God: I will spread out my net over you with a multitude of peoples, and I will bring you into my snares.

(Ezekiel 32:5) 
And I will cast you upon the land, and I will cast you upon the face of the field: and I will make all the birds of the sky dwell upon you, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with you.

(Ezekiel 32:6) 
And I will give your flesh upon the mountains, and I will fill the valleys with your height.

(Ezekiel 32:7) 
And I will dry up the land, when you are extinguished, and I will cover the skies, and I will darken its stars: I will veil the sun with clouds, and the moon will not give its light.

(Ezekiel 32:8) 
I will make dark all the lights of the sky's splendor over you, and I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:9) 
And I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.

(Ezekiel 32:10) 
And I will make the nations desolate over you, and their kings will shudder over you, when I brandish my sword before their faces: and they will tremble in an instant, each one for his own soul, on the day of your ruin.

(Ezekiel 32:11) 
For thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.

(Ezekiel 32:12) 
I will cast you down by the hands of the mighty, the terror of the nations: and I will set you upon the high mountains, and your hearts will perish, and you will die in the midst of the sea.

(Ezekiel 32:13) 
And I will make all its beasts cease, and I will destroy all its cattle upon the many waters: the foot of man will no longer disturb them, nor will the hoof of cattle trample them.

(Ezekiel 32:14) 
Then I will make their waters clear, and I will cause their rivers to flow like oil, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:15) 
When I have made the land of Egypt desolate, and have left the land from its fullness, when I strike all those who dwell in it: then you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 32:16) 
This is the lamentation, and the daughters of the nations will weep for it: for Egypt and for all its multitude: for the daughters of the nations.

(Ezekiel 32:17) 
Now it happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, that the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 32:18) 
Son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt, and cast it down, you and the daughters of the famous nations, into the deepest parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:19) 
Whom do you surpass in beauty? When you go down, you will sleep with the uncircumcised.

(Ezekiel 32:20) 
They will fall in the midst of those slain by the sword: the sword has been given, they are laid waste, with all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 32:21) 
The mighty will speak to him from among the mighty, from the midst of the underworld: they have gone down, they have slept uncircumcised, who were slain by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:22) 
Assyria is there, and all its company: around his tomb all those slain, and those who have fallen by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:23) 
Whose tomb they have placed in the depths of the pit, and his company around his tomb: all the slain, and those who have fallen by the sword, who have given terror in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:24) 
There is Elam, and all its multitude around his tomb: all those slain, and those who have fallen by the sword: who have gone down uncircumcised into the depths of the earth, who have given terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who have gone down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:25) 
They have given a bed among those slain with all its multitude: around his tomb, all the uncircumcised: because they have given terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who have gone down into the pit: in the midst of the slain.

(Ezekiel 32:26) 
There is Meshech, Tubal, and all its multitude: around him is his tomb, all the uncircumcised, who were slain by the sword: for they thought themselves wicked in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:27) 
And they did not sleep with the mighty, who have fallen from the nations, who have gone down into hell with their weapons, and have placed their swords under their heads: and their iniquities were upon their bones, because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:28) 
But you, in the midst of the uncircumcised, will be broken, and you will sleep with those slain by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:29) 
There are the leaders, and all their multitude: around their tomb, all the uncircumcised, who have fallen by the sword, with those who have given terror in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:30) 
There are the princes of the north, everyone, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, terrified, and confused in their strength: and they have placed their shame with those who have gone down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:31) 
Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude: Pharaoh, and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:32) 
For I have given my terror in the land of the living, and he will sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised: with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 33:1) 
The Lord's Word came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 33:2) 
“Son of man, speak to the people and say to them: 'If I bring a sword to the land, and the people of the land take a man, and make him their watchman',

(Ezekiel 33:3) 
“If the watchman sees the sword coming to the land, and blows the trumpet, and warns the people,”

(Ezekiel 33:4) 
“If the one who hears the sound of the trumpet, does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away: his blood will be on his own head.”

(Ezekiel 33:5) 
“He heard the sound of the trumpet, but he didn’t take warning: his blood will be on him. If he takes warning, he will save his life.”

(Ezekiel 33:6) 
“But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet, and the people do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes away any of them, the watchman is the cause of his own death, and I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.”

(Ezekiel 33:7) 
“So you, son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. You will hear the word from my mouth, and you shall warn them from me.”

(Ezekiel 33:8) 
“If I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you shall surely die', and you do not speak to warn the wicked man to turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 33:9) 
“If you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.”

(Ezekiel 33:10) 
“Therefore, son of man, tell the house of Israel, 'You are saying, “Our sins and our iniquities are upon us, and we waste away because of them. How then can we live?”'

(Ezekiel 33:11) 
“Tell them, as I live, says the Lord God, I don't want the wicked to die, but that the wicked would turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways, and why will you die, O house of Israel?”

(Ezekiel 33:12) 
“You, son of man, tell the children of your people, 'The justice of the just will not deliver him in the day that he sins; and the wickedness of the wicked will not hurt him on the day that he turns from his wickedness. And the just man will not be able to live in his justice on the day that he sins.”

(Ezekiel 33:13) 
“'When I tell the just man that he will surely live, and he trusts in his justice and sins, all his acts of justice will be forgotten, and in the iniquity he committed, he will die.”

(Ezekiel 33:14) 
“And when I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die', and he does penance for his sin, and does what is lawful and right,”

(Ezekiel 33:15) 
“'if the wicked restores the pledge, and gives back what he had stolen, and walks in the commandments of life, not doing any injustice: he shall live, and not die.”

(Ezekiel 33:16) 
“None of his sins which he committed will be remembered. He did what is lawful and right, he shall live.”

(Ezekiel 33:17) 
“And the children of your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just', when it is their own way that is perverted.”

(Ezekiel 33:18) 
“When the just man turns from his justice, and does iniquity, he shall die in his iniquity.”

(Ezekiel 33:19) 
“And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does what is lawful and right, he will live in them.”

(Ezekiel 33:20) 
“And you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just', but I will judge each of you according to your ways, O house of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 33:21) 
“And in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, there came to me a man who had escaped from Jerusalem, saying: The city is taken!”

(Ezekiel 33:22) 
“And the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, before the one who had escaped came to me, and He opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning, and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer silent.”

(Ezekiel 33:23) 
“And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:”

(Ezekiel 33:24) 
“Son of man, the inhabitants of these deserts speak among themselves, saying: 'Abraham was one, and he possessed the land, but we are many; therefore the land has been given to us to possess.”

(Ezekiel 33:25) 
“So tell them, thus says the Lord God: 'Will you possess the land when you eat with blood, and lift your eyes to your idols, and have shed blood?'

(Ezekiel 33:26) 
“'You have stood by your sword, you have committed abomination, and you have defiled the wife of your neighbor, and will you possess the land?'

(Ezekiel 33:27) 
“Tell them, thus says the Lord God: 'As I live, those who are in the deserts shall fall by the sword. And whoever is in the open country, I will give them to be eaten by beasts; and those who are in the fortresses and in the caves, shall die of the plague.”

(Ezekiel 33:28) 
“I will make the land a desert, and a horror; and the pride of its power shall be confounded, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, and no one shall pass through them.”

(Ezekiel 33:29) 
“And they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desert because of all their abominations that they have done.”

(Ezekiel 33:30) 
“And you, son of man, your people are talking about you by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and they are speaking to each other, saying: 'Come and hear what is the word that is coming from the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 33:31) 
“And they come to you as the people come, and sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them, for they make it like a song of love with their mouths, but their hearts are set on greed.”

(Ezekiel 33:32) 
“And you will be like a song of love to them with a sweet voice and skill in singing, and they will hear your words, but they will not do them.”

(Ezekiel 33:33) 
“When this comes to pass, then it will come to pass, and they will know that a prophet was among them.”

(Ezekiel 34:1) 
The Lord's word came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 34:2) 
“Son of man, prophesy to the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell the shepherds, ‘Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who feed themselves! Do not the shepherds feed the sheep?

(Ezekiel 34:3) 
“You eat the milk, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed my flock.

(Ezekiel 34:4) 
“You have not strengthened the weak, nor healed the sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back the strayed, nor sought the lost; but you have ruled them with force and cruelty.

(Ezekiel 34:5) 
“My sheep were scattered, because they had no shepherd; and they became food for all the wild beasts of the field, and were scattered.

(Ezekiel 34:6) 
“My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered across the whole earth, and there was no one to seek them or look for them.

(Ezekiel 34:7) 
“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

(Ezekiel 34:8) 
“As I live, says the Lord God, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, because there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds did not seek my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and did not feed my sheep:

(Ezekiel 34:9) 
“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

(Ezekiel 34:10) 
“Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and will make them cease from feeding the flock; and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves. I will deliver my flock from their mouths, and they shall no longer be food for them.

(Ezekiel 34:11) 
“For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I, even I, will seek my sheep and will visit them.

(Ezekiel 34:12) 
“As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so I will seek out my sheep and will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.

(Ezekiel 34:13) 
“I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

(Ezekiel 34:14) 
“I will feed them in a good pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel shall their pasture be; there they shall lie down in a good grazing ground, and on fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 34:15) 
“I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 34:16) 
“I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.

(Ezekiel 34:17) 
“As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God: I will judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.

(Ezekiel 34:18) 
“Is it too small a thing for you to feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? And to drink clear water, that you must foul the rest with your feet?

(Ezekiel 34:19) 
“And must my sheep eat what your feet have trodden down, and drink what your feet have fouled?

(Ezekiel 34:20) 
“Therefore, thus says the Lord God to them: Behold, I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

(Ezekiel 34:21) 
“Because you push with side and shoulder, and you thrust with your horns all the weak ones, until you have scattered them abroad,

(Ezekiel 34:22) 
“I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

(Ezekiel 34:23) 
“And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will feed them. He will feed them and he will be their shepherd.

(Ezekiel 34:24) 
“And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the Lord have spoken.

(Ezekiel 34:25) 
“I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will rid the land of evil beasts, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.

(Ezekiel 34:26) 
“And I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. And I will send down the shower in its season, and there shall be showers of blessing.

(Ezekiel 34:27) 
“And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the land shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hand of those who enslaved them.

(Ezekiel 34:28) 
“They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.

(Ezekiel 34:29) 
“I will provide for them a planting of renown, and they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and they shall no longer bear the disgrace of the nations.

(Ezekiel 34:30) 
“And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 34:31) 
“You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 35:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 35:2) 
“Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

(Ezekiel 35:3) 
and tell it: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir! I will extend my hand against you, and I will give you to be a desolation and a solitude.

(Ezekiel 35:4) 
I will make your cities a desolation, and you will be desolate, and you will know that I am the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 35:5) 
“Because you have been an enemy forever and have handed over the children of Israel to the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of their final iniquity,

(Ezekiel 35:6) 
therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will hand you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you, because you have hated bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.

(Ezekiel 35:7) 
I will make Mount Seir a desolation and a desert, and I will take away from it those who come and go.

(Ezekiel 35:8) 
I will fill its mountains with the slain, those wounded by the sword; on your hills, in your valleys, and in your ravines they will fall.

(Ezekiel 35:9) 
I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited, and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 35:10) 
“Because you have said: ‘These two nations, and these two lands, are mine, and we will possess them,’ even though the Lord was there,

(Ezekiel 35:11) 
therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you have shown from your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.

(Ezekiel 35:12) 
Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are desolate, they have been given to us to devour.’

(Ezekiel 35:13) 
You have magnified yourselves against me in your mouth, and you have multiplied your words against me; I have heard.

(Ezekiel 35:14) 
Thus says the Lord God: When all the earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.

(Ezekiel 35:15) 
As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you; you will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Idumea, and you will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 36:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 36:2) 
Son of man, prophesy against the mountains of Israel, and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord.

(Ezekiel 36:3) 
Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha, aha! The ancient high places are ours! The inheritance of the nations is given to us.”

(Ezekiel 36:4) 
Therefore prophesy over the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I speak in my zeal and in my fury, because you have borne the reproach of the nations.

(Ezekiel 36:5) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I have lifted up my hand, because the nations that are around you will bear your reproach.

(Ezekiel 36:6) 
But you, mountains of Israel, you will shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they will soon be back.

(Ezekiel 36:7) 
For behold, I am with you, and I will turn to you: and you will be cultivated and sown in the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 36:8) 
And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, and the cities will be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt.

(Ezekiel 36:9) 
And I will multiply men upon you and beasts: and they will increase and grow: and I will cause you to dwell as in the days of old, and better than at the beginning: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 36:10) 
And I will bring upon you men, my people Israel: and they will possess you, and you will be an inheritance for them: and you will not again make them barren.

(Ezekiel 36:11) 
Thus says the Lord God: Because they say of you, 'You are a devourer of men, and have been the cause of the loss of your nation.'

(Ezekiel 36:12) 
Therefore you will no longer devour men, nor will you cause your nation to perish, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 36:13) 
And you will no longer hear the reproach of the nations, nor will you bear the insults of your people any longer: and you will not cause the nations to lose their people any longer, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 36:14) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 36:15) 
Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, and defiled it in their way and in their studies: according to the impurity of the menstruating woman their way was before me.

(Ezekiel 36:16) 
And I poured out my indignation upon them, because of the blood they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.

(Ezekiel 36:17) 
And I scattered them among the nations, and they were scattered over the regions: according to their way and their studies I judged them.

(Ezekiel 36:18) 
And they went to the nations to which they had come, and profaned my holy name, when they said of them: 'This is the people of the Lord, and they have come out of his land.'

(Ezekiel 36:19) 
And I spared my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they had come.

(Ezekiel 36:20) 
Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you have come.

(Ezekiel 36:21) 
And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the nations may know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when I am sanctified in you before their eyes.

(Ezekiel 36:22) 
And I will take you from among the nations, and I will gather you from all the lands, and I will bring you into your own land.

(Ezekiel 36:23) 
And I will pour clean water upon you, and you will be cleansed from all your impurities, and I will cleanse you from all your idols.

(Ezekiel 36:24) 
And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in your midst: and I will take away the stony heart from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

(Ezekiel 36:25) 
And I will put my spirit in your midst: and I will cause you to walk in my precepts, and to keep my judgments, and to perform them.

(Ezekiel 36:26) 
And you will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers: and you will be my people, and I will be your God.

(Ezekiel 36:27) 
And I will save you from all your impurities: and I will call for the grain, and I will multiply it, and I will not bring famine upon you.

(Ezekiel 36:28) 
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, and you will no longer bear the reproach of the nations because of famine.

(Ezekiel 36:29) 
And you will remember your evil ways, and your studies that were not good: and your iniquities and your crimes will displease you.

(Ezekiel 36:30) 
I do not do this for your sake, says the Lord God, let it be known to you: be ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 36:31) 
Thus says the Lord God: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, and make the cities to be inhabited, and rebuild the ruins,

(Ezekiel 36:32) 
and the desolate land will be cultivated, that was desolate before the eyes of everyone who passed by:

(Ezekiel 36:33) 
and they will say: That land that was desolate has become like the garden of paradise, and the cities that were deserted, and desolate, and destroyed, are fortified.

(Ezekiel 36:34) 
And the nations that are left around you will know that I the Lord have built the ruins, and I have planted what was desolate: I the Lord have spoken and done it.

(Ezekiel 36:35) 
Thus says the Lord God: I will still be inquired of by the house of Israel, that I may do this for them: I will multiply them like a flock of men.

(Ezekiel 36:36) 
As the holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts, so will the desolate cities be, and they will be inhabited: and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 37:1) 
The hand of the Lord came over me, and He took me in the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a plain, which was full of bones.

(Ezekiel 37:2) 
And He led me all around among them. The bones were scattered everywhere on the surface of the plain, and they were very dry.

(Ezekiel 37:3) 
And He said to me, “Son of man, do you think these bones can live again?”

(Ezekiel 37:4) 
I said: “Lord God, only You know.”

(Ezekiel 37:5) 
And He said to me: “Prophesy to these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 37:6) 
“‘This is what the Lord God says to these bones: “Behold, I will send the breath of life into you, and you will live again.

(Ezekiel 37:7) 
“‘I will put sinews on you, and cause flesh to grow over you, and I will put skin on you, and I will give you My Spirit, and you will live again, and you will know that I am the Lord.”'

(Ezekiel 37:8) 
I prophesied as He commanded me, and suddenly, there was a noise and a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to bone.

(Ezekiel 37:9) 
I saw that the sinews and flesh came upon them, and skin covered them, but there was no life in them.

(Ezekiel 37:10) 
Then He said to me: “Prophesy to the Spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the Spirit: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.’

(Ezekiel 37:11) 
So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath of life came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet—a very, very great army.

(Ezekiel 37:12) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say: ‘Our bones are dry, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.’

(Ezekiel 37:13) 
Therefore prophesy, and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I will open your graves, and I will bring you up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.’

(Ezekiel 37:14) 
“‘Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up out of your graves, O My people.

(Ezekiel 37:15) 
“‘I will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it,’ says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 37:16) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 37:17) 
“Son of man, take one piece of wood and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the children of Israel associated with him.’ Then take another piece of wood and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the wood of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel associated with him.’

(Ezekiel 37:18) 
Then join them together into one piece of wood, so that they become one in your hand.

(Ezekiel 37:19) 
“And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean?’”

(Ezekiel 37:20) 
say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will give them to the wood of Judah, and I will make them one wood, and they will be one in My hand.”

(Ezekiel 37:21) 
“‘The woods on which you have written will be in their hand before their eyes.

(Ezekiel 37:22) 
“‘And say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land.

(Ezekiel 37:23) 
“‘I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be ruler over all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they ever again be divided into two kingdoms.

(Ezekiel 37:24) 
“‘They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their abominations, or with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God.

(Ezekiel 37:25) 
“‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My judgments and keep My commandments and do them.

(Ezekiel 37:26) 
“‘They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived; and they will live in it, they and their sons and their grandsons, forever; and My servant David will be their prince forever.

(Ezekiel 37:27) 
“‘I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will plant them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.

(Ezekiel 37:28) 
“‘My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.

(Ezekiel 37:29) 
“‘And the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.’”

(Ezekiel 38:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 38:2) 
“Son of man, turn your face toward Gog in the land of Magog, the leader of the tribes of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

(Ezekiel 38:3) 
and say: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Gog, leader of the tribes of Meshech and Tubal.

(Ezekiel 38:4) 
I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws, and I will bring you out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them fully armed, a great company with shields and bucklers, all of them bearing swords.

(Ezekiel 38:5) 
Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shields and helmets.

(Ezekiel 38:6) 
Gomer and all his troops; Beth-Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many peoples are with you.

(Ezekiel 38:7) 
Be prepared and prepare yourself, you and all your hosts that are gathered about you, and be a guard for them.

(Ezekiel 38:8) 
After many days, you shall be visited. In the latter years, you will come into the land that has been restored from the sword, gathered from many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a perpetual waste. This people has been brought out of the peoples, and they will dwell in it all.

(Ezekiel 38:9) 
And you shall ascend, and come like a storm, and like a cloud, to cover the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.

(Ezekiel 38:10) 
Thus says the Lord God: On that day, thoughts will arise in your heart, and you will devise an evil plan.

(Ezekiel 38:11) 
And you will say: ‘I will go up to the land without walls; I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and who have no bars or gates.

(Ezekiel 38:12) 
To take spoils and seize plunder, to lay your hand on those who have been gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth.’

(Ezekiel 38:13) 
Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its young lions will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoils? Have you assembled your company to take plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, and to seize great spoils?’

(Ezekiel 38:14) 
Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: ‘Thus says the Lord God: On that day when My people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it?

(Ezekiel 38:15) 
And you will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them mounted on horses, a great company and a mighty army.

(Ezekiel 38:16) 
You will come up against My people Israel, like a cloud to cover the land. In the last days, it will be, and I will bring you against My land, when I am hallowed in you, O Gog, before the eyes of the nations.

(Ezekiel 38:17) 
Thus says the Lord God: Are you he of whom I spoke in the days of old by the hand of My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days that I would bring you against them?

(Ezekiel 38:18) 
And it will be on that day, in the days when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord God, My wrath will arise in My fury.

(Ezekiel 38:19) 
For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath, I have spoken: Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 38:20) 
The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the people who are on the face of the earth will tremble at My presence. The mountains will be thrown down, and the cliffs will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground.

(Ezekiel 38:21) 
And I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains, says the Lord God. Every man’s sword will be against his brother.

(Ezekiel 38:22) 
And I will enter into judgment with him by pestilence and by blood; and I will rain on him and his troops and on the many peoples who are with him, a torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

(Ezekiel 38:23) 
I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations. And they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 39:1) 
And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and you will say: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am coming against you, Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.’

(Ezekiel 39:2) 
And I will turn you around, and I will drive you, and I will bring you from the sides of the north, and I will bring you onto the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 39:3) 
And I will strike your bow in your left hand, and I will break your arrows in your right hand.

(Ezekiel 39:4) 
On the mountains of Israel you will fall, and all your hosts, and the peoples who are with you: I will give you to the birds of prey of every kind, and to the beasts of the field, to be devoured.

(Ezekiel 39:5) 
You will fall on the face of the field: because I have spoken, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:6) 
And I will send fire on Magog, and on those who dwell in the isles, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 39:7) 
And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not pollute my holy name any further: and the nations will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.

(Ezekiel 39:8) 
Behold, it is coming, and it is done, says the Lord God: this is the day about which I have spoken.

(Ezekiel 39:9) 
And the inhabitants will go out from the cities of Israel, and they will burn and set on fire the weapons, and the shields, and the spears, the bows and arrows, and the clubs, and all the equipment: and they will burn them with fire for seven years.

(Ezekiel 39:10) 
And they will not carry wood from the region, nor will they cut from the forests: because with the weapons they will set fire, and they will plunder those who plundered them, and they will despoil those who despoiled them, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:11) 
And it will be in that day, I will give Gog a place named a sepulcher in Israel, the valley of those traveling east of the sea, and it will strike it, and it will obstruct the way of those passing through: and they will bury there Gog, and all his multitude, and it will be called the valley of the multitude of Gog.

(Ezekiel 39:12) 
And the house of Israel will bury them, to cleanse the land, for seven months.

(Ezekiel 39:13) 
And all the people of the land will bury, and it will be to them a name: in the day when I will be glorified, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:14) 
And they will separate men who do not cease to pass through the land, and they will bury those who remain, to cleanse it: after seven months.

(Ezekiel 39:15) 
And those who pass through the land will pass through, and when they see a bone of a man, they will build a sign near it, until they cleanse the land.

(Ezekiel 39:16) 
And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God: Say to the birds and all the birds, and all the beasts of the field: Gather together, and come, assemble from all sides to my sacrifice, which I am sacrificing for you a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat the flesh, and drink the blood.

(Ezekiel 39:17) 
You will eat the flesh of the strong, and you will drink the blood of the princes of the earth: rams, lambs, and goats, and bulls, all the fat ones of Bashan.

(Ezekiel 39:18) 
And you will eat fatness until you are satisfied, and you will drink blood until you are drunk from my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you.

(Ezekiel 39:19) 
And you will be filled at my table, horse and chariot, and the strong, and all the men of war, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:20) 
And I will give my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see my judgment which I have made, and my hand which I have put upon them.

(Ezekiel 39:21) 
And the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God, from that day and onwards.

(Ezekiel 39:22) 
And the nations will know that in their iniquity the house of Israel was led, because they forsook me, and I hid my face from them, and I delivered them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

(Ezekiel 39:23) 
According to their impurities, and their iniquities I have done to them, and I hid my face from them.

(Ezekiel 39:24) 
Thus says the Lord God: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy on all the house of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name.

(Ezekiel 39:25) 
And they will bear their shame, and all the transgression with which they transgressed against me, when they will dwell securely in their land, and there will be no one to frighten them.

(Ezekiel 39:26) 
When I will bring them back from the peoples, and I will gather them from the lands of their enemies, and I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations.

(Ezekiel 39:27) 
And they will know that I am the Lord their God, who led them into captivity among the nations: and I have not left anyone of them in their land.

(Ezekiel 39:28) 
And I will no longer hide my face from them, because I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 40:1) 
In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been struck down, on that very day, the hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me there.

(Ezekiel 40:2) 
In visions of God, He brought me to the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain; on it was the structure of a city, to the south.

(Ezekiel 40:3) 
He brought me there, and behold, a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. He stood at the gate.

(Ezekiel 40:4) 
And the man spoke to me: “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and pay attention to all that I show you, for you have been brought here so that I may show you everything that you see. Announce it to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 40:5) 
And behold, the outer wall was around the house, and in the man's hand was a measuring reed, six cubits long, by the cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the width of the structure, one reed, and the height, one reed.

(Ezekiel 40:6) 
Then he came to the gate which faced east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide, and the threshold of the other, one reed wide.

(Ezekiel 40:7) 
He measured one chamber, one reed long, and one reed wide. Between the chambers was a space of five cubits, and the threshold of the gate by the front of the vestibule of the gate inside.

(Ezekiel 40:8) 
He measured the vestibule of the gate inside, one reed.

(Ezekiel 40:9) 
He measured the vestibule of the gate, eight cubits; and its jambs were two cubits, and its pillars, two cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:10) 
In the chambers of the east gate, there were three on one side and three on the other, the same measure for the three, and the same measure for the three. The pillars of one measure on this side and on that side.

(Ezekiel 40:11) 
He measured the width of the doorway of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:12) 
And there was a barrier before each chamber, one cubit; and a chamber, one cubit; and a threshold, one cubit, next to the interior. He measured one cubit, and one cubit.

(Ezekiel 40:13) 
He measured the gate from the roof of the chambers, twenty cubits; and there were three on each side of the chamber.

(Ezekiel 40:14) 
Then he measured the pillars, sixty cubits; and beside the pillars was the court, all around the gate.

(Ezekiel 40:15) 
From the front of the gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate was sixty cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:16) 
And there were windows in its chambers, and in its pillars inside all around, and similarly in the vestibules, windows all around inside; and on the pillars were palm trees, and the measure was six cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:17) 
Then he brought me to the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement of stone, laid in the court all around. There were thirty chambers on the pavement.

(Ezekiel 40:18) 
The pavement was alongside the sides of the gates, according to the length of the gates. This is the pavement.

(Ezekiel 40:19) 
Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court, one hundred cubits. And the inner court was on the east side.

(Ezekiel 40:20) 
Then he measured the gate of the outer court that faced north. He measured its length and its width.

(Ezekiel 40:21) 
Its chambers were three on each side, and its pillars and its jambs were according to the measure of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:22) 
Its windows, its vestibules, and its palm trees were according to the measure of the gate that faced east. They went up to it by seven steps, and its vestibule was before them.

(Ezekiel 40:23) 
And the gate of the inner court was opposite the north gate and the east gate. He measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:24) 
Then he brought me to the south way, and behold, the south gate. He measured its jambs and its pillars according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:25) 
And there were windows around it on both jambs, and the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:26) 
And there were seven steps by which they ascended to it, and its jambs were before them, and palm trees on its pillars on this side and on that side.

(Ezekiel 40:27) 
And there was a gate of the inner court on the south way. He measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:28) 
Then he brought me to the inner court by the south way. He measured the south gate according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:29) 
Its chambers, its pillars, and its jambs were according to these same measurements. There were windows around it and in its jambs, the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:30) 
And the jambs of the inner court were twenty-five cubits, and to the gate of the inner court, twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:31) 
And the jambs of the outer court faced east, twenty-five cubits, and he measured the pillars and the jambs according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:32) 
And there were windows around it, and in its jambs; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:33) 
The jambs of the inner court faced the east way, twenty-five cubits, and he measured the pillars and the jambs according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:34) 
And there were windows around it, and in its jambs; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:35) 
Then he brought me by the north way to the gate. And he measured it according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:36) 
Its chambers, its pillars, and its jambs, and the windows around it; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:37) 
And its pillars were to the outer court, and palm trees on its pillars on this side and on that side, and its steps were eight.

(Ezekiel 40:38) 
And the chamber and its entrance were by the pillars; there was a washing place for washing the burnt offerings.

(Ezekiel 40:39) 
In the entrance of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which they were to slaughter the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering.

(Ezekiel 40:40) 
On the outer side, as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables, and on the other side, opposite the vestibule of the gate, were two tables.

(Ezekiel 40:41) 
There were four tables on this side and on that side, at the width of one table, and on the side of one table, on which they slaughtered.

(Ezekiel 40:42) 
And there were four stone tables for the burnt offerings, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they placed the vessels with which they slaughtered the burnt offerings and sacrifices.

(Ezekiel 40:43) 
And there were hooks, a handbreadth long, inside all around, and on the tables was the flesh of the offerings.

(Ezekiel 40:44) 
Then he brought me to the inner court, and behold, there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate, facing the south way, and one at the side of the south gate, facing the north way.

(Ezekiel 40:45) 
And he said to me: “This chamber, which faces the north way, is for the priests who keep the service of the house.

(Ezekiel 40:46) 
And the chamber which faces the south way is for the priests who keep the service of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the Lord to minister to him.”

(Ezekiel 40:47) 
Then he measured the court: one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square. And the altar was before the face of the temple.

(Ezekiel 40:48) 
Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple, and he measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side, and the width of the gate, nine cubits, and the depth of the jambs, three cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:49) 
The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width twelve cubits. They went up to it by ten steps, and the pillars were by the jambs, one on this side and one on that side.

(Ezekiel 41:1) 
Afterwards, the angel brought me into the temple, and measured the entrance halls. The width of the entrance was six cubits on one side, and six cubits on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle.

(Ezekiel 41:2) 
The entrance door was ten cubits wide, and the sides of the door were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other. He measured the length of the building, which was forty cubits, and the width, which was twenty.

(Ezekiel 41:3) 
He went inside, and measured the entrance doors, which were two cubits. The door was six cubits wide, and the width of the doors was seven cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:4) 
He measured the length, which was twenty cubits, and the width, which was twenty cubits, in front of the temple. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”

(Ezekiel 41:5) 
Afterwards, he measured the wall of the house, which was six cubits. The width of the side chambers around the house was four cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:6) 
The side chambers were in three rows, and thirty in the corners. The chambers entered into the wall of the house on the sides, to hold them in place, but they did not touch the wall of the house.

(Ezekiel 41:7) 
The side chambers went around the house, and ascended by a spiral staircase. They went around the house, and were wide because of the chambers that went around. Thus, the ascent was from the lower level to the upper level through the middle.

(Ezekiel 41:8) 
I saw also that the house had a height all around. The foundation of the side chambers, was a reed of six cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:9) 
The width of the wall outside the side chambers was five cubits, and what remained of the side chambers between them was nine cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:10) 
He measured the length of the house, which was forty cubits, and the width, which was twenty cubits. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”

(Ezekiel 41:11) 
He measured the side chambers of the house which were one hundred cubits long, and forty cubits wide in the back, and the walls all around.

(Ezekiel 41:12) 
The width of the side chambers was ten cubits underneath. The entrances to the side chambers were cubits wide, and their doors faced east, which you entered through them.

(Ezekiel 41:13) 
He said to me, “Son of man, these are the side chambers, and this is the measurement of the side chambers, which will be used.

(Ezekiel 41:14) 
He measured the width of the doors, which was twenty cubits. Before the doors there were side chambers, and the entrance went all around.

(Ezekiel 41:15) 
From the front of the entrance to the front of the inner temple, and to the wall of the house, was fifty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:16) 
There were windows in the side chambers, and also in the side chambers all around, and the windows had frames, and on the walls were engraved palm trees.

(Ezekiel 41:17) 
He led me into the outer courtyard. There were chambers and a pavement made of stone all around the courtyard; there were thirty chambers.

(Ezekiel 41:18) 
The chambers were opposite the side of the gates and opposite the way of the side chambers; there were chambers all around, and a paved area.

(Ezekiel 41:19) 
He measured the width, from the front of the inner gate to the front of the outer courtyard, which was one hundred cubits, on the east and on the north.

(Ezekiel 41:20) 
He measured the length and width of the gates of the north, which led to the outer courtyard.

(Ezekiel 41:21) 
Its windows, chambers, and palm tree decorations were according to the measure of the gate that faced east. There were seven steps, and there was an area in front of them.

(Ezekiel 41:22) 
Then he entered into the inner courtyard and measured the same gate.

(Ezekiel 41:23) 
There was a gate to the inner courtyard opposite the north gate, and also facing the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate, which was one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:24) 
He brought me to the way to the south, and behold, the gate to the south, and he measured its entrance halls, and its side chambers, according to the same measurements as before.

(Ezekiel 41:25) 
There were windows in it, and the side chambers all around, just like the former windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:26) 
The steps went up through it, and there was a staircase in the way. The windows were all around: the length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:27) 
The gate of the inner courtyard faced the way to the south, and he measured from the gate to the gate to the south, which was one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:28) 
He brought me into the inner courtyard by the way to the south, and measured according to these measurements.

(Ezekiel 41:29) 
The side chambers, the entrance halls, and the side chambers were according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:1) 
After these things, the angel brought me to the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 42:2) 
And look—the glory of the God of Israel arrived from the east. His voice sounded like the noise of many waters, and the whole earth shone with His glory.

(Ezekiel 42:3) 
The vision I saw resembled the one I had seen when I came to destroy the city. It also looked like the vision I had seen near the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.

(Ezekiel 42:4) 
Then the glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 42:5) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courts. And look—the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

(Ezekiel 42:6) 
I saw a man standing beside the temple. He held a measuring line made of linen in his hand. The man measured the length of the building, which was six cubits. The breadth of the building was six cubits in width.

(Ezekiel 42:7) 
Then he measured the width of the entrance, three cubits, and the width of the doorways, three cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:8) 
He measured the court: twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth. Then he went into the temple.

(Ezekiel 42:9) 
He measured the wall of the temple: two cubits. The width of the building was six cubits, and the breadth of the chambers was seven cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:10) 
He measured the chambers: twenty cubits, and twenty cubits in breadth, opposite the temple. And he said to me:

(Ezekiel 42:11) 
“These chambers facing north are the holy chambers. The priests who offer the holy sacrifices of the sons of Zadok, who guard My sanctuary, will eat there. They will eat the most holy offerings in these chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:12) 
The priests who enter these chambers can go in, but they cannot leave the holy place to enter the outer court. Rather, they will leave their priestly garments there, where they serve, because the garments are holy. They will put on other garments before going out to the people.”

(Ezekiel 42:13) 
He measured the temple: one hundred cubits long, and one hundred cubits in length.

(Ezekiel 42:14) 
He also measured the sides of the building all around: one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:15) 
He measured the length of the building that faced the empty space on both sides, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:16) 
He measured the length of the building that faced the empty space behind it, and the galleries on this and that side, one hundred cubits. And the inner temple and the vestibules of the court were included.

(Ezekiel 42:17) 
Outside of the vestibule, the outer court extended around, and around the court were thirty chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:18) 
The walls between the chambers had windows, and the chambers had windows all around facing the chambers. The walls were decorated with the carvings of palm trees.

(Ezekiel 42:19) 
The outer court faced the road into the chambers to the square. The faces were positioned opposite one another, facing the road of the chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:20) 
He measured the gate of the outer court that faced north. He measured its length, its breadth, its windows, and its palm trees. These were measured according to the measurements of the gate that faced east. One could ascend into it by seven steps.

(Ezekiel 42:21) 
He measured its length: one hundred cubits, and its breadth: fifty cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:22) 
The windows, the palm trees, and the decorations were according to the measurements of the gate that faced east. One ascended into it by seven steps, and there was a vestibule in front of them.

(Ezekiel 42:23) 
There was a gate of the inner court opposite the northern gate and the eastern gate, and he measured from gate to gate: one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:24) 
Then he led me to the southern side, and look—there was the southern gate. He measured its doorways and its posts, following the same measurements as before.

(Ezekiel 42:25) 
There were windows and palm trees on either side of it, and they were according to the measurements of the other gates.

(Ezekiel 42:26) 
There were seven steps by which one could ascend to it, and there was a vestibule in front of them. There were palm trees on each side of its posts.

(Ezekiel 42:27) 
There was a gate of the inner court on the southern side, and he measured from gate to gate: one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:28) 
He led me into the inner court by the southern side, and he measured the southern gate according to those same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:29) 
Its windows, its palm trees, and its posts were according to the measurements of the others. There were windows all around, and in its posts.

(Ezekiel 42:30) 
The gate of the inner court was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits broad, and chambers were in front of it.

(Ezekiel 42:31) 
The outer court’s gate was on the southern side, and there were palm trees on its posts. Its ascent was by eight steps.

(Ezekiel 42:32) 
He led me into the inner court by the eastern side, and he measured the gate according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:33) 
Its windows, its palm trees, and its posts were according to the measurements of the others. There were windows all around, and in its posts.

(Ezekiel 42:34) 
The outer court’s gate was on the eastern side, and he measured the chambers according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:35) 
Then he led me into the inner court by the northern side, and he measured the gate according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:36) 
Its windows, its palm trees, and its posts were according to the measurements of the others. There were windows all around, and in its posts.

(Ezekiel 42:37) 
There were chambers in the posts of the gate where the burnt offerings were washed.

(Ezekiel 42:38) 
At the entrance of the gate were two tables, upon which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were sacrificed.

(Ezekiel 42:39) 
On the outer wall, at the entrance of the gate, were two tables, and on the wall of the gate were two tables where the sacrifices were made.

(Ezekiel 42:40) 
At the entrance of the gate that faced north, there were two tables. Two tables were also at the entrance of the gate that faced south.

(Ezekiel 42:41) 
On both sides of the gate’s wall were four tables. The tables were four cubits long, and the tables were one and a half cubits wide.

(Ezekiel 42:42) 
The tables for the burnt offerings were one and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. The tables were for the vessels used to slaughter the sacrifices.

(Ezekiel 42:43) 
There were hooks of one cubit, placed all around the inner edge of the walls. Upon the tables was the meat of the offerings.

(Ezekiel 42:44) 
He then led me into the inner court, and look—there were tables in the inner court, on both sides of the entrance of the temple.

(Ezekiel 42:45) 
And he said to me, “This table is before the face of the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 42:46) 
Then he led me into the outer court. He led me through the four corners of the court. And look—in each corner of the court was a court.

(Ezekiel 42:47) 
In the corners of the court were cloisters forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. The measurements of the four corners were the same.

(Ezekiel 42:48) 
In each corner of the court there were also buildings thirty cubits wide and forty cubits long. These four had the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:49) 
He entered the vestibule of the gate and measured the gate: twelve cubits high, and six cubits wide.

(Ezekiel 43:1) 
And the angel brought me to the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:2) 
And I looked, and the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. The sound was like the sound of many waters, and the land shone because of his glory.

(Ezekiel 43:3) 
The vision I saw was like the vision I had when I came to destroy the city. The vision was like the one I saw near the river Chebar, and I fell to the ground.

(Ezekiel 43:4) 
And the glory of the Lord came into the temple by the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:5) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and I saw that the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

(Ezekiel 43:6) 
I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple, and a man was standing beside me.

(Ezekiel 43:7) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of my feet, where I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will not defile my holy name again, neither they, nor their kings, by their acts of sexual immorality, nor by the dead bodies of their kings, nor by their high places.

(Ezekiel 43:8) 
They placed their threshold next to my threshold, and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, so that they defiled my holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore, I consumed them in my wrath.

(Ezekiel 43:9) 
Now let them put away their sexual immorality and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell among them forever.

(Ezekiel 43:10) 
Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, and let them be ashamed of their sins, and let them measure the design.

(Ezekiel 43:11) 
And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and entrances, its entire design, all its regulations, and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may observe its entire design, all its regulations, and perform them.

(Ezekiel 43:12) 
This is the law of the temple: The entire area surrounding the summit of the mountain is most holy. So, this is the law of the temple.

(Ezekiel 43:13) 
These are the measurements of the altar in cubits, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. The base of the altar is one cubit high, and its width is one cubit. The rim around it is one handbreadth wide, and this is the height of the altar.

(Ezekiel 43:14) 
From the base of the altar to the lower ledge, two cubits high, and one cubit wide. From the small ledge to the large ledge, four cubits high, and one cubit wide.

(Ezekiel 43:15) 
The altar is four cubits high, and from the altar itself, four horns.

(Ezekiel 43:16) 
The altar is twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide, forming a square at its four corners.

(Ezekiel 43:17) 
The ledge is fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide at its four corners. The rim around it is half a cubit, and its base is one cubit around. Its steps face east.

(Ezekiel 43:18) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: These are the steps that lead to the inner court and the outer court, where the priests, who are the gatekeepers, will be facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:19) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: If the prince gives a gift from the sons of Israel, he must offer a sacrifice for it before the Lord, and he shall make these offerings.

(Ezekiel 43:20) 
The priests will offer an oblation of a holocaust and peace offerings, and they will worship me upon the altar, and they will sacrifice for them.

(Ezekiel 43:21) 
When the prince offers an oblation, he must enter by the way of the court that faces east and offer the holocaust and peace offerings, as he usually does.

(Ezekiel 43:22) 
He will do this in the gateway, and he will offer the holocaust and peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 43:23) 
On the Sabbath day, he shall offer a holocaust of a perfect young bull, six rams, and unblemished rams.

(Ezekiel 43:24) 
On the first day of each month, he will offer a perfect young bull from the herd, and six unblemished lambs from the flock.

(Ezekiel 43:25) 
And he shall offer the holocaust and the peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 43:26) 
On the first day of each month, he will offer a perfect young bull from the herd, and six unblemished lambs from the flock.

(Ezekiel 43:27) 
And he shall offer the holocaust and the peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 44:1) 
Then the Lord brought me back to the way of the outer sanctuary’s gate, which faces east: and it was closed.

(Ezekiel 44:2) 
The Lord said to me, “Son of man, this is the gate by which the princes will enter, so they may eat food before the Lord. They will enter through the vestibule of the gate, and they will exit through the same way.”

(Ezekiel 44:3) 
Then the Lord brought me by the north gate in front of the house: and I saw, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house, and I fell on my face.

(Ezekiel 44:4) 
The Lord said to me, “Son of man, note and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears everything that I speak to you concerning all of the ceremonies of the Lord’s house, and all of its laws. Pay close attention to the entrance to the house, along with all the exits of the sanctuary.”

(Ezekiel 44:5) 
Then you shall say to the house of Israel, who have rebelled: “These are the words of the Lord God: ‘Let all your abominations be enough for you, house of Israel,

(Ezekiel 44:6) 
because you have brought in the foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary and contaminate my house. You have offered my bread, the fat, and the blood. You have broken my covenant by all your abominations.

(Ezekiel 44:7) 
You have not kept my holy ordinances, but you have appointed others to be the keepers of my observances in my sanctuary for you.

(Ezekiel 44:8) 
These are the words of the Lord God: “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter my sanctuary, out of all the foreigners who are among the children of Israel.

(Ezekiel 44:9) 
“But the Levites who departed from me, when Israel went astray, and went after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 44:10) 
They will be ministers in my sanctuary, and keepers of the gates of the house, and ministers in the house: they themselves will slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices of the people, and they shall stand before them, in order to minister to them.

(Ezekiel 44:11) 
Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel: therefore, I raised my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 44:12) 
They will not approach me to function as priests to me, nor to any of my holy things, nor to the most holy things: but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

(Ezekiel 44:13) 
And I will give them to be the keepers of the house’s observances, in all its ministry, and in all things that are done in it.

(Ezekiel 44:14) 
“But the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the ceremonies of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall approach me, to minister to me, and they shall stand before me, to offer me fat and blood, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 44:15) 
“They shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and keep my observances.

(Ezekiel 44:16) 
“When they enter the gate of the inner court, they will wear linen tunics, and they will not put on anything that causes sweat, when they minister in the gate of the inner court and inside.

(Ezekiel 44:17) 
“They will have linen helmets on their heads, and linen breeches will be put on: they will not gird themselves in sweat.

(Ezekiel 44:18) 
“When they go out to the outer court to the people, they will take off their garments in which they ministered, and cover themselves with other clothes: so they do not sanctify the people in their garments.

(Ezekiel 44:19) 
“They will not shave their heads, nor will they let their hair grow long, but they will trim their heads.

(Ezekiel 44:20) 
“No priest shall drink wine when they are about to enter the inner court.

(Ezekiel 44:21) 
“They will not take a widow or a divorced woman for a wife, but they will take virgins of the house of Israel’s seed, or those who have fallen from the widowhood of the priests.

(Ezekiel 44:22) 
“They shall teach the people what is between the holy and the profane, and what is between the polluted and the clean they shall show to them.

(Ezekiel 44:23) 
“And in a matter of judgment they shall stand, and they shall judge according to my judgments: and they will keep my laws and my ordinances in all my solemnities, and they shall sanctify my Sabbaths.

(Ezekiel 44:24) 
“They will not enter to a dead person, lest they become contaminated, but they will be contaminated in their father and in their mother, and in their son and in their daughter, brother and sister, when they die.

(Ezekiel 44:25) 
“And after they are purified, they will count for seven days.

(Ezekiel 44:26) 
“On the day that they enter into the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, they shall offer for their sin, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 44:27) 
“It shall be for them as an inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you will not give them a possession in Israel: for I am their possession.

(Ezekiel 44:28) 
“They will eat the offering for sin, and for the offense, and every vow in Israel shall be theirs.

(Ezekiel 44:29) 
“And everything that is offered from the firstfruits and from all that is vowed, shall be theirs.

(Ezekiel 44:30) 
“The firstfruits of all your produce, and everything that is offered as a gift of your hands, shall be for the priests: and you will give the firstfruits of your flour to the priest, and he shall bless your house.

(Ezekiel 44:31) 
“The priests shall not eat anything that has died a natural death, or has been torn to pieces, whether birds or animals.

(Ezekiel 45:1) 
When you divide the land, set aside a portion for the Lord, making it holy.

(Ezekiel 45:2) 
The length will be twenty-five thousand units of measure, and the width ten thousand. This area will be holy on all sides.

(Ezekiel 45:3) 
You will measure out of this area a length of twenty-five thousand units of measure, and a width of ten thousand. There will be the holy sanctuary and the holiest of holies there.

(Ezekiel 45:4) 
The holy part of the land will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who serve the Lord. It will be their place for houses and holy places for the sanctuary.

(Ezekiel 45:5) 
Twenty-five thousand units of measure in length, and ten thousand in width, will be for the Levites, who minister in the house. They will possess twenty chambers.

(Ezekiel 45:6) 
You will give the city's possession a width of five thousand units of measure, and a length of twenty-five thousand, next to the holy portion, for all the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:7) 
You will give to the prince from both sides of the sanctuary's possession and the city's possession, before the separation of the sanctuary and the city's possession, from the west side to the east side. The prince will be in the possession on both sides of the borders.

(Ezekiel 45:8) 
He will possess land. My princes will not spoil my people's possession any further. But they will give the possession to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.

(Ezekiel 45:9) 
This is what the Lord God says: “Enough, you leaders of Israel! Stop your violence and robbery! Do what is just and right. Stop oppressing my people,

(Ezekiel 45:10) 
Use an honest balance, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. The ephah and the bath will have the same measure, able to hold a tenth of a homer.

(Ezekiel 45:11) 
This is the measure: The ephah and the bath are one unit. The homer is ten ephahs.

(Ezekiel 45:12) 
The sixth part of the ephah is equal to one homer. One sixth of a bath is one measure, according to the bath.

(Ezekiel 45:13) 
This is the offering you are to present: one sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.

(Ezekiel 45:14) 
The portion of oil will be one bath of oil for every ten baths of the homer, because ten baths make a homer.

(Ezekiel 45:15) 
You must sacrifice one sheep from every two hundred in the pastures of Israel, for a sin offering, and a burnt offering, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them,

(Ezekiel 45:16) 
All the people of the land will give this holy offering to the leaders of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:17) 
It will be the prince's duty to provide the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings, at the festivals, the Sabbaths, and the new moons, at all the festivals of the house of Israel. He will make the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:18) 
This is what the Lord God says: “In the first month, on the first day of the month, you must take a young, perfect bull, and purify the sanctuary.

(Ezekiel 45:19) 
The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, on the four corners of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate of the inner court.

(Ezekiel 45:20) 
You must do the same on the seventh day of the month, for anyone who has made a mistake or is ignorant, to make atonement for the house.

(Ezekiel 45:21) 
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will have the Passover, a seven-day festival, and you will eat unleavened bread.

(Ezekiel 45:22) 
The prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.

(Ezekiel 45:23) 
During the seven days of the festival, the prince will provide a burnt offering to the Lord: seven young, perfect bulls and seven perfect rams each day, and a male goat each day, as a sin offering.

(Ezekiel 45:24) 
He will provide a grain offering and a drink offering with each burnt offering for seven days. He will provide the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the oil for a drink offering.

(Ezekiel 45:25) 
In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the festival, he will do the same for seven days, according to the law of the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the oil for a drink offering.

(Ezekiel 46:1) 
The Lord God says, “The inner gate of the east court will be shut for six days a week. But on the Sabbath, it will be opened; and it will also be opened on the first day of the month.

(Ezekiel 46:2) 
The prince will enter through the entrance of the outer gate, and he will stand in the vestibule of the gate. He will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He will worship at the threshold of the gate. He will exit, and the gate will not be shut until evening.

(Ezekiel 46:3) 
The people of the land will worship at the entrance to that gate, in the presence of the Lord, on the Sabbaths and on the first day of the month.

(Ezekiel 46:4) 
The burnt offering that the prince offers to the Lord on the Sabbath will be six unblemished rams and one unblemished ram.

(Ezekiel 46:5) 
He will offer a grain offering of one ephah for the ram, and he will offer a grain offering as much as he is able for the rams, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:6) 
On the first day of the month, he will offer a young, unblemished bull, six unblemished lambs, and one unblemished ram.

(Ezekiel 46:7) 
He will offer a grain offering of one ephah for the bull, one ephah for the ram. And for the lambs, he will offer whatever he is able, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:8) 
When the prince enters, he will enter by the way of the vestibule, and he will exit by the same way.

(Ezekiel 46:9) 
When the people of the land come before the Lord during the feasts, the one who enters by way of the north gate to worship will exit by way of the south gate. The one who enters by the south gate will exit by the north gate. They will not return by the way of the gate by which they entered, but they will exit opposite it.

(Ezekiel 46:10) 
The prince will enter in their midst when they enter, and when they exit. The gate will not be shut.

(Ezekiel 46:11) 
Also during the festivals and solemnities, the offering will be one ephah for a bull, and one ephah for a ram. For the lambs, it will be as much as he is able, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:12) 
When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offerings, the gate that faces east will be opened for him. He will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, just as he does on the Sabbath. He will exit, and after he has exited, the gate will be shut.

(Ezekiel 46:13) 
Each day, you will offer a burnt offering to the Lord, a one-year-old, unblemished lamb. You will offer it in the morning.

(Ezekiel 46:14) 
You will offer a grain offering with it in the morning, a sixth part of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to mix with the flour, as a grain offering to the Lord, always by right.

(Ezekiel 46:15) 
They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning, as a perpetual burnt offering.

(Ezekiel 46:16) 
The Lord God says: “If the prince gives a gift to one of his sons, it will be the inheritance of his sons. He will possess it as his inheritance.

(Ezekiel 46:17) 
But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to him until the year of remission. It will return to the prince. The inheritance will be for his sons.

(Ezekiel 46:18) 
He will not take from the people’s inheritance to expel them from their possession, but from his own possession he will inherit his inheritance for his sons.”

(Ezekiel 46:19) 
He led me through the way that was next to the gate, to the treasury of the sanctuary of the priests, which faced north. There was a place there at its side, facing west.

(Ezekiel 46:20) 
He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will cook the sin offering and the trespass offering. They will cook it so that they do not transfer it into the court of the people.”

(Ezekiel 46:21) 
Then he led me into the outer court and led me around the four corners of the court. There was a court in the corner of the court.

(Ezekiel 46:22) 
In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide. The measure was the same in all four.

(Ezekiel 46:23) 
There was a structure around all of them. Under the courts, there was a structure around them. There was a place for cooking under the structure around.

(Ezekiel 46:24) 
He said to me: “These are the kitchens, where those who minister in the house will cook.”

(Ezekiel 47:1) 
Then he led me back to the door of the temple, and I saw water flowing out from beneath the threshold of the temple toward the east. (For the façade of the temple looked toward the east.) The water came down from the right side of the temple toward the south.

(Ezekiel 47:2) 
And he led me through the way of the north gate and went around me outside to the outer gate to the road facing east. And I saw the water flowing from the right side.

(Ezekiel 47:3) 
The man who had a measuring line in his hand went east. He measured a thousand cubits and then led me through the water, and the water reached my ankles.

(Ezekiel 47:4) 
Then he measured another thousand cubits and led me through the water, and the water reached my knees.

(Ezekiel 47:5) 
He measured another thousand cubits and led me through the water, and the water reached my waist.

(Ezekiel 47:6) 
He measured another thousand cubits, and it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen to such a height that it was deep enough to swim in. It was a river that could not be crossed.

(Ezekiel 47:7) 
He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river.

(Ezekiel 47:8) 
And when I had returned, I saw many trees on both sides of the river.

(Ezekiel 47:9) 
And he said to me, “These waters that are flowing toward the east and descending into the desert will enter the sea and be cast out, and the waters of the sea will be healed.

(Ezekiel 47:10) 
“Wherever the river flows, every living creature that swarms there will live. There will be great numbers of fish, for these waters flow there and the sea will be healed. And everything will live wherever the river goes.

(Ezekiel 47:11) 
“Fishermen will stand beside the sea from Engedi to Eneglaim. They will be places for spreading nets. Their fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.

(Ezekiel 47:12) 
“But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.

(Ezekiel 47:13) 
“On both banks of the river there will grow all kinds of fruit trees. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.”

(Ezekiel 47:14) 
Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will visit you, and I will gather you from the nations, and I will bring you home from the lands where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 47:15) 
“You will come home, and you will remove all of your abominations and all of your offenses.

(Ezekiel 47:16) 
“I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the stony heart from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

(Ezekiel 47:17) 
“I will put My Spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in My statutes and be careful to observe My judgments.

(Ezekiel 47:18) 
“You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you will be My people, and I will be your God.”

(Ezekiel 47:19) 
“And I will deliver you from all your uncleanness. And I will call for the grain and multiply it and will bring no famine on you.

(Ezekiel 47:20) 
“I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field, so that you will not suffer reproach among the nations because of famine.

(Ezekiel 47:21) 
“Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will despise yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.

(Ezekiel 47:22) 
“Not for your sake do I do this, says the Lord God; let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 47:23) 
Thus says the Lord God: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.

(Ezekiel 47:24) 
“And the land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being desolate in the sight of everyone who passes by.

(Ezekiel 47:25) 
“And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the cities that were ruined, desolate, and destroyed are fortified.’

(Ezekiel 47:26) 
“Then the nations that are left all around you will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.”

(Ezekiel 47:27) 
Thus says the Lord God: “In addition to this, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do this for them: I will increase their numbers like a flock of people.

(Ezekiel 47:28) 
“Like the flock for the holy days, like the flock of Jerusalem at its appointed feasts, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 48:1) 
These are the tribes of the sons of Israel. Each will have a gate of its own.

(Ezekiel 48:2) 
From the northern boundary, the length begins at the road of Hethalon, to the entrance of Emath, and at the boundary of Damascus, near the road of Emath. The eastern and western boundaries are Dan.

(Ezekiel 48:3) 
Near the border of Dan, on the east side, to the sea, Asher will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:4) 
Near the border of Asher, on the east side, to the sea, Naphtali will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:5) 
Near the border of Naphtali, on the east side, to the sea, Manasseh will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:6) 
Near the border of Manasseh, on the east side, to the sea, Ephraim will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:7) 
Near the border of Ephraim, on the east side, to the sea, Reuben will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:8) 
Near the border of Reuben, on the east side, to the sea, Judah will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:9) 
Near the border of Judah, on the east side, to the sea, this is the portion you shall set aside.

(Ezekiel 48:10) 
The sacred portion will be twenty-five thousand units long, and ten thousand units wide. This will be the priests' part.

(Ezekiel 48:11) 
This is the portion for the priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept my ceremonies and did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.

(Ezekiel 48:12) 
It will be their sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, near the border of the Levites.

(Ezekiel 48:13) 
The Levites will have a portion near the priests' borders, twenty-five thousand units long, and ten thousand units wide.

(Ezekiel 48:14) 
They may not sell or exchange any of it, nor transfer the first fruits of the land, for they are sanctified to the Lord.

(Ezekiel 48:15) 
The rest, which remains in width, will be five thousand units. It will be for the city, for dwellings and suburbs. The city will be in their midst.

(Ezekiel 48:16) 
This is the city's measurement: on the north side, four thousand five hundred; on the south, four thousand five hundred; on the east, four thousand five hundred; and on the west, four thousand five hundred.

(Ezekiel 48:17) 
The city's suburbs will be: on the north side, two hundred and fifty units; on the south side, two hundred and fifty; on the east side, two hundred and fifty; and on the west, two hundred and fifty.

(Ezekiel 48:18) 
The rest of the length, according to the measurement of the holy portion, will be ten thousand units on the east, and ten thousand on the west, and its fruit will be for food for the city.

(Ezekiel 48:19) 
Those who work in the city will work from all the tribes of Israel.

(Ezekiel 48:20) 
All the portions, twenty-five thousand units in length, and ten thousand in width, will be from the sacred portion.

(Ezekiel 48:21) 
The remaining portion, from the portion of the priests and the Levites, will belong to the leaders, twenty-five thousand units in length and ten thousand in width. Their portion will be holy.

(Ezekiel 48:22) 
From the possession of the Levites and the priests, it will be in the middle, and it will be between the borders of Judah and Benjamin.

(Ezekiel 48:23) 
As for the other tribes, from the east side to the sea, Benjamin will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:24) 
Near the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the sea, Simeon will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:25) 
Near the border of Simeon, from the east side to the sea, Issachar will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:26) 
Near the border of Issachar, from the east side to the sea, Zebulun will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:27) 
Near the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the sea, Gad will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:28) 
Near the border of Gad, towards the south, the border will be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, and to the torrent, to the great sea.

(Ezekiel 48:29) 
This is the land that you will divide by lot among the tribes of Israel. These are their portions, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 48:30) 
These are the exits of the city: on the north side, four thousand five hundred.

(Ezekiel 48:31) 
The gates of the city, according to the tribes of Israel: three gates on the north side: the gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

(Ezekiel 48:32) 
On the east side, four thousand five hundred, and three gates: the gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.

(Ezekiel 48:33) 
On the south side, four thousand five hundred, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.

(Ezekiel 48:34) 
On the west side, four thousand five hundred, and three gates: the gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.

(Ezekiel 48:35) 
The city will be surrounded by eighteen thousand units, and the name of the city from that day forward will be: The Lord Is There.

(Daniel 1:1) 
In the third year of the reign of Joakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

(Daniel 1:2) 
And the Lord gave Joakim, the king of Judah, into his hand, along with a portion of the vessels of the house of God, and he carried them off to the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god. He then placed the vessels in the house of the treasury of his god.

(Daniel 1:3) 
Then the king spoke to Asphenez, the chief of the eunuchs, ordering him to bring in some of the sons of Israel, both from the royal family and from the nobles,

(Daniel 1:4) 
young men without any defects, handsome, and skilled in all wisdom, learned, and possessing knowledge, and those who could stand in the king's palace, so that they might teach them the letters and the language of the Chaldeans.

(Daniel 1:5) 
Among them were Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, who were from the sons of Judah.

(Daniel 1:6) 
And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Belteshazzar; to Ananias, Shadrach; to Misael, Meshach; and to Azarias, Abed-nego.

(Daniel 1:7) 
But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food or with the wine that he drank. Therefore, he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled.

(Daniel 1:8) 
And God gave Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs.

(Daniel 1:9) 
And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. If he sees your faces looking worse than those of the other young men of your age, what will happen to my head because of you?”

(Daniel 1:10) 
Then Daniel said to the guard whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:

(Daniel 1:11) 
“Please test us for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.

(Daniel 1:12) 
Then let our faces be examined before you, as well as the faces of the young men who eat the king's food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.”

(Daniel 1:13) 
So, when he heard this, he tested them for ten days.

(Daniel 1:14) 
And after ten days, their faces appeared better and their bodies more robust than all the young men who ate the king's food.

(Daniel 1:15) 
So Malasar continued to provide them with food and drink and vegetables.

(Daniel 1:16) 
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom. And Daniel understood all visions and dreams.

(Daniel 1:17) 
When the time came for them to be brought in, as the king had commanded, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

(Daniel 1:18) 
And when the king spoke with them, he found none like Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias. So they stood before the king.

(Daniel 1:19) 
And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in his whole kingdom.

(Daniel 1:20) 
And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.

(Daniel 2:1) 
In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and his spirit was so troubled that he couldn't sleep.

(Daniel 2:2) 
So the king commanded all the magicians, sorcerers, enchanters, and astrologers to tell him his dream. And they all stood before the king.

(Daniel 2:3) 
The king told them, "I've had a dream, and I am troubled. I don't even know what it was."

(Daniel 2:4) 
The Chaldeans answered the king in the Aramaic language, "May the king live forever. Tell us the dream, your servants, and we will tell you the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:5) 
The king replied to the Chaldeans, "I have made a decision. If you don't tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn apart, and your houses will be demolished."

(Daniel 2:6) 
But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will receive rewards, gifts, and great honor from me. So tell me the dream and its interpretation."

(Daniel 2:7) 
They answered again, "Tell the dream to your servants, O king, and we will show you the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:8) 
The king replied, "I know you are trying to gain time, because you know that the thing has been decided by me."

(Daniel 2:9) 
If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one verdict for you. You have prepared lying and deceitful words to speak before me, until the situation changes. So tell me the dream, so that I can know that you can also tell me its true interpretation."

(Daniel 2:10) 
The Chaldeans responded to the king, saying, "There is not a man on earth who can tell the king this. The king demands something that is beyond human ability; there is no one else who can tell the king, except for the gods, and they do not live among humans."

(Daniel 2:11) 
Because of this, the king became furious and very angry and ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:12) 
When the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed, Daniel and his companions were sought so that they could also be executed.

(Daniel 2:13) 
Then Daniel, with his wisdom, responded to Arioch, the chief of the king's guards, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:14) 
And he asked, "Why did the king issue such a quick decree?" Arioch replied, "Because I have found some of the exiles from Judah who can tell the king the interpretation of the dream."

(Daniel 2:15) 
Daniel went in and asked the king for time to explain the interpretation to him.

(Daniel 2:16) 
Daniel then went to his companions and asked them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions would not be executed with the other wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:17) 
Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision in his dream. Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

(Daniel 2:18) 
Daniel responded, saying: "Blessed be the name of God from eternity to eternity because wisdom and power belong to Him."

(Daniel 2:19) 
He changes times and seasons; He deposes kings and establishes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who know mysteries.

(Daniel 2:20) 
He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what is in darkness, and the light dwells with Him.

(Daniel 2:21) 
I give thanks and praise to you, God of my ancestors, for You have given me wisdom and power. And now You have made known to me what we asked of You, for You have made known to us the king's message."

(Daniel 2:22) 
Therefore, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to kill the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not kill the wise men of Babylon. Bring me before the king, and I will show him the interpretation."

(Daniel 2:23) 
Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, "I have found a man of the exiles from Judah who will make known the interpretation to the king."

(Daniel 2:24) 
The king responded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Can you tell me the dream that I saw and its interpretation?"

(Daniel 2:25) 
Daniel answered the king, saying, "The mystery that the king is asking cannot be revealed to the king by wise men, magicians, enchanters, or astrologers."

(Daniel 2:26) 
But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. And He has made known to you, O king Nebuchadnezzar, what will happen in the last days. Your dream and the visions of your head upon your bed are these:

(Daniel 2:27) 
As for you, O king, your thoughts came to your mind concerning what would happen after this, and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will happen.

(Daniel 2:28) 
As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have more wisdom than anyone else, but so that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.

(Daniel 2:29) 
You, O king, saw a great statue. That great statue, shining with extraordinary brilliance, stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying.

(Daniel 2:30) 
The head of the statue was made of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,

(Daniel 2:31) 
its legs of iron, and its feet, partly of iron and partly of clay.

(Daniel 2:32) 
You were looking on until a stone was cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands; and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.

(Daniel 2:33) 
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were all crushed together and became like chaff on the summer threshing floor; the wind blew them away, so that no trace of them could be found.

(Daniel 2:34) 
But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

(Daniel 2:35) 
This is the dream; now we will tell the interpretation before the king.

(Daniel 2:36) 
You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the glory.

(Daniel 2:37) 
Wherever the children of humanity live, and the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has made you rule over all of them; you are the head of gold.

(Daniel 2:38) 
And after you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.

(Daniel 2:39) 
And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, for as iron breaks in pieces and crushes everything, so shall it break in pieces and crush all these.

(Daniel 2:40) 
And whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potters' clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with the clay of the potter.

(Daniel 2:41) 
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.

(Daniel 2:42) 
And as you saw iron mixed with clay, they will mingle with the seed of men, but they will not cleave to one another, even as iron cannot be mixed with clay.

(Daniel 2:43) 
And in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be given to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

(Daniel 2:44) 
Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the clay, the iron, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass after this; the dream is true, and the interpretation of it is faithful.

(Daniel 2:45) 
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid homage to Daniel and commanded that they should present to him sacrifices and incense.

(Daniel 2:46) 
The king answered Daniel, saying, "Truly, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this secret."

(Daniel 2:47) 
Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.

(Daniel 2:48) 
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king's court.

(Daniel 3:1) 
King Nebuchadnezzar built a golden statue, sixty cubits tall and six cubits wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.

(Daniel 3:2) 
He then sent out word to summon the satraps, magistrates, judges, generals, nobles, prefects, and all the leaders of the provinces, so they would come to the dedication of the statue he had set up.

(Daniel 3:3) 
So the satraps, magistrates, judges, generals, nobles, prefects, and all the leaders of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. They stood before the statue that he had placed there.

(Daniel 3:4) 
Then a herald proclaimed loudly: "People, nations, and language groups, you are commanded:

(Daniel 3:5) 
When you hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, and cithara, the sambuca, harp, and symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, you must immediately bow down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.

(Daniel 3:6) 
Whoever does not worship it will, at that moment, be thrown into a blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:7) 
Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, all the peoples, tribes, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

(Daniel 3:8) 
At that moment, certain Chaldeans came and accused the Jews.

(Daniel 3:9) 
They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever!

(Daniel 3:10) 
You, O king, made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument must bow down and worship the golden statue,

(Daniel 3:11) 
and if anyone does not bow down and worship, he is to be thrown into a blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:12) 
But there are certain Jewish men, whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have disregarded your decree. They do not serve your gods, and they do not worship the golden statue that I have set up.”

(Daniel 3:13) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar, in fury and anger, commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. And they were immediately brought before the king.

(Daniel 3:14) 
King Nebuchadnezzar spoke to them and said, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods, and that you do not worship the golden statue that I have set up?

(Daniel 3:15) 
Now, therefore, if you are ready, whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, cithara, sambuca, harp, symphony, and every kind of musical instrument, bow down and worship the statue that I have made. But if you do not worship, I do not know what god will rescue you from my hand.”

(Daniel 3:16) 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar, “We do not need to answer you about this matter.

(Daniel 3:17) 
Behold, our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the blazing furnace of fire, and to deliver us from your hand, O king.

(Daniel 3:18) 
But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue that you have set up.”

(Daniel 3:19) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the appearance of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered that the furnace be heated seven times more than it was usually heated.

(Daniel 3:20) 
He commanded certain strong men in his army to bind the feet of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:21) 
Then these men, bound with their tunics, trousers, hats, and other garments, were cast into the middle of the blazing furnace of fire.

(Daniel 3:22) 
Because the king’s command was urgent, the furnace was heated exceedingly hot. But the flames of the fire killed the men who had cast Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into it.

(Daniel 3:23) 
But these three men, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell into the middle of the blazing furnace of fire, bound.

(Daniel 3:24) 
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished, and he quickly rose and said to his nobles, “Did we not cast three men, bound, into the middle of the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “Truly, O king.”

(Daniel 3:25) 
He replied, “Look! I see four men unbound, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm in them, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.”

(Daniel 3:26) 
Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing furnace of fire and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire immediately.

(Daniel 3:27) 
And the satraps, magistrates, judges, and the king’s powerful men gathered to observe these men, and they saw that the fire had no power over their bodies. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their tunics were not damaged, and the smell of fire had not passed over them.

(Daniel 3:28) 
Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him. They defied the king’s word, and yielded their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.

(Daniel 3:29) 
Therefore, I have made a decree that any people, tribe, or language group that speaks against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses shall be made into a garbage heap. For there is no other god who can save in this way.”

(Daniel 3:30) 
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

(Daniel 4:1) 
From King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth: may peace be multiplied to you.

(Daniel 4:2) 
It seemed good to me to reveal the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.

(Daniel 4:3) 
How great are His signs, and how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His power is unto all generations.

(Daniel 4:4) 
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.

(Daniel 4:5) 
I saw a dream which terrified me; and my thoughts in my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.

(Daniel 4:6) 
Therefore, I issued a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of the Chaldeans, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.

(Daniel 4:7) 
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and I told the dream before them: but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.

(Daniel 4:8) 
But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and who has in him the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before him.

(Daniel 4:9) 
“Belteshazzar, prince of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that no secret is impossible to you, tell me the vision of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.

(Daniel 4:10) 
This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great.

(Daniel 4:11) 
The tree was great and strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof was to the ends of all the earth.

(Daniel 4:12) 
Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field dwelt under it, and the birds of the air inhabited in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.

(Daniel 4:13) 
I saw in the vision of my head in my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.

(Daniel 4:14) 
He cried aloud, and said thus: “Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts fly from under it, and the birds from its branches.

(Daniel 4:15) 
Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be bound with a band of iron and brass, among the grass, outside.

(Daniel 4:16) 
Let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the earth, till seven times pass over it.

(Daniel 4:17) 
This is the decree of the watchers, and the sentence of the holy ones, and the demand, that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men: and He will give it to whomever He will, and He will appoint the most humble of men over it.”

(Daniel 4:18) 
This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. You, therefore, Belteshazzar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom cannot tell me the interpretation; but you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

(Daniel 4:19) 
Then Belteshazzar, whose name is Belteshazzar, was greatly troubled for about an hour: and his thoughts disturbed him. The king answered and said: “Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor its interpretation, trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said: “My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!

(Daniel 4:20) 
The tree that you saw, which was great and strong, whose height reached to heaven, whose sight was to the ends of the earth,

(Daniel 4:21) 
And its branches were beautiful, and its fruit exceedingly much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and the birds of the air built their nests, and all flesh was fed from it,

(Daniel 4:22) 
you, O king, are that tree, for you have grown and become strong, and your greatness has grown, and has reached to heaven, and your power to the ends of the whole earth.

(Daniel 4:23) 
And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, “Cut down the tree, and destroy it: but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be bound with a band of iron and brass, among the grass, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts, until seven times pass over it,”

(Daniel 4:24) 
this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which will come upon my lord the king:

(Daniel 4:25) 
They will cast you out from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts; you will eat grass like an ox, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will.

(Daniel 4:26) 
And whereas they commanded that the stump of the roots of the tree should be left in the earth: your kingdom will remain to you, and you will dwell in the earth with the beasts, and you will eat grass like an ox, and you will be wet with the dew of heaven; and seven times will pass over you, until you know that God rules in the kingdom of men.

(Daniel 4:27) 
Therefore, O king, let my counsel please you: and redeem your sins by alms, and your iniquities with works of mercy for the poor: perhaps He will forgive your sins.

(Daniel 4:28) 
All these things came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.

(Daniel 4:29) 
At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the king of Babylon.

(Daniel 4:30) 
The king spoke, and said: “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the house of the kingdom, in the strength of my power, and in the glory of my splendor?”

(Daniel 4:31) 
While this word was still in the mouth of the king, a voice came down from heaven: “To you it is spoken, O king Nebuchadnezzar: The kingdom is departed from you.

(Daniel 4:32) 
And they will cast you out from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts; you will eat grass like an ox, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.”

(Daniel 4:33) 
In that very hour, the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was cast out from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hairs grew like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

(Daniel 4:34) 
Now at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven: and my understanding returned to me: and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified Him that lives forever: whose power is an everlasting power, and His kingdom is to generation and generation.

(Daniel 4:35) 
And all the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing before Him: because He does according to His will in the power of the heavens, and in the inhabitants of the earth: and there is no one who can resist His hand and say to Him: “Why have you done this?”

(Daniel 4:36) 
At that time, my understanding returned to me: and I returned to the honor of my kingdom, and to my beauty: and my glory was restored to me: and my ministers and my officers sought me, and I was established in my kingdom: and my greatness was added to me.

(Daniel 4:37) 
Now, therefore, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all His works are true, and His ways are judgments, and those who walk in pride He can humiliate.

(Daniel 5:1) 
King Baltassar held a huge banquet for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them.

(Daniel 5:2) 
Baltassar, fired up by the wine, ordered that the gold and silver vessels be brought in. His father Nabuchodonosor had taken these vessels from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines could drink from them.

(Daniel 5:3) 
So the gold and silver vessels, which had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem, were brought in. And the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.

(Daniel 5:4) 
They drank wine, and they praised their gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

(Daniel 5:5) 
In that very hour, the fingers of a man’s hand appeared, writing on the wall of the king’s palace. The king was watching the hand as it wrote.

(Daniel 5:6) 
Then the king’s face changed, and his thoughts disturbed him. His waist joints loosened, and his knees were knocking together.

(Daniel 5:7) 
The king cried out loudly that the magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers be brought in. He spoke to the wise men of Babylon, saying: “Whoever reads this writing and makes its interpretation known to me, he shall be clothed in purple, and shall have a gold chain on his neck, and he shall rule as the third in my kingdom.”

(Daniel 5:8) 
Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could neither read the writing nor explain its meaning to the king.

(Daniel 5:9) 
So King Baltassar was terrified, and his face was changed, and his nobles were also greatly disturbed.

(Daniel 5:10) 
The queen, because of the king’s words and those of his nobles, entered the banquet hall, and she said: “O king, live forever. Do not be terrified by your thoughts, and do not let your face change.”

(Daniel 5:11) 
There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods within him. In the days of your father, wisdom, understanding, and the knowledge of wisdom were found in him, according to the spirit of the gods. For King Nabuchodonosor, your father, appointed him as chief of the magicians, soothsayers, Chaldeans, and diviners,

(Daniel 5:12) 
because a greater spirit, knowledge, understanding, the interpretation of dreams, the revealing of secrets, and the solving of difficult questions were found in him. This is Daniel, whom the king named Baltassar. Now, therefore, let Daniel be called, and he will explain the meaning.”

(Daniel 5:13) 
Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him: “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought here from Judah?”

(Daniel 5:14) 
I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is within you, and that wisdom, understanding, and greater knowledge are found in you.

(Daniel 5:15) 
Now the wise men and the magicians have come before me to read this writing and to explain its meaning to me, but they could not explain the meaning of the message.

(Daniel 5:16) 
But I have heard about you that you can interpret obscure things and solve difficult questions. Therefore, if you can read this writing and explain its meaning to me, you shall be clothed in purple, and you shall have a gold chain around your neck, and you shall rule as the third in my kingdom.”

(Daniel 5:17) 
Then Daniel answered and said before the king: “Let your gifts be for you, and give your rewards to someone else, but I will read the writing to you, O king, and I will show you its interpretation.

(Daniel 5:18) 
O king, the Most High God gave Nabuchodonosor, your father, a kingdom, greatness, glory, and honor.

(Daniel 5:19) 
And because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, tribes, and languages trembled and feared him. Whoever he wanted, he killed; whoever he wanted, he struck down; whoever he wanted, he exalted; and whoever he wanted, he humbled.

(Daniel 5:20) 
But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit became hardened in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory was taken away.

(Daniel 5:21) 
He was driven away from the sons of men, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God has power over the kingdom of men and raises up over it whomever He wills.”

(Daniel 5:22) 
And you, his son Baltassar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,

(Daniel 5:23) 
but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels of His house were brought before you, and you, your nobles, your wives, and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which neither see nor hear nor know. But the God who holds your life in His hand and who directs all your ways, you did not glorify.

(Daniel 5:24) 
Therefore, the hand was sent from Him, and this writing was inscribed.

(Daniel 5:25) 
And this is the writing that was inscribed: “Mane, Thecel, Phares.”

(Daniel 5:26) 
And this is the interpretation of the word: “Mane” – God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end.

(Daniel 5:27) 
“Thecel” – You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.

(Daniel 5:28) 
“Phares” – Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

(Daniel 5:29) 
Then Baltassar gave the order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, and they put a gold chain around his neck, and they announced concerning him that he should have power as the third in his kingdom.

(Daniel 5:30) 
That very night, Baltassar the king of the Chaldeans was killed.

(Daniel 6:1) 
Darius decided to set up one hundred twenty governors, who were to be in charge of the whole kingdom;

(Daniel 6:2) 
and over them, three administrators, one of whom was Daniel, so that the governors would have to report to them, and the king would take no loss.

(Daniel 6:3) 
Daniel surpassed all of the administrators and governors because the Spirit of God was great within him.

(Daniel 6:4) 
The king was thinking of setting him up to have authority over the whole kingdom.

(Daniel 6:5) 
Therefore, the administrators and governors were looking for a reason to bring charges against Daniel concerning the business of the kingdom, but they were unable to find any fault or corruption in him, because he was faithful, and there was no fault or suspicion in him.

(Daniel 6:6) 
So these men said, “We will not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.”

(Daniel 6:7) 
So these administrators and governors rushed to the king and said to him, “King Darius, live forever!

(Daniel 6:8) 
All of the administrators of the kingdom, magistrates, and governors have agreed that the king should make a law that anyone who petitions any God or man for thirty days, except you, O king, should be cast into the pit of the lions.

(Daniel 6:9) 
Now, O king, confirm the decree and sign the prohibition, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians.”

(Daniel 6:10) 
Therefore King Darius made the decree and signed the prohibition.

(Daniel 6:11) 
But when Daniel learned that the decree had been written, he went into his house, and in his upper chamber, with his windows open, three times a day he was kneeling, praying, and giving thanks before his God, just as he had been accustomed to doing before.

(Daniel 6:12) 
Then those men, considering the situation, found Daniel praying and imploring his God.

(Daniel 6:13) 
And they came and spoke to the king about the decree. They said, “Did you establish a decree, O king, that every man who asks a petition of any God or man within thirty days, except you, O king, should be cast into the pit of the lions?”

(Daniel 6:14) 
The king answered and said, “The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not allowed to change.”

(Daniel 6:15) 
Then they answered and said before the king, “Daniel, who is from the sons of the captivity of Judah, has not cared about your law, O king, nor about the decree that you made, but three times a day he makes his supplications.”

(Daniel 6:16) 
When the king heard this, he was very sad, and he set his heart on freeing Daniel, and until sunset he worked to rescue him.

(Daniel 6:17) 
But those men, considering the matter before the king, said, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that every decree which the king establishes may not be changed.”

(Daniel 6:18) 
Then the king ordered, and Daniel was brought and cast into the pit of the lions. And the king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you always worship, Himself deliver you.”

(Daniel 6:19) 
Then a single stone was brought, and it was placed over the mouth of the pit, which the king sealed with his own ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that nothing should happen against Daniel.

(Daniel 6:20) 
Then the king went out to his palace, and he went to sleep without eating, and food was not brought before him, and also sleep departed from him.

(Daniel 6:21) 
Then the king, rising at dawn, went in haste to the pit of the lions.

(Daniel 6:22) 
And when he approached the pit, he cried out with a sorrowful voice to Daniel and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you always serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?”

(Daniel 6:23) 
Then Daniel, answering the king, said, “O king, live forever!

(Daniel 6:24) 
My God sent His angel and shut the mouths of the lions, and they did not harm me, because before Him justice was found in me, and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”

(Daniel 6:25) 
Then the king rejoiced over him, and he ordered Daniel to be brought up out of the pit, and Daniel was brought up out of the pit, and no injury was found in him because he had believed in his God.

(Daniel 6:26) 
And the king ordered, and those men who had accused Daniel were brought, and they were cast into the pit of lions, they, their children, and their wives, and before they reached the ground of the pit, the lions rushed upon them and crushed all of them.

(Daniel 6:27) 
Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, tribes, and languages dwelling in all the earth, “May your peace be multiplied.

(Daniel 6:28) 
I have made a decree that in all my kingdom they should tremble and fear the God of Daniel, for He is the living God, and He endures forever, and His kingdom is that which will not be corrupted, and His power endures to the end.

(Daniel 6:29) 
He is a deliverer and a savior, working signs and wonders in the universe and on the earth, who delivered Daniel from the pit of the lions.”

(Daniel 6:30) 
So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

(Daniel 7:1) 
In the first year of Belshazzar’s reign in Babylon, Daniel had a dream. Visions of his head came to him in his bed, and he recorded the dream. He summarized the events he had seen.

(Daniel 7:2) 
Daniel said: “In my vision that night, I saw that four powerful winds from the sky struck the great sea.

(Daniel 7:3) 
Then, four great beasts, each different from the others, arose from the sea.

(Daniel 7:4) 
The first beast was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked off. It was lifted up from the earth and set on its feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.

(Daniel 7:5) 
Then I saw another beast, a second one, that was like a bear. It was propped up on one side, and it had three rows of teeth in its mouth. They said to it, 'Arise! Eat much flesh!'

(Daniel 7:6) 
After this, I saw another beast, like a leopard, with wings like those of a bird on its back. The beast had four heads, and power was given to it.

(Daniel 7:7) 
After this I watched in my visions at night, and saw a fourth beast—fearsome, strong, and exceedingly powerful. It had great iron teeth. It ate and crushed, and it trampled down the rest with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts I had seen before it, and it had ten horns.

(Daniel 7:8) 
As I was considering the horns, I saw another horn, a small one, come up among them. Three of the first horns were uprooted before it. There were eyes like the eyes of a man on this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.

(Daniel 7:9) 
I watched until thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame; its wheels were a burning fire.

(Daniel 7:10) 
A stream of fire issued from before Him. Thousands upon thousands were ministering to Him, and myriads upon myriads were standing before Him. The judgment was set, and the books were opened.

(Daniel 7:11) 
Then I kept watching, because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.

(Daniel 7:12) 
As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, and their lives were prolonged for a time and a season.

(Daniel 7:13) 
I kept watching in the night visions, and I saw one like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of the sky. He came up to the Ancient of Days and was brought before Him.

(Daniel 7:14) 
He was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom is one that shall not be destroyed.

(Daniel 7:15) 
I, Daniel, was deeply troubled in my spirit, and the visions of my head alarmed me.

(Daniel 7:16) 
I approached one of those standing by and asked him the truth about all this. So he told me, and explained the meaning of the words.

(Daniel 7:17) 
“These four great beasts are four kings, who will arise from the earth.

(Daniel 7:18) 
But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will possess the kingdom forever and ever.”

(Daniel 7:19) 
Then I wished to learn the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, which devoured, crushed, and trampled the remainder with its feet.

(Daniel 7:20) 
And I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and about the other horn which had arisen, before which three had fallen. This horn had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and its appearance was greater than the rest.

(Daniel 7:21) 
As I watched, that horn waged war against the holy ones and was prevailing over them,

(Daniel 7:22) 
until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High. The time came, and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.

(Daniel 7:23) 
So he said: “The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be greater than all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.

(Daniel 7:24) 
The ten horns are ten kings who will arise from this kingdom, and after them another will arise. This one will be more powerful than the former, and he will humble three kings.

(Daniel 7:25) 
He will speak against the Most High, and wear down the holy ones of the Most High, and will think to change the times and the laws. They will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.

(Daniel 7:26) 
But the judgment will sit, and his dominion will be taken away. It will be consumed and destroyed to the end.

(Daniel 7:27) 
Then the kingdom, dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under all the sky will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey Him.

(Daniel 7:28) 
This is the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was very troubled by my thoughts, and my face was changed, but I kept the matter in my heart.”

(Daniel 8:1) 
In the third year that king Baltassar reigned, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the things that I had seen in the beginning.

(Daniel 8:2) 
In the vision, I was in Susa, the capital of the province of Elam. And I saw the vision, and was standing near the gate of Ulai.

(Daniel 8:3) 
I raised my eyes, and there was a ram standing before the marsh. It had horns, but the horns were large. One horn was bigger than the other, and it rose up last.

(Daniel 8:4) 
I saw the ram butting with its horns toward the west, the north, and the south. No animals could stand against it, nor could they be saved from its power. It acted according to its will and grew strong.

(Daniel 8:5) 
I considered this, and suddenly, a male goat came from the west, crossing the whole earth. It did not touch the ground. Between its eyes was a prominent horn.

(Daniel 8:6) 
It advanced toward the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing near the marsh. The goat attacked it in a furious rage.

(Daniel 8:7) 
When it approached the ram, the goat became enraged and struck the ram, breaking its horns. The ram could not stand against it. The goat threw the ram to the ground and trampled it. There was no one who could save the ram from the goat's power.

(Daniel 8:8) 
The male goat swelled with pride, but at the peak of his strength, its large horn was broken. In its place, four other horns grew toward the four winds of the sky.

(Daniel 8:9) 
Out of one of them, a small horn came forth, growing strong toward the south, the east, and the promised land.

(Daniel 8:10) 
It became great, even up to the strength of the sky, and it cast down some of the stars and trampled them.

(Daniel 8:11) 
It even grew up to the Prince of the forces of the sky, and through it, the continual sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctification was overthrown.

(Daniel 8:12) 
Because of sin, the forces were given to it against the continual sacrifice. It cast the truth to the ground, and it acted, and it succeeded.

(Daniel 8:13) 
I heard one of the holy ones speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will this vision last, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of desolation? How long will the place of sanctification and the forces be trampled?

(Daniel 8:14) 
He answered, “It will last for two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, and then His sanctified place will be restored.”

(Daniel 8:15) 
When I, Daniel, saw the vision, I sought to understand it. Suddenly, a being like a man stood before me.

(Daniel 8:16) 
I heard a man's voice from the Ulai, who called out, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”

(Daniel 8:17) 
He came and stood near where I was. When he came, I was terrified and fell on my face. He said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”

(Daniel 8:18) 
As he spoke to me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. He touched me and set me in my place.

(Daniel 8:19) 
He said, “I will show you what will happen in the last days, because the vision concerns the time of the end.”

(Daniel 8:20) 
The ram that you saw, with the horns, represents the kings of Media and Persia.

(Daniel 8:21) 
The male goat represents the king of the Greeks, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.

(Daniel 8:22) 
That horn having been broken, and four others rising in its place, represents four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power.

(Daniel 8:23) 
In the last days of these kingdoms, when their iniquities are complete, there will arise a king of fierce appearance and skilled in intrigues.

(Daniel 8:24) 
His power will be great, and he will grow rich with wealth. He will rule with his strength and destroy all.

(Daniel 8:25) 
He will grow in strength in his heart, and through deceit, he will destroy many. He will rise against the Prince of princes, but he will be broken without human intervention.

(Daniel 8:26) 
The vision of the evening and the morning, which was spoken, is true. Therefore, you must seal up the vision, because it refers to many days from now.

(Daniel 8:27) 
I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick. After I saw the vision, there was no one to interpret it.

(Daniel 9:1) 
In the first year of Darius, son of Ahasuerus, of the line of the Medes, who ruled over the Chaldean kingdom:

(Daniel 9:2) 
In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, was reading the prophetic books. I understood the number of years that the Lord had told to the prophet Jeremiah—that Jerusalem would be desolate for seventy years.

(Daniel 9:3) 
And so I turned to God in prayer, fasting, and wearing sackcloth and ashes.

(Daniel 9:4) 
I prayed to the Lord, my God, and I confessed, saying: “O Lord God, great and awesome, you keep your covenant and show mercy to those who love you and keep your commandments:

(Daniel 9:5) 
We have sinned and committed iniquity. We have done evil and have rebelled. We have turned away from your commands and your judgments.

(Daniel 9:6) 
We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our leaders, our fathers, and all the people of the land.

(Daniel 9:7) 
To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness; but to us, shame, as at this day—to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all of Israel, both near and far, in all the countries to which you have driven them because of the transgressions with which they have sinned against you.

(Daniel 9:8) 
O Lord, to us belongs shame, to our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, who have sinned against you.

(Daniel 9:9) 
But to the Lord our God belongs mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him:

(Daniel 9:10) 
And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, by following his law, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

(Daniel 9:11) 
All of Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. So the curse and the oath that are written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against him.

(Daniel 9:12) 
And he has confirmed the words that he spoke against us and against our rulers, by bringing upon us a great evil. Never before under the whole universe has anything like what was done to Jerusalem been done.

(Daniel 9:13) 
As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the Lord our God, turning from our iniquities and understanding your truth.

(Daniel 9:14) 
Therefore the Lord has kept the evil in store and brought it upon us. For the Lord our God is righteous in all his works that he has done, because we did not obey his voice.

(Daniel 9:15) 
And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and have made for yourself a name, as at this day, we have sinned and done evil.

(Daniel 9:16) 
O Lord, in all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all those around us.

(Daniel 9:17) 
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant and his pleas, and for your own sake, make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate.

(Daniel 9:18) 
O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.

(Daniel 9:19) 
O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, pay attention and act! Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your name has been called upon your city and your people.”

(Daniel 9:20) 
While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God,

(Daniel 9:21) 
while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice.

(Daniel 9:22) 
He made me understand, speaking to me, and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding.

(Daniel 9:23) 
At the beginning of your pleas, a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision.

(Daniel 9:24) 
Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.

(Daniel 9:25) 
Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks, it shall be built again with streets and trenches, even in times of distress.

(Daniel 9:26) 
And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end thereof shall be with a flood, and until the end of the war desolations are determined.

(Daniel 9:27) 
And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.”

(Daniel 10:1) 
In the third year of the reign of Cyrus, King of the Persians, God revealed His Word to Daniel, also known as Baltassar. This Word was true and important; Daniel understood the Word, and he had the insight of the vision.

(Daniel 10:2) 
During those days, I, Daniel, was in mourning for three weeks.

(Daniel 10:3) 
I did not eat any of the best foods. Neither meat nor wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself with oil, until the three weeks were finished.

(Daniel 10:4) 
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was beside the great river, which is the Tigris.

(Daniel 10:5) 
I raised my eyes, and I saw: and behold, a man dressed in linen. His waist was girded with the finest gold.

(Daniel 10:6) 
His body was like chrysolite. His face was like a flash of lightning, and his eyes were like a burning lamp. His arms and his feet had the appearance of gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.

(Daniel 10:7) 
I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; the men who were with me did not see it. But they were terrified by a great fear, and fled and hid themselves.

(Daniel 10:8) 
So I was left alone; I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me. My appearance was also changed in me, and I became weak, and I had no strength at all.

(Daniel 10:9) 
Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard them, I fell asleep, with my face on the ground.

(Daniel 10:10) 
Suddenly, a hand touched me, and raised me; and it set me in my place.

(Daniel 10:11) 
He said to me, “Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I am speaking to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” When he said this word to me, I stood trembling.

(Daniel 10:12) 
And he said to me: “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come because of your words.

(Daniel 10:13) 
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me for twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the first princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the king of Persia.

(Daniel 10:14) 
Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision is for many days yet.”

(Daniel 10:15) 
When he said these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was silent.

(Daniel 10:16) 
Then, behold, something like the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, because of your vision, I am terrified and am undone, and no strength remains in me.

(Daniel 10:17) 
For how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? For as for me, strength has immediately been taken from me, and my spirit has not remained in me.”

(Daniel 10:18) 
Again, the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me,

(Daniel 10:19) 
and said: “Do not fear, man of desires, peace be to you; be strong and of good courage.” And when he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said: “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.”

(Daniel 10:20) 
He said, “Do you know why I came to you? Now I will return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come.

(Daniel 10:21) 
However, I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. There is no one to help me against these, except Michael, your prince.

(Daniel 11:1) 
I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, was set to be a support and help to him.

(Daniel 11:2) 
Now, I will announce the truth to you: behold, three more kings will rise up in Persia, and a fourth will be much richer than all the others; and when he gets power and wealth, he will stir up everything against the kingdom of Greece.

(Daniel 11:3) 
Then a strong king will rise, and he will rule with great power, and he will do whatever he pleases.

(Daniel 11:4) 
And when he has risen up, his kingdom will be broken, and it will be divided into the four winds of the sky; but not among his descendants, nor according to the power with which he ruled: for his kingdom will be uprooted, and given to others besides them.

(Daniel 11:5) 
The king of the south will become strong, and one of his princes will prevail over him, and will rule; and his dominion will be a powerful one.

(Daniel 11:6) 
And after years of alliance, the daughter of the king of the south will join the other, to make peace, but she will not have the strength of his arm, nor will she stand, nor will her seed; but she will be handed over, and those who brought her, and those who gave her birth, at this time.

(Daniel 11:7) 
And a shoot from the roots of her seed will rise up, and he will come with an army, and enter into the fortresses of the king of the north; and he will act against them, and prevail.

(Daniel 11:8) 
He will bring their gods, and their idols, and the precious vessels of silver and gold, with the captives, into Egypt; and he will prevail for years over the king of the north.

(Daniel 11:9) 
And the king of the north will enter into his kingdom, and return to his own land.

(Daniel 11:10) 
But his sons will wage war, and they will gather a great multitude; and it will come, rushing, and overflowing, and return, and wage war up to his fortresses.

(Daniel 11:11) 
And the king of the south will be stirred up, and he will go out and fight against the king of the north; and he will prepare a great multitude, and the multitude will be handed over into his hand.

(Daniel 11:12) 
And the multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will be exalted; and he will cast down thousands: but he will not prevail.

(Daniel 11:13) 
For the king of the north will return, and prepare a greater multitude than before; and at the end of the times, he will come rushing, and overflow with a great army.

(Daniel 11:14) 
And in those times many will rise against the king of the south; also the children of the transgressors of your people will rise up to fulfill the vision, but they will fall.

(Daniel 11:15) 
And the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and take fortified cities; and the arms of the south will not be able to hold out, and his chosen ones will not stand firm in their strength.

(Daniel 11:16) 
And he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and there will be no one who can resist him; and he will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand.

(Daniel 11:17) 
And he will set his face to come and seize the whole kingdom, and do it straightforwardly; and he will make a covenant with him; and he will give him the daughter of women, to destroy her; but she will not stand, nor will she be for him.

(Daniel 11:18) 
And he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many; and the commander of the disgrace will cease, and his disgrace will return.

(Daniel 11:19) 
And he will return to his own land, and will fall; and he will not be found.

(Daniel 11:20) 
And in his place will arise one of the disgrace, who will pass through the glory of the kingdom; and he will be broken in a few days, not in battle.

(Daniel 11:21) 
And in his place will arise a contemptible man, and the royal honor will not be given to him; and he will come secretly, and obtain the kingdom by deceit.

(Daniel 11:22) 
And the arms of the flood will flood before him, and they will be broken before him; and also the leader of the covenant.

(Daniel 11:23) 
And after his pact, he will act deceitfully, and will ascend, and will prevail in strength with a small hand.

(Daniel 11:24) 
He will enter into the richest parts of the provinces, and he will do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he will scatter spoils, and plunder, and wealth among them, and will devise his schemes against the fortified cities, for a time.

(Daniel 11:25) 
And he will stir up his forces, and his mind in great power against the king of the south; and this one will be provoked to war with great and very strong forces; but he will not stand, because they will devise schemes against him.

(Daniel 11:26) 
And those who eat his food will break him, and his army will be destroyed; and many will fall slain.

(Daniel 11:27) 
But the hearts of the two kings will be to do evil, and at one table they will speak a lie; but it will not succeed, because the end is still for the appointed day.

(Daniel 11:28) 
And he will return to his land with great wealth, and his heart will be against the holy covenant; and he will act and return to his land.

(Daniel 11:29) 
At the appointed time he will return, and come against the south; but it will not be as it was before, and afterwards.

(Daniel 11:30) 
And the ships of the Kittim will come against him, and he will be grieved, and will return; and he will be angry against the holy covenant, and he will act; and he will return, and consider those who have forsaken the holy covenant.

(Daniel 11:31) 
And arms will arise from him, and they will defile the sanctuary of strength, and take away the continual sacrifice, and set up the abomination that makes desolate.

(Daniel 11:32) 
And the wicked will act deceitfully against the covenant; but the people who know their God will be strong, and will act.

(Daniel 11:33) 
And those who have understanding among the people will instruct many; but they will fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by plunder, for a time.

(Daniel 11:34) 
And when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; and many will be joined to them deceitfully.

(Daniel 11:35) 
And some of the wise will fall, so that they may be tested, and purified, and made white, until the appointed time; because it still has a time.

(Daniel 11:36) 
And the king will act according to his own will; and he will exalt himself, and magnify himself against every god; and against the God of gods he will speak astonishing things, and will prosper until the wrath is completed; because the end is completed.

(Daniel 11:37) 
He will not regard the God of his fathers, nor will he look upon the desires of women, nor will he regard any god; for he will magnify himself against all things.

(Daniel 11:38) 
But in his place he will honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers did not know, he will honor with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and most precious things.

(Daniel 11:39) 
And he will act to fortify the fortresses of the mighty with a foreign god; and he will increase glory, and give them power over many, and divide the land for a price.

(Daniel 11:40) 
And at the appointed time, the king of the south will fight against him; and like a tempest, the king of the north will come against him with chariots, and horsemen, and many ships; and he will enter into the lands, and will subvert, and pass through.

(Daniel 11:41) 
And he will enter into the glorious land, and many will fall; but those who escape his hand will be saved, Edom, and Moab, and the chiefs of the children of Ammon.

(Daniel 11:42) 
And he will stretch out his hand against the lands, and the land of Egypt will not escape.

(Daniel 11:43) 
And he will have dominion over the treasures of gold, and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow his steps.

(Daniel 11:44) 
But messengers from the east and from the north will trouble him; and he will come with a great multitude to destroy and kill many.

(Daniel 11:45) 
And he will set his tabernacle between the seas, in the glorious and holy mountain; and he will come to its summit; but there will be no one to help him.

(Daniel 12:1) 
And at that time, the great Michael, a prince of the angels, will rise to defend your people. Then there will be a time of tribulation the likes of which the world has never seen before. But your people will be delivered, everyone written in the book of life.

(Daniel 12:2) 
And many who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will awaken: some to eternal life, but others will awaken to eternal punishment and disgrace.

(Daniel 12:3) 
Those who are wise will shine like the glory of the universe. And those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever.

(Daniel 12:4) 
But you, Daniel, keep the words secret, and seal the book until the appointed time. Many will travel the earth, and knowledge will increase.

(Daniel 12:5) 
Then I, Daniel, looked, and there stood two others: one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on the other side of the bank of the river.

(Daniel 12:6) 
And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was standing above the waters of the river, "How long will it be until the end of these wonders?"

(Daniel 12:7) 
I heard the man clothed in linen, who was standing above the waters of the river, raise his right hand toward the sky. He swore by Him who lives forever, that it would be a time, times, and half a time. And when the persecution of the holy people ends, all these things will be fulfilled.

(Daniel 12:8) 
And I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, "My Lord, what will be the end of these things?"

(Daniel 12:9) 
He answered, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the appointed time.

(Daniel 12:10) 
Purify yourselves, and make yourselves clean. Many will be refined, and tested, and purified. The wicked will continue to do wrong, and none of the wicked will understand. But those who are wise will understand.

(Daniel 12:11) 
From the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.

(Daniel 12:12) 
Blessed is the one who waits and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.

(Daniel 12:13) 
As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance at the end of days.

(Daniel 13:1) 
A man named Joachim lived in Babylon.

(Daniel 13:2) 
He took a wife named Susanna, the very beautiful daughter of Helcias, who was also a woman of deep faith.

(Daniel 13:3) 
Her parents were upright people and taught Susanna the law of Moses.

(Daniel 13:4) 
Now Joachim was wealthy, and his garden was next to his house. The Jews went to him because he was more respected than the others.

(Daniel 13:5) 
Two elders from the people were appointed as judges that year, of whom the Lord said: "Wickedness has come forth from Babylon from the elders who seemed to be ruling the people."

(Daniel 13:6) 
These elders were in Joachim's house, and all who had business came to them.

(Daniel 13:7) 
When Susanna left to walk in her husband's garden at midday,

(Daniel 13:8) 
the elders saw her enter and walk there. Driven by lust, their hearts burned for her.

(Daniel 13:9) 
They turned their gaze away.

(Daniel 13:10) 
After they withdrew, she entered the garden and walked there. It was hot, so she wanted to bathe in the garden.

(Daniel 13:11) 
There was a large container there. She opened it, wanting to bathe.

(Daniel 13:12) 
The two elders were hiding, watching her.

(Daniel 13:13) 
Susanna said, "Bring us oil and ointments, and close the doors of the garden so we can bathe."

(Daniel 13:14) 
They shouted, closed the doors of the garden, sent their servants away, and shut the doors.

(Daniel 13:15) 
When the servants had left, the two elders rose and rushed toward her.

(Daniel 13:16) 
They said to her, "The doors of the garden are closed, and no one sees us. We desire you; therefore, yield to us and be with us."

(Daniel 13:17) 
She said to them, "I will not do this. It is better for me to fall into your hands than to sin in the sight of the Lord."

(Daniel 13:18) 
So Susanna cried out in a loud voice, and the elders cried out against her.

(Daniel 13:19) 
Each of them ran off in his own direction.

(Daniel 13:20) 
One said to the other, "What is this that has happened?"

(Daniel 13:21) 
The elders returned and gathered against her, saying, "We caught Susanna, the daughter of Helcias and the wife of Joachim, walking in the garden with a young man, and we apprehended him. Since he refused to confess, we killed him."

(Daniel 13:22) 
They immediately said they had seen her with the young man, and this was their testimony.

(Daniel 13:23) 
In the morning, the assembly of the people was gathered, and the elders of the judges came with Susanna.

(Daniel 13:24) 
She was sent by her husband, her parents, and her servants. Susanna wept.

(Daniel 13:25) 
When she was in the sight of everyone, the elders said, "Send her away, and let us render judgment."

(Daniel 13:26) 
They said to her, "Tell us under what tree you caught them together."

(Daniel 13:27) 
She replied, "Under a mastic tree." And she said, "You have lied to your own detriment."

(Daniel 13:28) 
As they looked at each other, they said, "Tell us under what tree you caught them in conversation."

(Daniel 13:29) 
She said, "Under an holm oak." And she said, "You have lied, and you will not cease lying."

(Daniel 13:30) 
When all was said, everyone cried out and said, "Let her be killed!" Susanna cried out in a loud voice and wept because she was innocent.

(Daniel 13:31) 
Then Daniel stood up and said, "You sons of Israel are wicked, and you have rendered a false judgment against the daughter of Israel!"

(Daniel 13:32) 
All the people returned to him. He said, "You are foolish sons of Israel! Without judgment and without knowledge, have you condemned the daughter of Israel?"

(Daniel 13:33) 
Return to the judgment, for they have given false testimony against her."

(Daniel 13:34) 
Daniel, hastening, said, "Separate them, and let them not approach each other."

(Daniel 13:35) 
When they were separated, he called one of them and said to him, "O elder of wicked days, now your sins, which you committed before, have come to light,

(Daniel 13:36) 
judging false judgments, condemning the innocent, and acquitting the guilty, even though the Lord says, 'You shall not kill the innocent and the just.'"

(Daniel 13:37) 
Now then, if you saw her, tell us under what tree you saw them conversing together."

(Daniel 13:38) 
He replied, "Under an holm oak."

(Daniel 13:39) 
Then Daniel said, "You have lied to your own detriment! For behold, the angel of God, holding a sword, awaits you to destroy you."

(Daniel 13:40) 
And when he had removed him, he ordered the other to come. He said to him, "Seed of Canaan, not of Judah, a deceptive appearance, and let not error deceive you."

(Daniel 13:41) 
Why did you say you saw her walking with a young man, when you had lust for her?"

(Daniel 13:42) 
He replied, "Under a mastic tree."

(Daniel 13:43) 
Then Daniel said to him, "And you also have lied to your own detriment, for the angel of God awaits with a sword to cut you to pieces."

(Daniel 13:44) 
And the whole assembly cried out with a loud voice and blessed God, who saves those who hope in Him.

(Daniel 13:45) 
They rose against the two elders (because Daniel had convicted them of false testimony), and they did to them as they had wickedly planned.

(Daniel 13:46) 
They put them to death, and the innocent life was saved that day.

(Daniel 13:47) 
And Helcias and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, along with her husband Joachim, because no shameful thing had been found in her.

(Daniel 13:48) 
And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day forward.

(Daniel 14:1) 
And in the land was the prophet Habakkuk, and he took a meal of stew and a loaf of bread and carried it in a container to the harvesters in the field.

(Daniel 14:2) 
Now the dragon of Bel, as we were together, consumed all of the offerings that were given to him.

(Daniel 14:3) 
Therefore, Habakkuk said, “Lord, give me the stew and the bread, so I may give it to the harvesters.”

(Daniel 14:4) 
And an angel of the Lord grabbed Habakkuk by the hair of his head and carried him to Babylon, to the lion’s den, and with the force of his spirit, he placed him above the den.

(Daniel 14:5) 
Then Habakkuk spoke, “Habakkuk, give the meal to Habakkuk, whom you sent to Babylon.”

(Daniel 14:6) 
And Habakkuk gave Habakkuk the meal.

(Daniel 14:7) 
Bel and his priests, along with all the people, ate the offerings that were there.

(Daniel 14:8) 
But when they saw this, they cried out with a loud voice, “Great is Bel!”

(Daniel 14:9) 
But Daniel laughed and seized Bel, killing him and handing his priests over to Daniel’s power.

(Daniel 14:10) 
And he said, “Look, who is this? Do you see, Lord?”

(Daniel 14:11) 
And the king said: “Let them be brought before me, and I will determine who among them has done this.”

(Daniel 14:12) 
And when they were gathered and tested by the king, three hundred lying priests were found. He ordered them to be killed and gave Bel to Daniel’s power. And he destroyed him, and destroyed his temple.

(Daniel 14:13) 
In the same place was a great serpent, which the Babylonians worshipped.

(Daniel 14:14) 
And the king said to Daniel: “Do not say that this serpent is made of bronze? Look, it is alive; it eats and drinks; you cannot say that it is not a living god; therefore, adore him.”

(Daniel 14:15) 
And Daniel said, “I will worship my Lord God; because He is the living God; but this serpent is not a living God.”

(Daniel 14:16) 
Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair and cooked these things together; he made them into masses, and gave them to the serpent. The serpent burst.

(Daniel 14:17) 
And the Babylonians said, “King, because the serpent ate the offerings, Daniel killed the serpent.”

(Daniel 14:18) 
And when the king heard this, he was angry and handed Daniel over, and they gave him to the lions, and he remained there for six days.

(Daniel 14:19) 
And there were two prophets in Judea: one was Habakkuk, the other Daniel.

(Daniel 14:20) 
And the angel of the Lord took Habakkuk from Judea to Babylon and sent him into the lion’s den.

(Daniel 14:21) 
On the seventh day, the king came and saw Daniel sitting in the middle of the lions, and he worshiped and said, “You are great, Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you.”

(Daniel 14:22) 
And he brought him out of the lion’s den.

(Daniel 14:23) 
Now those who wanted to kill Daniel were given to the lions and were consumed immediately before them.

(Daniel 14:24) 
Then the king said, “Let all those who dwell in the entire land fear the God of Daniel, because He is the savior, performing signs and wonders on the earth.”

(Hosea 1:1) 
The Son's message was given to Hosea son of Beeri, during the reigns of kings of Judah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. It was also during the time of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.

(Hosea 1:2) 
This is the beginning of the Lord's message to Hosea. The Lord told Hosea: “Go, and take for yourself a wife who is a prostitute, and children born from her promiscuity. Because the land itself will become unfaithful, committing sins, abandoning its duties to the Lord.”

(Hosea 1:3) 
So Hosea went and married Gomer, daughter of Diblaim. She conceived and bore him a son.

(Hosea 1:4) 
And the Lord said, “Name him Jezreel, because soon I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed in Jezreel. I will end the kingdom of the house of Israel.”

(Hosea 1:5) 
And in that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.

(Hosea 1:6) 
She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-ruchamah, which means 'not pitied', because I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel. I will utterly forget them.”

(Hosea 1:7) 
But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God. I will not save them by means of bows, swords, warfare, horses, or riders.

(Hosea 1:8) 
After she had weaned Lo-ruchamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.

(Hosea 1:9) 
And the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi, which means 'not my people', because you are not my people, and I am not your God.”

(Hosea 1:10) 
Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where they were told, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'

(Hosea 1:11) 
The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint one leader and then leave the land. For a great day will come to Jezreel.

(Hosea 2:1) 
Hear the Word of the Lord, children of Israel! The Lord has a case against those who inhabit the land because there is no truth, there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land.

(Hosea 2:2) 
They swear falsely, they lie, murder, steal, and commit adultery. Violence and bloodshed are everywhere.

(Hosea 2:3) 
For these sins, the land will mourn, and everyone who lives there will grow weak. Even the beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the fish in the sea will be affected.

(Hosea 2:4) 
Nevertheless, let no one judge or accuse anyone, for my people are like those who are not judged.

(Hosea 2:5) 
My people will fall because they lack knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving me as a priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will forget your children.

(Hosea 2:6) 
The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame.

(Hosea 2:7) 
They eat the sin of my people and raise their souls to iniquity.

(Hosea 2:8) 
The priest will be like the people. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.

(Hosea 2:9) 
They will eat, but not be satisfied. They have committed whoredom, but they have not increased, because they have abandoned the Lord.

(Hosea 2:10) 
Whoredom, wine, and drunkenness take away the heart.

(Hosea 2:11) 
My people consult their wood, and their staff gives them oracles. For the spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have departed from their God to commit whoredom.

(Hosea 2:12) 
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth trees because their shade is good. Therefore, your daughters will commit whoredom, and your brides will commit adultery.

(Hosea 2:13) 
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your brides when they commit adultery, for the men themselves consort with prostitutes and sacrifice with cult prostitutes. A people without understanding will fall.

(Hosea 2:14) 
Though you, Israel, commit whoredom, let not Judah offend, nor enter Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, 'As the Lord lives.'

(Hosea 2:15) 
For Israel is like a stubborn heifer; now the Lord will pasture them like a lamb in an open place.

(Hosea 2:16) 
Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.

(Hosea 2:17) 
Their drink is gone; they have committed whoredom. Their rulers dearly love shame.

(Hosea 2:18) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 2:19) 
A wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 2:20) 
Say this to the house of Jacob, and to all the remnants of the house of Israel, who swear by the name of the Lord, and invoke the God of Israel, but not in truth or righteousness.

(Hosea 2:21) 
For they call themselves after the holy city, and glory in the God of Israel, but not in truth.

(Hosea 2:22) 
Therefore, I will be like a harlot to you, Israel. Don't go to Gilgal, don't go up to Beth-aven, and don't swear, 'As the Lord lives.'

(Hosea 2:23) 
For like a stubborn heifer, you have turned away from the Lord. Now he will pasture you like a lamb in an open place.

(Hosea 2:24) 
When their drinking is over, they commit whoredom, and their rulers dearly love shame. The shield of her protectors is shame.

(Hosea 2:25) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and she will be ashamed of her sacrifices.

(Hosea 3:1) 
And the Lord said to me: “Go again, and love a woman who is loved by a neighbor and is an adulteress. This is how the Lord loves the children of Israel, even though they are looking to other gods, and are fond of raisin cakes.”

(Hosea 3:2) 
So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver, a measure of barley, and a container of wine.

(Hosea 3:3) 
I said to her: “You will wait for me for many days. You will not be unfaithful, nor will you belong to any other man, and I will also wait for you.”

(Hosea 3:4) 
For the children of Israel will remain for many days without a king, and without a leader, and without sacrifices, and without an altar, and without the priestly vestments, and without household gods.

(Hosea 3:5) 
After this, the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God, and David their king. They will fear the Lord, and His goodness at the end of days.

(Hosea 4:1) 
Hear the word of the Lord, children of Israel, because the Lord has a case against those who live on the earth, because there is no truth, no mercy, and no knowledge of God in the land.

(Hosea 4:2) 
Lying, and deceit, and murder, and theft, and adultery have come to light, and bloodshed follows more bloodshed.

(Hosea 4:3) 
That is why the land will mourn, and everyone who lives in it will be weakened, with the wild animals of the field and the birds of the sky, and even the fish of the sea will disappear.

(Hosea 4:4) 
But let no one bring a charge, or accuse anyone: for my people are like those who have no knowledge.

(Hosea 4:5) 
Israel does not understand this: they have their implements made of wood. In their divination there is an arrow, and in their part they have a shield.

(Hosea 4:6) 
That is why my people will fail, because they have no knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you, so that you will not function as a priest for me; and because you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.

(Hosea 4:7) 
The more they have multiplied, the more they have sinned against me: I will change their glory into disgrace.

(Hosea 4:8) 
They will eat the sins of my people, and they will lift up their souls towards their iniquity.

(Hosea 4:9) 
It will be: like people, so also the priest: and I will visit upon him his ways, and I will give to him according to his works.

(Hosea 4:10) 
They will eat, and not be satisfied: they have committed fornication, and have not increased, because they have abandoned the Lord for wantonness.

(Hosea 4:11) 
Fornication, wine, and drunkenness take away the heart.

(Hosea 4:12) 
My people seek counsel from their wood, and their staff declares to them: for a spirit of fornication has seduced them, and they have committed fornication against their God.

(Hosea 4:13) 
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and they offer incense on the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the elm, because its shade is good: that is why your daughters commit fornication, and your brides commit adultery.

(Hosea 4:14) 
I will not punish your daughters when they commit fornication, or your brides when they commit adultery: because they themselves are involved with prostitutes, and with effeminate men, the undisciplined people sacrifice.

(Hosea 4:15) 
If you, Israel, commit fornication, let not Judah trespass; and let them not enter into Gilgal, and let them not go up to Beth-aven, nor swear “As the Lord lives.”

(Hosea 4:16) 
Because Israel is wanton, like a heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in the open space.

(Hosea 4:17) 
Ephraim has been associated with idols: let her be.

(Hosea 4:18) 
Their drinking is polluted, they are exhausted: they have committed fornication, they have loved it, they have despised their shield.

(Hosea 4:19) 
The wind has wrapped her in its wings, and they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.

(Hosea 5:1) 
Listen to this, priests. Pay attention, house of Israel! Give ear, you in the royal household! The judgment is against you. You are caught in a trap at Mizpah, and a net spread over Tabor.

(Hosea 5:2) 
The rebels of Israel have gone deep into sin. But I know them all.

(Hosea 5:3) 
I know Ephraim. Israel is not hidden from Me. Now, Ephraim, you have committed spiritual adultery. Israel is corrupted.

(Hosea 5:4) 
They will not turn from their ways, to turn back to their God, because the spirit of spiritual adultery is within them, and they do not know the Lord.

(Hosea 5:5) 
The pride of Israel condemns them. Israel and Ephraim will fall because of their sin. Judah will also fall.

(Hosea 5:6) 
They will go to seek the Lord with their flocks and herds, but they will not find Him, because He has departed from them.

(Hosea 5:7) 
They have acted against the Lord, because they have had children with other gods. Now, the new moon with their feasts will consume them.

(Hosea 5:8) 
Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Cry out in Beth-Aven! Fear the coming judgment, O Benjamin!

(Hosea 5:9) 
Ephraim will be made desolate in the day of rebuke. I have made known the truth among the tribes of Israel, like a root is their corruption.

(Hosea 5:10) 
The leaders of Judah have become like those who move boundary stones, so I will pour out My wrath on them like water.

(Hosea 5:11) 
Ephraim is oppressed and crushed by judgment, because they have begun to walk after idols.

(Hosea 5:12) 
I will be like a moth to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah.

(Hosea 5:13) 
Ephraim sees its sickness, and Judah sees its wounds. Then Ephraim goes to Assyria and sends to King Jareb, but he cannot heal you nor cure your wounds.

(Hosea 5:14) 
I will be like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, yes I, will tear them to pieces and then I will depart. There is no one to save them.

(Hosea 5:15) 
They will go back to their own place, and will not return until they acknowledge their sin and failure. In their suffering, they will seek My face.

(Hosea 6:1) 
Come, and let’s return to the Lord, because He wounds us, and He will heal us. He strikes, and He will cure us.

(Hosea 6:2) 
After two days, He will give us life. On the third day, He will raise us up, and we will live in His presence.

(Hosea 6:3) 
Let us strive to know the Lord. As surely as the dawn appears, so will He come forth. He will come to us like the rain—the early and the late rain to the earth.

(Hosea 6:4) 
What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love for Me is like the morning clouds, and like the morning dew that disappears.

(Hosea 6:5) 
Therefore, I hacked them to pieces by the prophets; I killed them with the words of My mouth, and the judgment of God is like the light that goes forth.

(Hosea 6:6) 
For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

(Hosea 6:7) 
But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant. There, they despised Me.

(Hosea 6:8) 
Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with blood.

(Hosea 6:9) 
They act like a band of robbers, lying in wait on the road. They strike.

(Hosea 6:10) 
In the house of Israel, I saw a horrible thing. There are adulteries with Ephraim; Israel is defiled.

(Hosea 6:11) 
Also, Judah, a harvest is appointed for you when I return the captivity of My people.

(Hosea 7:1) 
When I, the Lord, wanted to heal Israel, I found the sins of Ephraim—the northern kingdom—and the wickedness of Samaria—its capital city. For they have lied to me and turned away from me, and a thief breaks into a house to steal.

(Hosea 7:2) 
They don’t realize that I know all their evil actions. They think their wicked deeds have hidden them from me. These actions of theirs are right in front of my face.

(Hosea 7:3) 
They make their king happy with their wicked deeds, and their leaders happy with their schemes and lies.

(Hosea 7:4) 
All of them are unfaithful, like a baker’s oven that is heated. The baker stops stirring the dough after he mixes in the ingredients, and then he waits for the dough to rise.

(Hosea 7:5) 
In the day of our king, the leaders became drunk with wine and made a mess.

(Hosea 7:6) 
Their hearts are like a heated oven, and they plan all night long. In the morning, it is as if the oven is on fire.

(Hosea 7:7) 
All of them are hot like an oven, and they have consumed their judges and their kings. None of them call on me.

(Hosea 7:8) 
Ephraim has mingled himself among the nations. Ephraim is now like a cake that is not flipped on the griddle.

(Hosea 7:9) 
Foreigners have drained his strength. He does not know it. Gray hairs are sprinkled on him, but he does not know it.

(Hosea 7:10) 
Israel’s pride testifies against him. Yet they have not returned to the Lord their God. They have not sought him in all these things.

(Hosea 7:11) 
Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without a heart. They call to Egypt, and they go to Assyria.

(Hosea 7:12) 
When they go there, I will spread my net over them. I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will punish them as their community has heard.

(Hosea 7:13) 
Woe to them, for they have fled from me! Destruction to them, because they have transgressed against me. Although I have redeemed them, they have spoken lies against me.

(Hosea 7:14) 
They did not cry out to me with their hearts, but they wailed on their beds. They have separated themselves from me, but they will gather grain and wine.

(Hosea 7:15) 
Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, they plot evil against me.

(Hosea 7:16) 
They turned, but not to the Most High. They have become like a faulty bow. They will fall by the sword because of the rage of their tongues. They will become a joke in the land of Egypt.

(Hosea 8:1) 
Sound the trumpet! Like an eagle over the house of the Lord, because they have broken my covenant and defied my law.

(Hosea 8:2) 
They will cry out to me: 'My God, we know you, Israel.'

(Hosea 8:3) 
Israel has rejected what is good; now, an enemy will chase after him.

(Hosea 8:4) 
They set up their own rulers, not those I chose. They made idols from their silver and gold, which will destroy them.

(Hosea 8:5) 
Cast out your calf, Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be unable to be cleansed?

(Hosea 8:6) 
Because it is from Israel, this calf. A craftsman made it, but it is not God. It will be broken.

(Hosea 8:7) 
They sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk and it will not produce grain. If it did, strangers would devour it.

(Hosea 8:8) 
Israel is being destroyed. Now he is among the nations like a vessel with no purpose.

(Hosea 8:9) 
For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.

(Hosea 8:10) 
Indeed, they have hired lovers among the nations. Now, I will gather them, and they will rest a little from the burden of the king and the princes.

(Hosea 8:11) 
Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, altars have become for him as a way to sin.

(Hosea 8:12) 
I wrote many things from my law for him, but they were considered as foreign.

(Hosea 8:13) 
They offer sacrifices, and eat the flesh, but it is not pleasing to the Lord. Now, He will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. They will return to Egypt.

(Hosea 8:14) 
And Israel will forget his maker, and will build palaces. And he will multiply altars for sinning.

(Hosea 8:15) 
I will send fire into his cities, and it will devour his palaces.

(Hosea 9:1) 
Do not be like the pagans, O Israel. Because you committed fornication from God. You loved the gifts that came from others more than God, who provides everything.

(Hosea 9:2) 
Neither the harvest fields nor the wine will give what you think. The wine will deceive you.

(Hosea 9:3) 
They will not live in the land of the Lord. Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat impure food.

(Hosea 9:4) 
They will not offer wine to the Lord, and it will not please Him. Like the bread of mourning, all those who eat it will be defiled, because their bread is for themselves.

(Hosea 9:5) 
What will you do on the feast day, and on the day of the festival of the Lord?

(Hosea 9:6) 
Look, because they have left, they will be ravaged. Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them. The most prized of their possessions, will become nettles. Thorns will be in their tabernacles.

(Hosea 9:7) 
The days of visitation have come, the days of retribution have come. Israel will know this. The prophet is a fool, and is crazy in his own spirit, because of the multitude of your iniquities, and the great turning away from God.

(Hosea 9:8) 
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: a prophet is a snare for a bird-catcher in all his ways, and there is a turning away from the house of God.

(Hosea 9:9) 
They have sinned even more deeply than in the days of Gibeah: He will remember their iniquity and visit their sins.

(Hosea 9:10) 
I found Israel as the grapes in the desert. I saw your fathers like the first fruits of the fig tree in their early season: They went in to Baal-phegor, and were separated in him, and became abominable as they loved.

(Hosea 9:11) 
Ephraim will fly away like a bird: from glory, from offspring, from the womb, and from conception.

(Hosea 9:12) 
And even if they raise their sons, I will take them away without a man. Woe to them when I depart from them.

(Hosea 9:13) 
Ephraim, like I see, is planted in Tyre in beauty: and Ephraim will bring forth his sons to be killed.

(Hosea 9:14) 
Give them, O Lord: what will you give? Give them a womb without conception.

(Hosea 9:15) 
All their wickedness is at Gilgal, because I hate them there: because of the evil of their works I will cast them from my house. I will not continue to love them, all their princes are rebellious.

(Hosea 9:16) 
Ephraim is struck, their root has withered, they will not bear fruit. And if they conceive, I will kill their most desired children.

(Hosea 9:17) 
My God will cast them away, because they did not hear Him: and they will wander among the gentiles.

(Hosea 10:1) 
Israel was like a special vineyard, producing valuable grain for itself. Because of its abundance of crops, it multiplied altars. Because of the fertility of its land, it made statues to pagan gods.

(Hosea 10:2) 
Their hearts are divided and weakened. They will soon be destroyed. God Himself will smash their idols to pieces; their idol-statues will be shattered.

(Hosea 10:3) 
For now they are saying: "We have no king, because we have no fear of the Lord." And what can a king do for us now?

(Hosea 10:4) 
They speak wickedness, making false promises, and entering into treaties with oaths. Therefore, judgment will spring up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.

(Hosea 10:5) 
The people of Israel will be terrified by the false idols of Beth-aven. The people and their priests will mourn and wail because the glory of Israel has been exiled.

(Hosea 10:6) 
Israel and its priests will also be carried away as tribute to the king of Assyria. Israel and Ephraim will be ashamed of their own plans.

(Hosea 10:7) 
Samaria will be destroyed because it has rebelled against its God. The people will fall by the sword; their little children will be crushed, and the pregnant women will be ripped open.

(Hosea 10:8) 
Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have fallen because of your sin.

(Hosea 10:9) 
Prepare your words, and return to the Lord. Say to Him, "Forgive all our wickedness, and receive us in Your goodness, and we will give You our own thanks."

(Hosea 10:10) 
Assyria will not save us. We will not ride on horses. We will no longer say to the works of our hands, "You are our gods," because in You, O Lord, the orphan finds mercy.

(Hosea 10:11) 
I will heal their wounds. I will love them freely, for My anger has turned away from them.

(Hosea 10:12) 
I will be like the morning dew. Israel will sprout like a lily and send out its roots like the trees of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:13) 
Its branches will spread out, and its glory will be like the olive tree. It will have a pleasant aroma like the cedars of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:14) 
Those who dwell in its shadow will return; they will revive and flourish like the grain; they will grow like a vine. Their remembrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.

(Hosea 10:15) 
Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and watch over him. I am like a flourishing cypress tree; your fruit comes from Me.

(Hosea 11:1) 
When Israel was a child, I loved him: and I called my son out of Egypt.

(Hosea 11:2) 
The more I called them, the more they went away from me: they sacrificed to the Baals, and offered incense to carved images.

(Hosea 11:3) 
Yet I myself was like a father to Ephraim: I carried them on my arm, and they did not realize that I would be there for them.

(Hosea 11:4) 
I drew them with ties of men, with bonds of love: and I was to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws: and I cared for them.

(Hosea 11:5) 
They shall not return to the land of Egypt: and Assur himself shall be their master, because they would not turn back to Me.

(Hosea 11:6) 
The sword will rage in his cities, and will consume his bars, and devour them because of their wickedness.

(Hosea 11:7) 
And my people shall hang in suspense as they return to Me: and if he calls upon Me, I will not exalt them at the same time.

(Hosea 11:8) 
How shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall I protect you, Israel? How shall I give you up as Adama? Shall I make you like Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, and my repentance is disturbed at once.

(Hosea 11:9) 
I will not execute the wrath of my anger: I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man: the Holy One in your midst, and I will not enter the city.

(Hosea 11:10) 
The Lord will walk after him: he shall roar like a lion, he shall roar: and the children of the sea shall tremble.

(Hosea 11:11) 
And they shall fly away like a bird out of Egypt: and like a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will place them in their houses, says the Lord.

(Hosea 11:12) 
Ephraim has surrounded Me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah is still walking with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.

(Hosea 12:1) 
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, and the house of Israel surrounds Me with deceit. But now, Judah still trusts God, and remains faithful to the Holy Ones.

(Hosea 12:2) 
Ephraim seeks emptiness, and follows the desert wind: all day long he multiplies lies and violence. He has also made a covenant with the Assyrians, and carries oil to Egypt.

(Hosea 12:3) 
Therefore, the Lord will contend with Israel in Judah, and will visit Jacob, and will repay him according to his ways and deeds.

(Hosea 12:4) 
In the womb, he supplanted his brother, and he had power with God.

(Hosea 12:5) 
He had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication to him. At Bethel, he found Him, and there He spoke with us.

(Hosea 12:6) 
The Lord God of hosts, the Lord is His memorial.

(Hosea 12:7) 
So you, return to your God: keep mercy and judgment, and hope in your God always.

(Hosea 12:8) 
Canaan has a fraudulent balance in his hand, and desires to defraud.

(Hosea 12:9) 
And Ephraim said: "Surely I have become rich, I have found for myself rest: all my works will not discover in me the iniquity which I have done."

(Hosea 12:10) 
But I am the Lord your God, from the land of Egypt: I will yet make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the feast.

(Hosea 12:11) 
And I have spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and I have been likened by the hands of the prophets.

(Hosea 12:12) 
If Gilead is iniquity, truly they were in vain: in Gilgal they sacrificed to bulls: their altars also are as heaps in the furrows of the field.

(Hosea 12:13) 
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and he was nourished for a wife.

(Hosea 12:14) 
And the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet, and by a prophet he was kept.

(Hosea 12:15) 
Ephraim provoked in bitterness: his blood will be left behind, and his ignominy will be restored to him.

(Hosea 13:1) 
Ephraim was feared when he spoke, a leader in Israel, but he was already dead to God, and addicted to the sin of Baal.

(Hosea 13:2) 
And now they make their sins even worse, manufacturing idols of silver, works of craftsmen. They tell these idols: “Sacrifice people!”—men who kiss the idols.

(Hosea 13:3) 
Therefore, they will become like morning mist, like passing morning dew, like dust blown from the threshing floor, and like smoke from a chimney.

(Hosea 13:4) 
Yet I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no other gods besides Me, for there is no savior except Me.

(Hosea 13:5) 
I knew you in the desert, in the land of solitude.

(Hosea 13:6) 
When they had fed, their hearts grew proud, and they forgot Me.

(Hosea 13:7) 
So I became like a lion to them, like a leopard on the road of the Assyrians.

(Hosea 13:8) 
I will meet them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and I will tear open their hearts. There I will devour them like a lion; wild beasts will tear them apart.

(Hosea 13:9) 
Israel, you are destroyed because you are against Me, against your help.

(Hosea 13:10) 
Where is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? And where are your judges, of whom you said, “Give me a king and princes”?

(Hosea 13:11) 
I gave you a king in My anger, and I took him away in My wrath.

(Hosea 13:12) 
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound, his sin is stored up.

(Hosea 13:13) 
The pangs of childbirth will come to him, but he is a foolish son. For it is not yet time to open the womb.

(Hosea 13:14) 
I will rescue them from the power of the grave. I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O hell, is your destruction? Compassion is hidden from My eyes.

(Hosea 13:15) 
Though he flourishes among the brothers, an east wind will come, the wind of the Lord, rising from the desert. It will come like a whirlwind from His ways.

(Hosea 13:16) 
The land will become desolate. All of its fruit will dry up. All the precious vessels will be destroyed.

(Hosea 14:1) 
Israel, come back to the Lord your God, because you fell into sin.

(Hosea 14:2) 
Take these words to pray with, and come back to the Lord. Say to Him: “Take away all iniquity, and receive what is good, and we will give you the sacrifices of our lips.”

(Hosea 14:3) 
Assyria will not save us. We will not depend on horses. We will no longer say, ‘These idols are our gods, made by our hands,’ because in You, the orphan is shown mercy.

(Hosea 14:4) 
I will heal their wounds and I will love them of my own accord, because my anger is turned away from them.

(Hosea 14:5) 
I will be like the morning dew to Israel. They will flourish like the lily, and they will send down their roots like the cedars of Lebanon.

(Hosea 14:6) 
His branches will spread out, and his glory will be like an olive tree, and his scent will be like the cedars of Lebanon.

(Hosea 14:7) 
Those who live in the shadow of the righteous will return. They will live by the wheat, and they will flourish like the vine. Their fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.

(Hosea 14:8) 
Ephraim, what do I have to do with idols anymore? I will answer them and look after them. I will be like a green cypress tree, and from me, your fruit will be found.

(Hosea 14:9) 
Who is wise and will understand these things? Who is prudent and will know these things? The ways of the Lord are just, and the righteous will walk in them. But the wicked will stumble and fall.

(Joel 1:1) 
The following is the word of the Lord, which came to Joel, the son of Fathuël.

(Joel 1:2) 
Listen to this, you elders, and hear with your ears, all inhabitants of the earth: Has anything like this happened in your time, or in the time of your ancestors?

(Joel 1:3) 
Tell your children this, and let your children tell their children, and their children tell the next generation.

(Joel 1:4) 
What the locusts left, the swarming locusts ate. What the swarming locusts left, the grasshoppers ate, and what the grasshoppers left, the mildew ate.

(Joel 1:5) 
Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! And wail, all you who drink wine in sweetness, because it is taken away from your mouth.

(Joel 1:6) 
For a nation has come up upon my land, strong and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its molar teeth are those of a lioness.

(Joel 1:7) 
It has made my vineyard a desolation, and my fig tree a ruin. It has stripped it bare, and cast it away; its branches are despised.

(Joel 1:8) 
Lament like a virgin, girded with sackcloth, for the husband of her youth.

(Joel 1:9) 
The sacrifice and the libation are cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the ministers of the Lord, are in mourning.

(Joel 1:10) 
The fields are wasted, the ground is in mourning, because the wheat is ruined, the wine is dried up, the oil is gone.

(Joel 1:11) 
The farmers are ashamed; the vinedressers wail over the wheat and the barley, for the harvest of the field has perished.

(Joel 1:12) 
The vine has dried up, and the fig tree is broken. The pomegranate, the palm, the apple, and all the trees of the field have withered; because joy has failed from the sons of men.

(Joel 1:13) 
Gird yourselves and lament, priests; wail, ministers of the altar. Go in, lie in sackcloth, ministers of my God, because the sacrifice and the libation are cut off from the house of your God.

(Joel 1:14) 
Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly; gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of your God, and cry out to the Lord.

(Joel 1:15) 
Alas for the day, because the day of the Lord is near, and it will come like a desolation from the Almighty.

(Joel 1:16) 
Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes, joy and exultation from the house of our God?

(Joel 1:17) 
The seeds have withered under the clods; the barns have been laid waste; because there is no grain.

(Joel 1:18) 
How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are moaning, because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are scattered.

(Joel 1:19) 
To you, Lord, I will cry out, because fire has devoured the beauty of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the region.

(Joel 1:20) 
Even the beasts of the field long for you, because the torrent of waters is dried up, and fire has devoured the beauty of the wilderness.

(Joel 2:1) 
Sound the trumpet in Zion! Give a warning cry on My holy mountain! Let all who live on earth tremble, because the day of the Lord is coming soon.

(Joel 2:2) 
The day of darkness, of storm, of clouds, and of shadows is approaching! Like the dawn expanding on the mountains, there comes a great and mighty people the likes of which has never been, nor will there be again for generations to come.

(Joel 2:3) 
Ahead of them is a devouring fire, and behind them is a blazing flame. The land before them is as the Garden of Eden, and behind them, a desolate wasteland. Nothing escapes them.

(Joel 2:4) 
They look like horses, and they run like warriors on horseback.

(Joel 2:5) 
Like the sound of chariots, they rush over the mountaintops. Like the crackling of a fire devouring the stubble, they are a mighty people prepared for battle.

(Joel 2:6) 
Nations tremble at their approach; their faces are black like those of a boiling pot.

(Joel 2:7) 
They charge like warriors. Each goes straight ahead. They don’t get in each other’s way.

(Joel 2:8) 
They don't jostle one another; each marches straight ahead. They burst through windows like thieves.

(Joel 2:9) 
They storm the city; they run along the wall; they climb into the houses, entering like a thief through the windows.

(Joel 2:10) 
The earth quakes before them, and the sky trembles. The sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine.

(Joel 2:11) 
The Lord is giving his voice to His great army. The Lord's day is very great and exceedingly terrible. Who can endure it?

(Joel 2:12) 
So now, says the Lord, “Turn back to Me with all your heart, and fast, and weep, and mourn.

(Joel 2:13) 
Tear your hearts, not your clothes; return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love; and He relents over disaster.

(Joel 2:14) 
Who knows whether He will relent and leave behind Him a blessing, a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?

(Joel 2:15) 
Sound the trumpet in Zion! Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly.

(Joel 2:16) 
Gather the people, consecrate the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber.

(Joel 2:17) 
Between the porch and the altar, let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep. Let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord, and give not Your heritage to reproach, that the nations may rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”

(Joel 2:18) 
Then the Lord became jealous for His land and had pity on His people.

(Joel 2:19) 
The Lord answered His people: “Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.

(Joel 2:20) 
I will remove the northern army far from you, and drive it into a barren and desolate land, its front to the eastern sea and its rear to the western sea. And its stench will rise, and its foul odor will go up, for it has done great things.”

(Joel 2:21) 
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord has done great things!

(Joel 2:22) 
Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their strength.

(Joel 2:23) 
And children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your God! For He has given you the early rain for your vindication; and He will pour down for you the rain, both the early and the late.

(Joel 2:24) 
The threshing floors shall be full of grain; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

(Joel 2:25) 
“I will restore the years that the locust has eaten—the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, My great army, which I sent among you.

(Joel 2:26) 
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never again be put to shame.

(Joel 2:27) 
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God and there is no other. And My people shall never again be put to shame.

(Joel 2:28) 
“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.

(Joel 2:29) 
Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out My Spirit.

(Joel 2:30) 
“And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.

(Joel 2:31) 
The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.

(Joel 2:32) 
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.

(Joel 3:1) 
For, in those days, and at that time, I will restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem,

(Joel 3:2) 
I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of Josaphat. There I will judge them for what they did to My people and My inheritance, Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, and for dividing My land.

(Joel 3:3) 
They cast lots for My people, and gave a boy for a prostitute, and a girl for wine, so that they might drink.

(Joel 3:4) 
And what are you doing, Tyre, and Sidon, and all the territories of the Philistines? Are you trying to take My works from Me? Or what are you doing to Me?

(Joel 3:5) 
If you do these things, I will quickly and swiftly bring your actions down upon your own heads.

(Joel 3:6) 
You have taken My silver and gold, and have brought My precious and beautiful things into your temples.

(Joel 3:7) 
You have sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their territory.

(Joel 3:8) 
Behold, I will stir them up from the place where you have sold them, and I will return your retribution on your own heads.

(Joel 3:9) 
I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation, because the Lord has spoken.

(Joel 3:10) 
Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the soldiers advance and come forward!

(Joel 3:11) 
Beat your plowshares into swords and your spears into sickles. Let the weak say, “I am strong.”

(Joel 3:12) 
Hurry and come, all you nations from every side, and gather there; there the Lord will gather His mighty ones.

(Joel 3:13) 
Let the nations go down to the valley of Josaphat, because there I will sit to judge all the nations from every side.

(Joel 3:14) 
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread the winepress, for it is full; the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.

(Joel 3:15) 
Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of judgment! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of judgment.

(Joel 3:16) 
The sun and moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their brilliance.

(Joel 3:17) 
The Lord will roar from Zion, and give His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will shake, and the Lord will be the hope of His people and the strength of the children of Israel.

(Joel 3:18) 
And you will know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy, and strangers will no longer pass through it.

(Joel 3:19) 
And in that day, the mountains will drip with sweetness, and the hills will flow with milk and honey, and all the streams of Judah will flow with water. A fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, and will water the torrent of thorns.

(Joel 3:20) 
Egypt will become a desolation, and Edom a desert wasteland, because they did evil to the sons of Judah and shed innocent blood in their land.

(Joel 3:21) 
But I will avenge their blood, and will not hold them guiltless, and the Lord will dwell in Zion.

(Amos 1:1) 
These are the words of Amos, who was a shepherd from Tekoa. He saw visions about Jerusalem during the reign of King Uzziah of Judah and during the reign of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel. This happened two years before the earthquake.

(Amos 1:2) 
Amos said: “The Lord will roar from Zion, and He will make His voice heard from Jerusalem, so the beautiful pastures will mourn, and the top of Mount Carmel will dry up.”

(Amos 1:3) 
The Lord says: “For the three transgressions of Damascus and for the four, I will not relent; because they have threshed Gilead with iron sledges.

(Amos 1:4) 
“So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.

(Amos 1:5) 
“I will break the gate of Damascus. And I will destroy the one who rules from the valley of Aven, the one who holds the scepter from the house of Eden. The people of Aram will be exiled, along with the remnant of the Israelites,” says the Lord.

(Amos 1:6) 
The Lord says: “For the three transgressions of Gaza and for the four, I will not relent; because they took captives and deported them to Edom.”

(Amos 1:7) 
“So I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, and it will consume its fortresses.

(Amos 1:8) 
“I will destroy the one who rules from Ashdod, and the one who holds the scepter from Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,” says the Lord God.

(Amos 1:9) 
The Lord says: “For the three transgressions of Tyre and for the four, I will not relent; because they delivered up an entire population of captives to Edom.

(Amos 1:10) 
“So I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour its fortresses.

(Amos 1:11) 
The Lord says: “For the three transgressions of Edom and for the four, I will not relent; because he pursued his brother with the sword and cast off all pity, and his anger tore at all that was good, and he kept his wrath forever.

(Amos 1:12) 
“So I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the fortresses of Bozrah.

(Amos 1:13) 
The Lord says: “For the three transgressions of the Ammonites and for the four, I will not relent; because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.

(Amos 1:14) 
“So I will kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its fortresses, with shouting on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the tempest.

(Amos 1:15) 
“And their king will go into exile, along with his princes,” says the Lord.

(Amos 2:1) 
The Lord says this: "Moab has committed three crimes, and I will not turn away from punishing them, for they have desecrated the bones of the king of Edom by burning them to ashes.

(Amos 2:2) 
So, I will send fire against Moab that will consume its fortresses, and Moab will die in battle, with the shouts and blare of the war horn.

(Amos 2:3) 
I will destroy their leaders, and I will kill their rulers with them, says the Lord.

(Amos 2:4) 
The Lord says: "Judah has committed three crimes, and I will not turn away from punishing them, because they have rejected the law of the Lord, and have not kept His commandments. Their idols have deceived them, and they followed the same sinful paths as their ancestors.

(Amos 2:5) 
So I will send fire against Judah, and it will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.

(Amos 2:6) 
The Lord says: "Israel has committed three crimes, and I will not turn away from punishing them, for they have sold the innocent for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes. They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth.

(Amos 2:7) 
They oppress the poor, and they turn away from the needs of the humble. Fathers and sons exploit young women, which desecrates My holy Name.

(Amos 2:8) 
They take pledges of clothing, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.

(Amos 2:9) 
I destroyed the Amorites before them, although they were as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaks.

(Amos 2:10) 
I destroyed their fruit above, and their roots below.

(Amos 2:11) 
I brought you out of the land of Egypt, and I led you through the desert for forty years, so that you might possess the land of the Amorites.

(Amos 2:12) 
I raised up prophets from among your own sons, and I raised up Nazarites from among your young men. Isn't that the truth, children of Israel? says the Lord.

(Amos 2:13) 
But you made the Nazarites drink wine, and you commanded your prophets, saying, "Do not prophesy."

(Amos 2:14) 
I will press you down, as a cart presses down the sheaves of grain after the harvest. No swift runner will escape, the strong will not retain their strength, and the brave will not save their lives.

(Amos 2:15) 
The archer will not stand his ground, the swift of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.

(Amos 2:16) 
On that day, even the bravest of warriors will flee in terror, says the Lord. I will multiply those who are wicked.

(Amos 3:1) 
Hear this word which I speak against you, children of Israel, against the entire family I brought out of the land of Egypt, saying:

(Amos 3:2) 
“I have known only you of all the families of the earth. Therefore, I will visit against you all your iniquities.”

(Amos 3:3) 
If two walk together, unless they have agreed?

(Amos 3:4) 
Will a lion roar in the forest if it doesn't have prey? Will a young lion give its cry in its den if it has captured nothing?

(Amos 3:5) 
Does a bird fall into a snare on the earth without cause? Is the snare taken up from the earth before it has caught something?

(Amos 3:6) 
If a trumpet sounds in a city, will the people not be afraid? If there is evil in a city, hasn't the Lord done it?

(Amos 3:7) 
Indeed, the Lord God does nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants, the prophets.

(Amos 3:8) 
A lion roars, who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who will not prophesy?

(Amos 3:9) 
Proclaim this against the house of Jacob and to all the remaining members of the house of Israel: You who carry on, you who are like the high places, and you who practice iniquity.

(Amos 3:10) 
You hate the one who reproves in the gate, and you detest the one who speaks perfectly.

(Amos 3:11) 
Therefore, because you trample on the poor, and take a tribute of grain from them, you have built houses of squared stones, but you will not live in them; you have planted precious vineyards, but you will not drink wine from them.

(Amos 3:12) 
For I know your many crimes and your strong sins: hating the just, taking a bribe, and oppressing the poor in the gate.

(Amos 3:13) 
Therefore, the wise man will keep silent at that time, because it is a bad time.

(Amos 3:14) 
Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the Lord God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.

(Amos 3:15) 
Hate evil and love good, and establish judgment in the gate; perhaps the Lord God of hosts will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.

(Amos 3:16) 
Therefore, the Lord God of hosts, the Lord, says this: There will be wailing in the streets, and in all the roads they will say, “Woe, woe!” They will call the farmer to mourning, and those who know how to wail to lament.

(Amos 3:17) 
And there will be wailing in all the vineyards, because I will pass through the midst of you, says the Lord.

(Amos 3:18) 
Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord! Why is this to you? The day of the Lord is darkness and not light.

(Amos 3:19) 
It is like a man who flees from a lion, and a bear meets him; and he goes into a house and rests his hand on the wall, and a serpent strikes him.

(Amos 3:20) 
Surely the day of the Lord will be darkness and not light? It will be gloom and not splendor in it?

(Amos 3:21) 
I hate and I have rejected your festivals; and I will not smell your assemblies.

(Amos 3:22) 
Because if you offer me holocausts and your gifts, I will not receive them, and I will not look upon the peace offerings of your fat beasts.

(Amos 3:23) 
Take away from me the sound of your songs; I will not hear the song of your psaltery.

(Amos 3:24) 
But let judgment flow like water, and justice like a mighty torrent.

(Amos 3:25) 
Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, house of Israel?

(Amos 3:26) 
And you carried the tabernacle of your Moloch and the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.

(Amos 3:27) 
And I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus, says the Lord, whose name is the God of hosts.

(Amos 4:1) 
Listen to this, you wealthy women of Samaria, who oppress the poor, and crush the needy, who say to your husbands, “Bring us wine!”

(Amos 4:2) 
The Lord swears by His holiness, “Behold, the days are coming upon you, when they shall take you away with hooks, and what is left of you with fishhooks.”

(Amos 4:3) 
You shall go out through breaches in the walls, each one straight ahead, and you will be cast into the Hermon mountain,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:4) 
Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and multiply transgression! Offer your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes every three days.

(Amos 4:5) 
Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim it, and announce the offerings of freewill. For this is what you love, children of Israel!” says the Lord God.

(Amos 4:6) 
I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, and yet you have not returned to Me,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:7) 
And I also withheld the rain from you when there were still three months to the harvest. I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One part was rained upon, and the part on which it did not rain withered.

(Amos 4:8) 
So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied, and yet you have not returned to Me,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:9) 
I smote you with a burning wind and blight. Your gardens and your vineyards and your olive orchards the locust consumed, and yet you have not returned to Me,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:10) 
I sent among you pestilence after the manner of Egypt. I slew your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses, and I made the stench of your camps come up to your nostrils, and yet you have not returned to Me,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:11) 
I overthrew some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a brand plucked from the burning, and yet you have not returned to Me,” says the Lord.

(Amos 4:12) 
Therefore, I will do this to you, O Israel; and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.

(Amos 4:13) 
For behold, He who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what his thoughts are, who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth—the Lord, the God of hosts, is His name.

(Amos 5:1) 
Hear this word, because I am mourning over you, people of Israel.

(Amos 5:2) 
Israel has fallen and will not rise again.

(Amos 5:3) 
Because of this, God says, “The city that once provided a thousand soldiers will have only a hundred left. And the city that had a hundred soldiers will have only ten left, O people of Israel.”

(Amos 5:4) 
For God says to the people of Israel, “Seek Me, and you will live.

(Amos 5:5) 
Don’t go to Bethel. Don’t enter Gilgal, nor travel to Beersheba. Gilgal will become a ruin, and Bethel will be stripped of glory.

(Amos 5:6) 
Seek God so that you may live, or else He will strike the house of Joseph like a fire, and it will consume everything, and there will be no one to extinguish it in Bethel.

(Amos 5:7) 
You change the meaning of justice, making it bitter like wormwood, and you throw righteousness to the ground,

(Amos 5:8) 
You make the stars and the constellations, and you turn the shadow of death into morning, and the day into a dark night. You call for the waters of the sea, and pour them out over the surface of the earth.

(Amos 5:9) 
You bring ruin on the strong, and ruin will come upon the mighty.

(Amos 5:10) 
You hate those who rebuke evil at the gate, and you despise those who speak the truth.

(Amos 5:11) 
Because you trample the poor, and collect grain from them, you have built houses of stone, but you will not live in them; you have planted vineyards, but you will not drink their wine.

(Amos 5:12) 
For I know your many sins and the strength of your transgressions: you are enemies of the righteous, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor at the gate.

(Amos 5:13) 
So at this time, the wise will be silent because it is an evil time.

(Amos 5:14) 
Seek good, not evil, so that you may live. Then God will be with you, just as you say He is.

(Amos 5:15) 
I hate and reject your feasts. I will not receive the scent of your solemn assemblies.

(Amos 5:16) 
Even if you offer Me burnt offerings and gifts, I will not accept them; nor will I look at the peace offerings of your fattened animals.

(Amos 5:17) 
Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the music of your harps.

(Amos 5:18) 
But let judgment flow like water, and justice like a mighty river.

(Amos 5:19) 
O people of Israel, did you offer sacrifices and offerings to Me in the desert for forty years?

(Amos 5:20) 
You carried the tent of your god Moloch and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.

(Amos 5:21) 
So I will send you into exile beyond Damascus, God says. God of Hosts is His name.

(Amos 5:22) 
Woe to those who are so confident in the mountain of Samaria, the strength of the head of the nations, to whom the people of Israel come.

(Amos 5:23) 
Go to Calneh and see it, and then go to Hamath the great, and then descend to Gath of the Philistines. Are these kingdoms better than yours? Is their territory wider than yours?

(Amos 5:24) 
You separate yourselves for the day of evil, and you come to the throne on the Sabbath days.

(Amos 5:25) 
You sleep on beds of ivory and lounge on your couches. You eat the lambs from the flock and the calves from the midst of the herd.

(Amos 5:26) 
You sing along with the sound of the instruments, and you think of yourselves as one great nation, eating the best parts of the calves.

(Amos 5:27) 
Therefore, now you will be the first to be led away as captives, and the gatherings of revelers will be taken away.

(Amos 6:1) 
Woe to those who live carelessly in Zion and think they are safe on the mountain of Samaria! You are the leaders of the most important families and clans, the men of renown, and you consider yourselves to be the leaders of Israel.

(Amos 6:2) 
Go to Calneh and see. Then go on from there to Hamath the great, and go down to Gath of the Philistines. See if these kingdoms are better than yours; see if their territory is greater than yours!

(Amos 6:3) 
You postpone the day of misfortune and cling to the ways of wickedness!

(Amos 6:4) 
You sleep on ivory beds and sprawl on your couches, you eat the best lambs from the flock and the finest calves from the stall;

(Amos 6:5) 
You sing idle songs to the music of the harp. You are conceited, as if you are David, inventing musical instruments.

(Amos 6:6) 
You drink wine by the bowlful, and you anoint yourselves with the finest oils, but you are not grieved over the destruction of Israel.

(Amos 6:7) 
Therefore, you will now be the first to be taken into exile. The revelry of the arrogant will end.

(Amos 6:8) 
The Lord God has sworn by his own power: “I detest the pride of Jacob and hate their palaces. I will deliver this city and all that is in it to the enemy.”

(Amos 6:9) 
Will not the land tremble for this? Will not everyone who lives there mourn? The land will be flooded like the Nile, rising and falling again like the river of Egypt.

(Amos 6:10) 
And in that day, says the Lord God: “Your songs of praise will be turned to lamentation. And the music will be silenced.

(Amos 6:11) 
Your loud and frivolous partying will become weeping.

(Amos 6:12) 
Do horses run on the rocky terrain? Does one plow there with oxen? You have turned justice into bitter poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood.

(Amos 6:13) 
You are proud of what is worthless and you say, “Did we not seize power through our own strength?”

(Amos 6:14) 
But I am about to raise up against you, house of Israel, says the Lord, the God of hosts, and I will oppress you as a cart is crushed when it is overloaded with grain.

(Amos 6:15) 
The swift will lose their means of escape, the strong will lose their strength, and the mighty will not save themselves.

(Amos 6:16) 
Those who are skilled with a bow will not stand their ground, and the swift runner will not get away, and the horseman will not save himself.

(Amos 6:17) 
Even the most courageous soldier will flee naked on that day, says the Lord.

(Amos 7:1) 
These are the visions that Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa, saw about Israel, which he saw during the reigns of King Uzziah of Judah and King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

(Amos 7:2) 
And he said: "The Lord will roar from Zion, and He will give His voice from Jerusalem. The best pastures of the desert will mourn, and the field will wither because the whole earth is cursed, along with everyone who lives in it."

(Amos 7:3) 
This is what the Lord says: "For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not relent, because they threshed Gilead with saws, threshing them with iron saws."

(Amos 7:4) 
I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which will consume the foundations of Ben-hadad.

(Amos 7:5) 
I will break the bar of Damascus, and I will destroy the one who dwells in the field of pleasure, and the remnant of Syria will be exiled," says the Lord.

(Amos 7:6) 
This is what the Lord says: "For three crimes of Gaza, and for four, I will not relent, because they took captives and sold them completely to Edom."

(Amos 7:7) 
I will send fire into the walls of Gaza, and it will consume its foundations.

(Amos 7:8) 
I will destroy the one who lives in Ashdod, and the one who lives in Ashkelon, and I will turn My hand against Ekron. The remnant of the Philistines will perish," says the Lord God.

(Amos 7:9) 
This is what the Lord says: "For three crimes of Tyre, and for four, I will not relent, because they handed over captives completely to Edom."

(Amos 7:10) 
I will send fire into the walls of Tyre, and it will consume its foundations.

(Amos 7:11) 
This is what the Lord says: "For three crimes of Edom, and for four, I will not relent, because he pursued his brother with the sword, and broke every mercy, and in his fury he always tore him apart, and his anger kept itself forever."

(Amos 7:12) 
I will send fire into Teman, and it will consume the foundations of Bozrah.

(Amos 7:13) 
This is what the Lord says: "For three crimes of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not relent, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, in order to expand their territory."

(Amos 7:14) 
I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah, and it will consume its foundations, with a shout on the day of battle, and with a whirlwind on the day of destruction.

(Amos 7:15) 
Their king will go into captivity, along with his princes," says the Lord.

(Amos 8:1) 
This is what the Lord God showed to me, and behold, a basket of ripe fruits.

(Amos 8:2) 
And He said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of ripe fruits.” Then the Lord said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel. I will not spare them any further.

(Amos 8:3) 
In that day, the songs of the Temple will turn to wailing, says the Lord God. Many corpses will be cast out, in the place where they are buried.

(Amos 8:4) 
Hear this, you who oppress the poor and destroy the needy of the land.

(Amos 8:5) 
You say, “When will the new moon be over, so that we may sell our grain? When will the Sabbath be over, so that we may open our storehouses? We want to make the measure smaller, and increase the price, and falsify the scales.

(Amos 8:6) 
We want to buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals. We want to sell even the discarded wheat.

(Amos 8:7) 
The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: I will never forget all their deeds.

(Amos 8:8) 
Will not the land tremble for this, and will not all who dwell in it mourn? The land will rise like the Nile, and it will surge up and then sink like the river of Egypt.

(Amos 8:9) 
And in that day, says the Lord God, I will make the sun go down at noon, and I will darken the land in broad daylight.

(Amos 8:10) 
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation. I will bring sackcloth upon every back, and baldness upon every head. I will make it like mourning for an only son, and its end as a bitter day.

(Amos 8:11) 
Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.

(Amos 8:12) 
They will wander from sea to sea, and from the north to the east; they will run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord, but they will not find it.

(Amos 8:13) 
In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint from thirst.

(Amos 8:14) 
Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, who say, “As your god lives, O Dan,” and, “As the way of Beersheba lives,” they will fall, and never rise again.

(Amos 9:1) 
I saw the Lord standing near the altar and He said, “Strike at the top of the temple! Shake the threshold of the doors. The temple will collapse above their heads, and I will kill the rest of them by the sword. No one will escape, and no one will survive who runs away.”

(Amos 9:2) 
“Even if they dig their way into hell, I will bring them out. If they climb all the way up to the sky, I will bring them down.

(Amos 9:3) 
“If they hide in the highest place on Mount Carmel, I will search for them and bring them out. If they hide from me on the ocean floor, I will command the sea serpent to bite them.

(Amos 9:4) 
“If they are led away into captivity by their enemies, I will command the sword and kill them. I will fix my eyes on them for bad, and not for good.”

(Amos 9:5) 
The Lord God of hosts touches the earth and makes it melt, and all who live on the earth mourn. The earth will rise up like the Nile River, and then it will recede like the Nile.

(Amos 9:6) 
God has built His high place in the sky, and He has set the foundation of the Temple on the earth. He calls up the waters of the sea and pours them over the face of the earth. The Lord is His name.

(Amos 9:7) 
“Are you not like the children of Ethiopia to me, children of Israel?” says the Lord. “Did I not bring Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?

(Amos 9:8) 
“I am the Lord. I see the sin in this kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth. But I will not destroy them completely,” says the Lord.

(Amos 9:9) 
“I will give the command, and I will shake them among all the nations, like you shake wheat in the barn. Not a grain will fall to the ground.

(Amos 9:10) 
“The sinners of my people will die by the sword, those who say, ‘Evil will not come near us.’”

(Amos 9:11) 
“On that day, I will reestablish the fallen kingdom of David. I will repair its breaks, rebuild its ruins, and restore it as it was in the ancient days,

(Amos 9:12) 
so they may take possession of what remains of Edom and of all the nations. These are the people who are called by my name,” says the Lord, who does these things.

(Amos 9:13) 
“The days are coming,” says the Lord, “when the one plowing will catch the reaper, and the one who treads grapes will catch the one who is scattering the seeds. The mountains will drip with sweetness, and all the hills will be filled with fruits.

(Amos 9:14) 
“I will restore the captivity of my people Israel. They will rebuild the ruined cities and live there. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine. They will make gardens and eat their fruit.

(Amos 9:15) 
“I will plant them on their own land. They will never again be uprooted from the land that I have given them,” says the Lord your God.

(Obadiah 1:1) 
The vision of Abdias. God the Lord says this about Edom: I, God, have a message to deliver to the nations. Rise up, let us fight against Edom!

(Obadiah 1:2) 
Behold, I have made you a small nation among the nations. You are held in contempt.

(Obadiah 1:3) 
Your pride of heart has deceived you, O Edom, who dwell in the high, stony places. You say in your heart: “Who can bring me down to the earth?”

(Obadiah 1:4) 
Even if you soar like an eagle, even if you make your nest among the stars, I will bring you down, says the Lord.

(Obadiah 1:5) 
If thieves were to come to you, if robbers by night, how would you hide? Would they not steal until they had enough? If grape-gatherers came to you, surely they would leave some grapes behind!

(Obadiah 1:6) 
How have the descendants of Esau been plundered! How have their hidden treasures been sought out! Even to the end of the nation they have expelled you.

(Obadiah 1:7) 
All your allies have deceived you, and have prevailed against you, those who eat with you have set a trap for you: there is no understanding in him.

(Obadiah 1:8) 
On that day, says the Lord, I will destroy the wise men from Edom and all understanding from the mountain of Esau.

(Obadiah 1:9) 
And your mighty men, Teman, will be struck with fear, and I will destroy all understanding from the mountain of Esau.

(Obadiah 1:10) 
Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be destroyed forever.

(Obadiah 1:11) 
On the day that you stood by, when strangers carried off Jacob’s wealth, when foreigners entered his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.

(Obadiah 1:12) 
You should not have looked on the day of your brother’s misfortune, nor rejoiced over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction; nor should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

(Obadiah 1:13) 
You should not have entered the gate of my people on the day of their disaster, nor gloated over his misfortune on the day of his affliction, nor laid hands on his wealth on the day of his desolation.

(Obadiah 1:14) 
You should not have stood at the crossroads to cut off those who escaped, nor delivered over his survivors on the day of distress.

(Obadiah 1:15) 
For the day of the Lord is near against all the nations. As you have done, so shall it be done to you. Your actions will return upon your own head.

(Obadiah 1:16) 
For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so all the nations shall drink continually, and they shall drink and swallow, and be as though they had never been.

(Obadiah 1:17) 
But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance, and it will be holy; and the house of Jacob will possess those who possessed them.

(Obadiah 1:18) 
And the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau like stubble, and they will burn them and consume them. There will be no survivor of the house of Esau, because the Lord has spoken.

(Obadiah 1:19) 
Those of the south will possess the mountain of Esau, and those of the plain, the Philistines. They will possess the territories of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead.

(Obadiah 1:20) 
And the exiles of this army of the children of Israel will possess what is in Canaan as far as Zarephath; and the exiles of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, will possess the cities of the south.

(Obadiah 1:21) 
And saviors will go up to Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be the Lord’s.

(Jonah 1:1) 
The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying:

(Jonah 1:2) 
“Go to the great city of Nineveh, and preach to it: because its wickedness has come up before me.”

(Jonah 1:3) 
But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish, away from the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid his fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.

(Jonah 1:4) 
The Lord then sent a great wind on the sea, and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of breaking up.

(Jonah 1:5) 
The sailors were afraid, and each man cried to his god. They threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea, to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, and was fast asleep.

(Jonah 1:6) 
The shipmaster came to him and said, “What are you doing sleeping? Get up, call upon your God, so that God may think of us and we do not die.”

(Jonah 1:7) 
Each of them said to his companion: “Come, let’s cast lots, to find out why this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

(Jonah 1:8) 
Then they said to him, “Tell us why this evil has come upon us. What is your job, and where do you come from? What is your nation?”

(Jonah 1:9) 
He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the God of the universe who made the sea and the dry land.”

(Jonah 1:10) 
Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and they said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the Lord, because he had told them.

(Jonah 1:11) 
They said to him, “What should we do to you, that the sea may cease from us?” For the sea was getting rougher and rougher.

(Jonah 1:12) 
He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you. For I know that because of me this great storm has come upon you.”

(Jonah 1:13) 
The men rowed to get back to dry land, but they couldn’t. For the sea continued to rage more and more.

(Jonah 1:14) 
Then they called upon the Lord and said, “We beseech you, Lord, do not let us perish for the life of this man, and do not put innocent blood upon us. For you, Lord, have done as you have willed.”

(Jonah 1:15) 
So they took Jonah and threw him into the sea. And the sea stopped its raging.

(Jonah 1:16) 
Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.

(Jonah 1:17) 
Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.

(Jonah 2:1) 
And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish.

(Jonah 2:2) 
And he said: "In my suffering, I called out to the Lord, and he heard me:

(Jonah 2:3) 
From the depths of Sheol (the grave), I cried out, and you heard my voice.

(Jonah 2:4) 
You cast me into the deep sea, and the waves were all around me;

(Jonah 2:5) 
all of your great waves and surging seas passed over me.

(Jonah 2:6) 
And I said: 'I am cast out from before your eyes';

(Jonah 2:7) 
yet I will look upon your holy temple again.

(Jonah 2:8) 
The waters closed in around me, threatening my life;

(Jonah 2:9) 
the deep sea engulfed me; the ocean covered my head.

(Jonah 2:10) 
I sank to the foundations of the mountains; the earth's bars closed upon me forever.

(Jonah 2:11) 
But you brought my life back from corruption, O Lord my God.

(Jonah 2:12) 
When my soul was fainting within me, Lord, I remembered you:

(Jonah 2:13) 
and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.

(Jonah 2:14) 
Those who cling to worthless things abandon their own mercy.

(Jonah 2:15) 
But I, with a voice of thanksgiving, will offer sacrifice to you. I will pay what I have vowed for salvation.

(Jonah 2:16) 
And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto dry land.

(Jonah 3:1) 
The word of the Lord then came to Jonah a second time, saying:

(Jonah 3:2) 
“Go to the great city of Nineveh, and preach the message that I give to you there.”

(Jonah 3:3) 
So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city before God, a journey of three days.

(Jonah 3:4) 
Jonah began to enter the city, going the distance of one day’s walk. And he cried out, and said, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”

(Jonah 3:5) 
And the men of Nineveh believed in God. They proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least.

(Jonah 3:6) 
For word reached the king of Nineveh: and he arose from his throne, and laid aside his robe, and was covered with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

(Jonah 3:7) 
And he proclaimed and said in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen nor sheep, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water.

(Jonah 3:8) 
And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to God with all their might. Let each one turn from their evil way and from the wickedness that is in their hands.

(Jonah 3:9) 
Who knows if God will turn and repent, and turn away from the wrath of His fury, so that we may not perish?”

(Jonah 3:10) 
And God saw their works, that they had turned from their evil way. And God had mercy on the evil that He said He would do to them, and He did not do it.

(Jonah 4:1) 
And Jonas was very displeased, and he became angry.

(Jonah 4:2) 
And he prayed to the Lord, and said, "I beseech Thee, Lord, was not this my word when I was still in my own land? Therefore, I fled to Tharsis, for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and merciful, patient, and of great compassion, and easy to forgive evil."

(Jonah 4:3) 
And now, Lord, take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."

(Jonah 4:4) 
And the Lord said, "Do you think it is right to be angry?"

(Jonah 4:5) 
And Jonas went out of the city, and sat down on the east side of it, and he made himself a booth there, and sat under it, to see what would happen to the city.

(Jonah 4:6) 
And the Lord God caused a gourd vine to grow up over the head of Jonas, to make a shade over his head, and to protect him; for he had toiled.

(Jonah 4:7) 
And Jonas was exceedingly glad because of the gourd vine.

(Jonah 4:8) 
But God prepared a worm when the dawn came up, and it struck the gourd vine, and it withered.

(Jonah 4:9) 
And it came to pass when the sun rose, that a burning wind blew, and the sun struck the head of Jonas, and he fainted, and he desired his own death, and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."

(Jonah 4:10) 
And God said to Jonas, "Do you think it is right to be angry about the gourd vine?" And he said, "I am right to be angry, even unto death."

(Jonah 4:11) 
And the Lord said, "You are sorry for the gourd vine, which you did not labor on, nor did you make it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

(Jonah 4:12) 
and should not I spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know how to distinguish between their right hand and their left, and also many animals?"

(Micah 1:1) 
The Word of the Lord, which came to Micah of Moresheth, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, that he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

(Micah 1:2) 
Listen, all you peoples: let the earth give ear and the world around it: and let the Lord God be your witness, the Lord from his holy temple.

(Micah 1:3) 
Because, behold, the Lord will leave His place, and will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.

(Micah 1:4) 
And the mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys will be split open as wax before the fire, and as waters that rush down a precipice.

(Micah 1:5) 
All of this is because of the sin of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is the sin of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what are the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?

(Micah 1:6) 
I will make Samaria like a heap of stones in the field, in the planting of a vineyard: and I will cast down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.

(Micah 1:7) 
And all her graven images will be broken to pieces, and all her wages will be burned with fire, and I will make all her idols desolate: for she gathered them from the wages of a harlot, and she will return to the wages of a harlot.

(Micah 1:8) 
Therefore will I wail and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a lamentation as for the dragons, and a mourning as for the daughters of ostriches.

(Micah 1:9) 
Because her wound is desperate: for it is come even to Judah, it has touched the gate of my people Jerusalem.

(Micah 1:10) 
Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: in the house of dust, you shall sprinkle yourselves with dust.

(Micah 1:11) 
Pass over, you that dwell in Saphir, naked with shame: she that dwells in Sanan will not go forth. The mourning of Joath: he will take away from you his hope.

(Micah 1:12) 
For the inhabitant of Maroth is become weak for good: because evil is come down from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.

(Micah 1:13) 
Harness the chariot to the chariot, inhabitant of Lachis: the beginning of sin is to the daughter of Sion: for in you are found the wicked deeds of Israel.

(Micah 1:14) 
Therefore she will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath: the houses of Achzib will be a lie to the kings of Israel.

(Micah 1:15) 
I will bring to you again the heir, inhabitant of Maresa: even to Odollam will come the glory of Israel.

(Micah 1:16) 
Make yourself bald, and shave off the hair of your head for your delicate sons: enlarge your baldness as the eagle: because they are gone from you.

(Micah 2:1) 
Woe to those who plan wickedness, and work evil in your beds! You will bring it to completion in the morning light, because it is in your power.

(Micah 2:2) 
And they covet fields, and seize them by force, and houses, and take them away: they have calumniated the man and his house, the man and his inheritance.

(Micah 2:3) 
Therefore, the Lord says this: Behold, I am planning evil against this generation, from which you will not remove your necks, and you will not walk proudly, for it is an evil time.

(Micah 2:4) 
In that day, a parable will be taken up against you, and sung in a song, saying:

(Micah 2:5) 
“We are utterly destroyed! He has taken my portion of the land. He has parceled out my fields.”

(Micah 2:6) 
Therefore, there will be no one for you to cast a lot in the assembly of the Lord.

(Micah 2:7) 
“Do not preach,” they say, “do not prophesy.” They will not prophesy to these, and they will not suffer reproaches.

(Micah 2:8) 
But I say: What will you speak? For an evil time will come.

(Micah 2:9) 
And he said: “Listen to what I speak: Do not hope. Do not hope,” he said, “in the sons of iniquity.”

(Micah 2:10) 
Because you suddenly drive away my people: from their garments you take away the robe, from those passing by confidently, turning them away.

(Micah 2:11) 
The women of my people you cast out from the houses of their delights, taking away their glory forever from their children.

(Micah 2:12) 
Arise, and go, because there is no rest here because of the uncleanness that ruins, a most grievous ruin.

(Micah 2:13) 
If I were to walk in the spirit and go falsely, I would say to you, “Prophesy,” and I would prophesy to you of wine and drunkenness, and this would be the people I would speak to.

(Micah 3:1) 
And I said: “Listen, rulers of Israel! You leaders of the house of Jacob, shouldn’t you know what’s right?

(Micah 3:2) 
You hate good and you love evil. You tear the skin off the poor and take away their flesh from their bones.

(Micah 3:3) 
You eat the flesh of my people, you rip the skin off them, you break their bones, you chop them up like meat in a pot, like flesh in a cauldron.

(Micah 3:4) 
Then they will cry to the Lord, but He will not answer them. He will hide His face from them in that time, because of the evil they have done.

(Micah 3:5) 
Thus says the Lord about the false prophets who lead my people astray: “They bite with their teeth and cry out, ‘Peace!’ If anyone does not give them something to eat, they prepare war against him.”

(Micah 3:6) 
Therefore, the night will be for you instead of vision, and darkness will be for you instead of divination. The sun will set upon the prophets, and the day will be darkened for them.

(Micah 3:7) 
Then the seers will be ashamed, and the diviners will blush. They will all cover their mouths, for there will be no answer from God.

(Micah 3:8) 
But as for me, I am filled with the power of the Spirit of the Lord, and with justice and strength, to declare to Jacob his crimes and to Israel his sins.

(Micah 3:9) 
Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, you who hate justice, and who pervert all that is right:

(Micah 3:10) 
You build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

(Micah 3:11) 
Its leaders judge for a bribe, its priests teach for pay, and its prophets divine for money. And they lean on the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord not among us? No evil will come upon us.”

(Micah 3:12) 
Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem will be a heap of stones, and the mountain of the temple will be like the high places of the forest.

(Micah 4:1) 
In the last days, the mountain of the Lord's house will be made ready. This mountain will be the highest of all mountains, and more important than the hills. And people will come to it.

(Micah 4:2) 
Many nations will hasten to it, and they will say, “Come! Let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For the Law will go out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”

(Micah 4:3) 
He will judge among many peoples, and will rebuke strong nations from afar. And they will turn their swords into plowshares, and their spears into sickles. Nation shall not take up the sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.

(Micah 4:4) 
Everyone will sit under their own vine, and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid. For the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has spoken.

(Micah 4:5) 
For all peoples will walk, each in the name of their own god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, forever and ever.

(Micah 4:6) 
“In that day,” says the Lord, “I will gather the lame, and the one who was cast out, and the one whom I afflicted.”

(Micah 4:7) 
I will make the lame a remnant, and the one who was weary, a strong nation. And the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion, from now and forever.

(Micah 4:8) 
And you, O tower of the flock, O fortified hill of the daughter of Zion, the former dominion will come to you, and the kingdom will come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

(Micah 4:9) 
Now, why do you cry aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, that pain has seized you like a woman in labor?

(Micah 4:10) 
Be in pain, and labor, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor. For now you will go out of the city, and you will live in the countryside, and you will come to the field; and there you will be saved.

(Micah 4:11) 
Now many nations are gathered against you, saying, “Let her be profaned, and let our eye see in Zion.”

(Micah 4:12) 
But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord, and they have not understood His plan, for He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.

(Micah 4:13) 
Arise, and thresh, daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze, and you will crush many peoples, and you will consecrate the Lord of the earth, and their plunder to the Lord.

(Micah 5:1) 
Now you must gather your troops. A siege will be set against us. With a rod, the judge of Israel will strike on the cheek.

(Micah 5:2) 
And you, Bethlehem Ephrata, are small among the clans of Judah, but from you, the ruler of Israel will come forth for me, whose origins are from old, even from eternity itself.

(Micah 5:3) 
Therefore, God will let them be defeated until the one who will give birth has given birth, and then the rest of his brothers will return to the Israelites.

(Micah 5:4) 
He will stand and lead them in the strength of the Lord, in the glorious name of the Lord his God. And they will be converted and be with him, because his kingdom will be made great until the ends of the earth.

(Micah 5:5) 
And He will be peace, and when the Assyrians invade our land, and tread on our houses, we will raise up against them seven shepherds, and eight leaders from among mankind.

(Micah 5:6) 
They will shepherd the land of the Assyrians with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with his spears. And they will save us from the Assyrian, when he invades our land, and when he steps inside our borders.

(Micah 5:7) 
And the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples, like dew from the Lord, like showers on the grass, not waiting on man, nor expecting the sons of men.

(Micah 5:8) 
The remnant of Jacob will be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, when he passes through, tramples, and seizes, and there is none to rescue.

(Micah 5:9) 
Let your hand be raised against your enemies, and may all your enemies perish.

(Micah 5:10) 
And in that day, says the Lord, I will take away your horses from among you, and I will destroy your chariots.

(Micah 5:11) 
I will remove the cities of your land, and I will tear down all your fortresses.

(Micah 5:12) 
I will take away your sorceries, and there will be no divination practiced by you.

(Micah 5:13) 
I will take away your carved images, and your idols, and you shall no longer worship the works of your hands.

(Micah 5:14) 
I will tear out your groves from your midst, and I will destroy your cities.

(Micah 5:15) 
And I will execute vengeance in wrath and indignation on the nations who have not obeyed.

(Micah 6:1) 
Hear what the Lord is saying: “Rise up. Make your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.”

(Micah 6:2) 
Mountains, hear the Lord’s legal case. You solid foundations of the earth, listen to the judgment. For the Lord is in judgment with His people, and He will contend with Israel.

(Micah 6:3) 
My people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Answer Me.

(Micah 6:4) 
Because I brought you out of the land of Egypt. I freed you from slavery. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

(Micah 6:5) 
My people, remember what Balak, king of Moab, planned, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and the journey from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.

(Micah 6:6) 
With what shall I come before the Lord, and bow down to God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?

(Micah 6:7) 
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn son for my wickedness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

(Micah 6:8) 
He has shown you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you. Surely, to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk carefully with your God.

(Micah 6:9) 
The Lord's voice cries out to the city: Fear will call, and the wise will see your name. Listen, you tribes, and all who are gathered.

(Micah 6:10) 
Are there still treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked? And a diminished measure, full of curse?

(Micah 6:11) 
Shall I justify the wicked balance, and the deceitful purse in my hand?

(Micah 6:12) 
Because the rich of the city are filled with wickedness, and its inhabitants have spoken lies, and their tongues are deceitful in their mouth.

(Micah 6:13) 
So now I have struck you, making you barren because of your sins.

(Micah 6:14) 
You will eat, but not be satisfied. Your despair will be in your midst. You will take in, but not save. And those you save, I will deliver to the sword.

(Micah 6:15) 
You will sow, but not reap. You will tread the olive, but you will not anoint yourself with oil. You will crush the grapes, but will not drink the wine.

(Micah 6:16) 
You have kept the statutes of Omri and all the works of the house of Ahab. You have walked in their ways, so that I would make you a ruin. I will make your inhabitants a hissing, and you will bear the reproach of My people.

(Micah 7:1) 
Woe is me, for I am become as a man who gathers the remnants of the harvest. There is no ripe cluster of grapes to eat, and the first fruits that I desired have passed away.

(Micah 7:2) 
The holy ones have vanished from the land, and there is no one who acts uprightly among men. They all lie in wait for the blood of their neighbors, each one hunts his brother unto death.

(Micah 7:3) 
Their hands are ready to do evil. The prince demands a bribe, and the judge is influenced by money. The great man expresses the desire of his soul, and they thus conspire together.

(Micah 7:4) 
The best of them is like a thornbush, and the most upright is like a thorny hedge. The day of their punishment is coming, the day that they have been warned about.

(Micah 7:5) 
Do not trust your neighbor, and do not rely on a friend. Be on guard against the one who lies in your bosom; keep the doors of your mouth.

(Micah 7:6) 
For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies are the men of his own house.

(Micah 7:7) 
But I will look to the Lord; I will wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me.

(Micah 7:8) 
Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy, for though I have fallen, I will arise. When I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light.

(Micah 7:9) 
I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He judges my cause and executes my judgment. He will bring me out into the light; I will see His justice.

(Micah 7:10) 
Then my enemy will see, and she will be covered with shame, she who said to me, “Where is the Lord your God?” My eyes will gaze upon her; now she will be for trampling, like the mud in the streets.

(Micah 7:11) 
In the day that your walls are to be rebuilt, in that day the boundary will be extended. In that day the Assyrian will come to you, and to the fortified cities.

(Micah 7:12) 
In that day, they will come to you from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortresses to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

(Micah 7:13) 
And the land will be desolate because of its inhabitants, as a result of their deeds.

(Micah 7:14) 
Shepherd Your people with Your staff, the flock of Your inheritance, those who dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

(Micah 7:15) 
As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, I will show them wonders.

(Micah 7:16) 
The nations will see and be ashamed of all their power; they will put their hand over their mouth, their ears will be deaf.

(Micah 7:17) 
They will lick the dust like a serpent, like the reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses, and they will fear the Lord our God and be afraid.

(Micah 7:18) 
Who is a God like You, who removes iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance? He does not hold onto anger forever because He delights in mercy.

(Micah 7:19) 
He will turn again and have mercy on us. He will tread our iniquities underfoot, and will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.

(Micah 7:20) 
You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, which You swore to our fathers from days of old.

(Nahum 1:1) 
A prophecy about Nineveh. The record of Nahum of Elkosh.

(Nahum 1:2) 
The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord is avenging and full of wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries and is angry with His enemies.

(Nahum 1:3) 
The Lord is slow to anger, but great in power; He will not acquit the guilty. His way is in the tempest and the storm is under His feet.

(Nahum 1:4) 
He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the bloom of Lebanon fades.

(Nahum 1:5) 
The mountains quake because of Him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles before Him, the world and all who dwell in it.

(Nahum 1:6) 
Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the heat of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are shattered by Him.

(Nahum 1:7) 
The Lord is good, a refuge in the day of distress; He knows those who trust in Him.

(Nahum 1:8) 
But with an overflowing flood He will make an end of its place, and will pursue His enemies into darkness.

(Nahum 1:9) 
What do you plot against the Lord? He will make an end; He will not take vengeance twice.

(Nahum 1:10) 
For though they are like tangled thorns, though they are drunkards as they drink, they shall be consumed like dry stubble.

(Nahum 1:11) 
From you came one who devised evil against the Lord, a wicked counselor.

(Nahum 1:12) 
Thus says the Lord: “Though they are at full strength and many, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.

(Nahum 1:13) 
And now I will break his yoke from your neck, and I will burst your bonds.

(Nahum 1:14) 
The Lord has given a command concerning you: Your name shall be perpetuated no longer. From the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the cast image. I will make your grave, for you are worthless.

(Nahum 1:15) 
Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, fulfill your vows, for never again shall the wicked pass through you; he is utterly cut off.

(Nahum 2:1) 
The army is coming! Prepare yourself. Guard your city. Strengthen your defenses.

(Nahum 2:2) 
The Lord will destroy the pride of Jacob, as He destroyed Israel. Because the destroyers will destroy them and break their branches.

(Nahum 2:3) 
The shields of their soldiers are red. Their soldiers are dressed in scarlet. The fire of destruction is ready. The chariots are like lightning!

(Nahum 2:4) 
The chariots will rush through the streets, colliding in the city squares. The appearance of the soldiers is like torches, as flashes of lightning.

(Nahum 2:5) 
The best soldiers will be called forward, but they will stumble in their haste. The city's protective wall will be prepared.

(Nahum 2:6) 
The river gates will be opened, and the palace will be captured.

(Nahum 2:7) 
The captives will be taken away, and the captive women will mourn like doves.

(Nahum 2:8) 
Nineveh is like a pool of water, but its people are fleeing. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.

(Nahum 2:9) 
Take the silver! Take the gold! There is no end to the valuable treasures.

(Nahum 2:10) 
Nineveh is now wasted, plundered, and destroyed. The heart is broken, the knees are shaking, the body trembles, and the faces are blackened.

(Nahum 2:11) 
Where is the den of the lions? Where is the feeding ground for the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked? No one will scare them now.

(Nahum 2:12) 
The lion tore apart enough for its cubs, and strangled enough for the lionesses. He filled his caves with prey and his dens with spoils.

(Nahum 2:13) 
“I am against you,” says the Lord of Hosts. “I will burn your chariots in smoke. The sword will consume your young lions. I will not let your spoils echo your boasts.”

(Nahum 2:14) 
The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard. Your city will never again be destroyed.

(Nahum 3:1) 
Woe to that bloody city! That city of constant lies and endless robbery! The pillaging will never end.

(Nahum 3:2) 
Listen to the cracking whip! Hear the noise of the wheels! See the galloping horses and the bouncing chariots,

(Nahum 3:3) 
Watch the horsemen charging, the flashing swords and the glittering spears! There are so many dead. Corpses pile up. There is no end to the dead! They stumble over the bodies.

(Nahum 3:4) 
This is because of the countless sins of the prostitute, the beautiful harlot! She seduced the nations with her prostitution and the families with her spells.

(Nahum 3:5) 
“Look,” says the Lord of Hosts, “I am against you! I will lift your skirts and expose your shame before the nations, and show the kingdoms your disgrace.

(Nahum 3:6) 
I will cast abominations upon you and disgrace you. I will make you a spectacle.

(Nahum 3:7) 
Then everyone who sees you will flee from you, saying, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will mourn for her?' Where shall I seek someone to comfort you?

(Nahum 3:8) 
Are you better than Thebes, which was situated on the Nile, surrounded by water? Her ramparts were the sea; the water was her wall.

(Nahum 3:9) 
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength. There was no limit to her power. Put and Libya were among her allies.

(Nahum 3:10) 
Yet she was captured and carried away. Her little children were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.

(Nahum 3:11) 
So you also will become drunk and hidden. You will seek refuge from the enemy.

(Nahum 3:12) 
All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe figs; if they are shaken, they fall straight into the mouth of the eater.

(Nahum 3:13) 
Look, your people within you are like women. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed your bars.

(Nahum 3:14) 
Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the mud and trample it. Repair your brick molds.

(Nahum 3:15) 
There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; increase like the grasshopper.

(Nahum 3:16) 
You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the sky. Like the locust, they swarm and fly away.

(Nahum 3:17) 
Your princes are like grasshoppers, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle on the walls in the cold. When the sun comes up, they fly away, and no one knows where they have gone.

(Nahum 3:18) 
Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria. Your nobles lie in the dust; your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.

(Nahum 3:19) 
There is no healing for your wound. Your injury is severe. All who hear the news of you clap their hands over you, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?

(Habakkuk 1:1) 
This is the burden of prophecy that Habakkuk saw.

(Habakkuk 1:2) 
How much longer, Lord, will I cry out to you, and will you not hear? How much longer will I complain of violence to you, and will you not save?

(Habakkuk 1:3) 
Why do you show me wickedness and toil, that I may see injustice and the destruction of those who do wrong to me? Because of this, judgment will come, and strife will come upon all.

(Habakkuk 1:4) 
Because of this, the law is weakened, and the judgment never succeeds: because the wicked are stronger than the righteous. Therefore, perverse judgment comes forth.

(Habakkuk 1:5) 
Look among the nations and see, and be astonished, and be astounded: because you will do a work in your days that you will not believe when it is told.

(Habakkuk 1:6) 
Because behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation that marches across the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that are not their own.

(Habakkuk 1:7) 
They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and their power will come forth from themselves.

(Habakkuk 1:8) 
Their horses are swifter than leopards, and they are more fierce than wolves at evening; their horsemen are proud.

(Habakkuk 1:9) 
They will all come to plunder; their faces will be as a burning wind, and they will gather captives like sand.

(Habakkuk 1:10) 
They themselves will mock kings, and they will scoff at princes; they will laugh at every fortress and they will build a ramp to capture it.

(Habakkuk 1:11) 
Then his spirit will change, and he will pass through; and he will consider this power to be his own wickedness.

(Habakkuk 1:12) 
Are you not from the beginning, Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Lord, you have appointed him for judgment, and you have set him as a rebuke.

(Habakkuk 1:13) 
You whose eyes are pure and cannot look upon evil, who cannot look upon wickedness, why do you look on those who act unjustly, and are silent when the wicked devour one more just than themselves?

(Habakkuk 1:14) 
You make humans like the fish of the sea, and like the creeping things that have no ruler.

(Habakkuk 1:15) 
He takes them all up with a hook and drags them into his net and gathers them into his dragnet; over this, he rejoices and exults.

(Habakkuk 1:16) 
For this reason, he will sacrifice to his net, and he will offer sacrifices to his dragnet: because for this reason, his portion is fattened, and his food is rich.

(Habakkuk 1:17) 
Therefore, will he empty his sword, and will he not have mercy on the nations?

(Habakkuk 2:1) 
I will stand guard over my watch. I will go on. I will stand on my watchtower to see what He might say to me in response to my prayers.

(Habakkuk 2:2) 
The Lord will answer me. He will say, “Write down the vision. Make it clear on tablets, so that everyone who reads it can run with it.”

(Habakkuk 2:3) 
For the vision is not of immediate fulfillment. It looks ahead to the end, and it will not lie. If it seems to tarry, wait for it. It will surely come; it will not delay.

(Habakkuk 2:4) 
Behold, the arrogant one is not upright within himself. But the just man will live by his faith.

(Habakkuk 2:5) 
Truly, because of wine, the proud man is arrogant and restless; he does not remain at peace. His soul is as vast as Sheol, like death, and he gathers all nations to himself, like death.

(Habakkuk 2:6) 
Will not all of these take up a parable against him? Will they not utter a riddle concerning him and say, “Woe to him who amasses what is not his own! How long will he keep gathering debts against himself?”

(Habakkuk 2:7) 
Will they not suddenly arise who will bite you, those who will agitate you so fiercely? And you will become their plunder.

(Habakkuk 2:8) 
Because you have plundered many nations, the remnant of the peoples will plunder you for the blood of man and the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all who live in it.

(Habakkuk 2:9) 
Woe to him who gathers evil gain for his house, setting his nest on high to be delivered from the reach of evil!

(Habakkuk 2:10) 
You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many peoples, and you have sinned against your own soul.

(Habakkuk 2:11) 
For the stone will cry out from the wall, and the beam from the woodwork will answer.

(Habakkuk 2:12) 
Woe to him who builds a city with blood, and prepares a town with iniquity!

(Habakkuk 2:13) 
Is this not from the Lord of hosts? The peoples labor only for fire, and the nations weary themselves only for nothing.

(Habakkuk 2:14) 
For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

(Habakkuk 2:15) 
Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor, pouring out his venom to make him drunk, so that he may look on his nakedness!

(Habakkuk 2:16) 
You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory. Drink yourself and be uncircumcised! The cup in the Lord’s right hand will come around to you, and utter shame will come upon your glory.

(Habakkuk 2:17) 
For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the beasts will terrify you because of the blood of man and the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all who live in it.

(Habakkuk 2:18) 
Of what use is an idol, since its maker has crafted it? It is an image, a teacher of lies! For the maker trusts in his own work, though he has produced mute idols.

(Habakkuk 2:19) 
Woe to him who says to wood, “Awake!” and to a mute stone, “Arise!” Can it teach? Behold, it is covered with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it.

(Habakkuk 2:20) 
But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him.

(Habakkuk 3:1) 
This is the prayer of the prophet Habakkuk, who had difficulty understanding God.

(Habakkuk 3:2) 
Lord, I heard Your fame, and I was afraid.

(Habakkuk 3:3) 
I considered Your works, and I was filled with awe.

(Habakkuk 3:4) 
Lord, revive Your work as the years pass.

(Habakkuk 3:5) 
As the years pass, make Your power known.

(Habakkuk 3:6) 
Even when my soul is troubled, remember Your mercy.

(Habakkuk 3:7) 
God will come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount Pharan.

(Habakkuk 3:8) 
His glory covered the skies, and the earth is filled with praise of Him.

(Habakkuk 3:9) 
His splendor will be like light: He has all power in His hands.

(Habakkuk 3:10) 
In Him is all strength hidden.

(Habakkuk 3:11) 
Before Him will go pestilence, and the devil will walk before His feet.

(Habakkuk 3:12) 
He stood, and measured the land.

(Habakkuk 3:13) 
He looked, and the nations were terrified.

(Habakkuk 3:14) 
The ancient mountains were crushed, the hills of the world were bowed down, from His eternal paths.

(Habakkuk 3:15) 
Because of iniquity, I saw the tents of Ethiopia; the coverings of the land of Midian were troubled.

(Habakkuk 3:16) 
Were You angry with the rivers, Lord?

(Habakkuk 3:17) 
Was Your fury against the sea?

(Habakkuk 3:18) 
You rode on Your horses, and Your chariots brought salvation.

(Habakkuk 3:19) 
You roused Your bow, and prepared it for battle.

(Habakkuk 3:20) 
You spoke oaths to the tribes.

(Habakkuk 3:21) 
You divided the rivers of the land.

(Habakkuk 3:22) 
The mountains saw You, and were in pain: the torrents of waters passed by.

(Habakkuk 3:23) 
The deep gave forth a sound; the depths sent out their voice.

(Habakkuk 3:24) 
He lifted up His hands to the heights.

(Habakkuk 3:25) 
The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling, at the light of Your arrows they shall go, in the splendor of Your flashing spear.

(Habakkuk 3:26) 
In anger, You trampled the earth; in fury, You destroyed the nations.

(Habakkuk 3:27) 
You went out to save Your people, to save Your people with Your anointed ones.

(Habakkuk 3:28) 
You struck the head from the house of the wicked; You laid bare the foundation even to the neck.

(Habakkuk 3:29) 
You cursed their scepters, the heads of their warriors.

(Habakkuk 3:30) 
You invaded the sea with Your horses, in the tumult of many waters.

(Habakkuk 3:31) 
I heard, and my belly was troubled.

(Habakkuk 3:32) 
At the voice of my lips, trembling entered into my bones, and I trembled.

(Habakkuk 3:33) 
I waited for the day of tribulation, that I may ascend to the people who are girded for battle.

(Habakkuk 3:34) 
For the fig tree will not blossom, and there will be no fruit on the vines.

(Habakkuk 3:35) 
The labor of the olive trees will be in vain, and the vineyards will not give fruit.

(Habakkuk 3:36) 
All the food in the field will fail, and there will be no cattle in the stalls.

(Habakkuk 3:37) 
Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, and I will be joyful in God, my Savior.

(Habakkuk 3:38) 
The Lord God is my strength, and He will make my feet like those of the hinds.

(Habakkuk 3:39) 
He will bring me to the heights, where I can sing a song of victory.

(Zephaniah 1:1) 
The Word of the Lord, which was delivered to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah:

(Zephaniah 1:2) 
The Lord says, “I will completely sweep away the land.”

(Zephaniah 1:3) 
“I will take away men and the animals; I will take away the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea. And the wicked will collapse along with their sins. I will destroy all mankind from the face of the land,” says the Lord.

(Zephaniah 1:4) 
“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all those who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy from this place the remnants of Baal, and the names of the false priests, along with the true priests.

(Zephaniah 1:5) 
“Also, I will destroy those who worship the armies of the sky on the rooftops, and who worship, and swear by the Lord, and swear by Milcom.

(Zephaniah 1:6) 
“I will also destroy those who have turned away from the Lord, those who have not sought after the Lord, nor inquired after Him.”

(Zephaniah 1:7) 
Be silent before the face of the Lord God, because the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared his sacrifice, he has sanctified those whom he has called.

(Zephaniah 1:8) 
“And on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, I will visit the princes and the sons of the king, and all those who are clothed in foreign garments.

(Zephaniah 1:9) 
“On that day I will visit everyone who leaps over the threshold, who fills the house with violence and deceit.

(Zephaniah 1:10) 
“On that day,” says the Lord, “there will be a cry of wailing from the Fish Gate, and a lamentation from the second quarter, and a great destruction from the hills.

(Zephaniah 1:11) 
Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar, because all the people of Canaan have become silent; all those who were merchants have been destroyed.

(Zephaniah 1:12) 
“At that time I will thoroughly search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will visit the men of renown who say in their hearts, ‘The Lord does not act for good, nor does he act for evil.’

(Zephaniah 1:13) 
“And their wealth will be for plunder, and their houses for desolation; they will build houses, but not inhabit them, and they will plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.”

(Zephaniah 1:14) 
The great day of the Lord is near; it is near, and hastens quickly; the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter; there the strong man will cry out.

(Zephaniah 1:15) 
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

(Zephaniah 1:16) 
a day of the trumpet and the battle cry against the fortified cities and against the high corners.

(Zephaniah 1:17) 
“I will bring distress upon men, and they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the Lord; and their blood will be poured out like dust, and their bodies like dung.

(Zephaniah 1:18) 
“Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land will be consumed in the fire of his jealousy, for he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the land.”

(Zephaniah 2:1) 
Gather yourselves together, you nations that don't care about God,

(Zephaniah 2:2) 
Before the time to act comes like the wind blows the dust away, before the anger of the Lord's fury comes on you, before the Lord's day of wrath descends on you.

(Zephaniah 2:3) 
Seek the Lord, all you humble ones of the earth, you who work to do His will. Seek righteousness, seek meekness, so that perhaps you may be protected on the day of the Lord's fury.

(Zephaniah 2:4) 
For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ascalon will become a wasteland. They will cast out the people of Ashdod at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.

(Zephaniah 2:5) 
Woe to you who live on the coast, you nation of the lost! The Lord's word is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. I will destroy you so that no one will live there.

(Zephaniah 2:6) 
The coast will become pastures and folds for flocks, for those who rest in the middle of their herds.

(Zephaniah 2:7) 
And those who remain of the house of Judah will be saved, and they will graze in the houses of Ascalon, when they sit at evening.

(Zephaniah 2:8) 
I have heard the taunts of Moab and the insults of the children of Ammon, who have reproached My people and have magnified themselves against their borders.

(Zephaniah 2:9) 
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah: a possession of thorns, and salt pits, and a desolation forever: the remnants of My people will plunder them, and the remnants of My nation will possess them.

(Zephaniah 2:10) 
This will happen to them for their pride, because they have reproached and have magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts.

(Zephaniah 2:11) 
The Lord will be terrible against them: He will destroy all the gods of the earth; and all the islands of the nations, each in its own place, will worship Him.

(Zephaniah 2:12) 
You Ethiopians, you also will be slain by My sword.

(Zephaniah 2:13) 
And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as the desert.

(Zephaniah 2:14) 
Herds will lie down in its midst, all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the hedgehog will lodge in its thresholds; the owl will hoot in the windows; the raven will be in the roof beams; for their strength has been crushed.

(Zephaniah 2:15) 
This is the joyful city that dwelt securely, that said in her heart: 'I am, and there is no more.' How has she become a desolation, a den for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss and shake their hand.

(Zephaniah 3:1) 
What misery awaits the rebellious, polluted, oppressing city!

(Zephaniah 3:2) 
It has not obeyed God. It has rejected all guidance. It did not trust in the Lord. It would not approach its God.

(Zephaniah 3:3) 
Its leaders are roaring lions in the city. Its judges are wolves at dusk, devouring until dawn.

(Zephaniah 3:4) 
Its prophets are brash and untrustworthy men. Its priests defile holy things, and they disrespect the law.

(Zephaniah 3:5) 
The Lord, who is just, is within it. He will do no injustice. Every morning, He brings His judgment to light, and it never fails.

(Zephaniah 3:6) 
He has destroyed nations. Their towers are desolate. He has made their roads deserted so no one can pass. Their cities are desolate, without inhabitants.

(Zephaniah 3:7) 
I said: Surely you will fear Me and accept guidance. You will not be destroyed before My eyes, nor lose all of My decrees. But instead, rising up every morning, they corrupt all their thoughts.

(Zephaniah 3:8) 
Therefore, be patient and wait for Me, says the Lord, until the day I arise to judge. Because My judgment will come upon the nations so I can gather kings and gather kingdoms, pouring out upon them all My indignation, all the heat of My anger. For in the fire of My zeal, all the earth will be consumed.

(Zephaniah 3:9) 
Then I will give to the peoples a pure tongue so that all will call on the name of the Lord, and they will serve Him with one accord.

(Zephaniah 3:10) 
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My supplicants, the remnant of My scattered, will bring offerings to Me.

(Zephaniah 3:11) 
In that day, you will not be ashamed because of all your deeds, by which you have transgressed against Me. Then I will remove from your midst those who boast of their pride. You will never again be exalted on My holy mountain.

(Zephaniah 3:12) 
I will leave within you a poor and humble people, and they will trust in the name of the Lord.

(Zephaniah 3:13) 
The remnant of Israel will do no wrong, nor will they speak lies, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth. For they will feed and rest, and no one will frighten them.

(Zephaniah 3:14) 
Sing, daughter of Zion; shout with joy, Israel; rejoice and exult, daughter of Jerusalem, with all your heart.

(Zephaniah 3:15) 
The Lord has removed your judgment; He has turned away your enemies. The Lord, the King of Israel, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil.

(Zephaniah 3:16) 
In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, Zion; let not your hands be slack.”

(Zephaniah 3:17) 
The Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior, He will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will be silent in His love for you; He will rejoice over you with singing.

(Zephaniah 3:18) 
I will gather those who mourn for the feasts, who are of you, and I will take away your disgrace.

(Zephaniah 3:19) 
Behold, I will deal with all those who afflict you at that time; and I will save the lame and gather the outcast; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the earth.

(Zephaniah 3:20) 
At that time, I will bring you in, and at the time I gather you together; for I will give you renown and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the Lord.

(Haggai 1:1) 
In the second year that Darius was king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the Lord spoke to Haggai the prophet, to Zorobabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:

(Haggai 1:2) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘This people says: ‘The time to build the Lord’s house has not yet come.’”

(Haggai 1:3) 
Then the Lord spoke through Haggai the prophet, saying:

(Haggai 1:4) 
“Is it right for you to be living in your paneled homes while this house remains in ruins?”

(Haggai 1:5) 
“Now, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Consider your ways!’

(Haggai 1:6) 
“You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but you are not satisfied. You drink, but you are not drunk. You put on clothes, but you are not warm. The one who earns wages puts them in a bag full of holes.’”

(Haggai 1:7) 
“This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Consider your ways!’

(Haggai 1:8) 
“Go up into the hills, bring timber, and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,’ says the Lord.”

(Haggai 1:9) 
“You expected much, but it came to little. When you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?” says the Lord of Hosts. “Because my house is ruined, while each of you is busy with your own home.”

(Haggai 1:10) 
“Therefore, the sky has withheld the dew over you, and the earth has withheld its produce.

(Haggai 1:11) 
“I have called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the wine, on the oil, on everything that the ground produces, and on men, on animals, and on all the work of your hands.”

(Haggai 1:12) 
Then Zorobabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the rest of the people listened to the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord.

(Haggai 1:13) 
Then Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, gave the Lord’s message to the people, saying: “I am with you, says the Lord.”

(Haggai 1:14) 
So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the rest of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the Lord of Hosts on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

(Haggai 2:1) 
In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the Son revealed himself to the prophet Haggai, and through Haggai spoke the Lord to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, who was the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:

(Haggai 2:2) 
The Lord of Hosts says this: “This people says that the time has not yet come to rebuild the Lord’s house. But now is the time—the house of the Lord must be rebuilt.”

(Haggai 2:3) 
Then the Son spoke through the prophet Haggai, saying:

(Haggai 2:4) 
“Who among you is left who saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Isn’t it as nothing in your eyes?

(Haggai 2:5) 
“But now, be strong, Zerubbabel,” says the Lord. “And be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,” says the Lord, “and work, because I am with you,” says the Lord of Hosts.

(Haggai 2:6) 
“This is what I promised when you came out of Egypt: My Spirit shall remain among you. Fear not.”

(Haggai 2:7) 
“For the Lord of Hosts says this: 'Once more, I will shake the universe and the earth, the sea and the dry land.'

(Haggai 2:8) 
“'I will shake all the nations, and the desired one of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord of Hosts.

(Haggai 2:9) 
“'The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says the Lord of Hosts.

(Haggai 2:10) 
“The glory of this new house will be greater than the glory of the former house,” says the Lord of Hosts, “and in this place, I will give peace,” says the Lord of Hosts.

(Haggai 2:11) 
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Son spoke through Haggai the prophet, saying:

(Haggai 2:12) 
The Lord of Hosts says this: “Ask the priests about the law, saying:

(Haggai 2:13) 
“‘If a man carries consecrated meat in his garment, and the edge of his garment touches bread, or cooked food, or wine, or oil, or any other food, will it be consecrated?’”

(Haggai 2:14) 
The priests answered, “No.”

(Haggai 2:15) 
Then Haggai said, “If someone unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these things, will they be defiled?” The priests answered, “They will be defiled.”

(Haggai 2:16) 
Then Haggai said, “Such is this people, and such is this nation before Me,” says the Lord, “and such is every work of their hands, and everything they offer there is defiled.”

(Haggai 2:17) 
“But now, consider this from this day forward, before the stones were laid in the temple of the Lord.

(Haggai 2:18) 
“When you went to the winepress to get twenty measures, there were only ten. And when you went to the pool to draw water, you could not, because I had brought a curse on all the works of your hands.”

(Haggai 2:19) 
“I struck you with blight and mildew in all the work of your hands; yet you did not turn to Me,” says the Lord.

(Haggai 2:20) 
“Consider this, from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the Lord’s temple was founded; consider this:

(Haggai 2:21) 
“Is any seed still in the barn? From this day on, I will bless you.”

(Haggai 2:22) 
The Son spoke to Haggai the second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying:

(Haggai 2:23) 
“Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying: ‘I will shake the universe and the earth.

(Haggai 2:24) 
“‘I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots and their riders; the horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.

(Haggai 2:25) 
“‘On that day,’ says the Lord of Hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant,’ says the Lord, ‘and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ says the Lord of Hosts.”

(Zechariah 1:1) 
In the second year of the reign of Darius, in the eighth month, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:

(Zechariah 1:2) 
The Lord was angry with your fathers.

(Zechariah 1:3) 
And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Return to me,” says the Lord of hosts, “and I will return to you,” says the Lord of hosts.’

(Zechariah 1:4) 
Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Turn now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.”’ But they did not listen, nor did they pay attention to me, says the Lord.

(Zechariah 1:5) 
Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

(Zechariah 1:6) 
But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not reach your fathers? So they turned and said, ‘As the Lord of hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and according to our deeds, so he has done to us.’

(Zechariah 1:7) 
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:

(Zechariah 1:8) 
I saw by night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees, which were in the deep; and behind him were red, dappled, and white horses.

(Zechariah 1:9) 
And I said, “What are these, my lord?”

(Zechariah 1:10) 
And the angel who spoke with me said to me, “I will show you what these are.”

(Zechariah 1:11) 
And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees replied, “These are they whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.”

(Zechariah 1:12) 
And they answered the angel of the Lord who spoke to them, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is inhabited and at rest.”

(Zechariah 1:13) 
Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, “O Lord of hosts, how long will you not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?”

(Zechariah 1:14) 
And the Lord answered the angel who spoke with me, good words, words of consolation.

(Zechariah 1:15) 
And the angel who spoke with me said to me, “Cry out, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.”’

(Zechariah 1:16) 
And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was only a little angry, and they have helped to bring about the evil.”

(Zechariah 1:17) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord: “I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion. My house shall be built in it,” says the Lord of hosts, “and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.”

(Zechariah 1:18) 
Cry out again, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “My cities shall yet again abound with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.”’

(Zechariah 1:19) 
And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns.

(Zechariah 1:20) 
And I said to the angel who spoke with me, “What are these?”

(Zechariah 1:21) 
And he answered me, “These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”

(Zechariah 1:22) 
Then the Lord showed me four smiths.

(Zechariah 1:23) 
And I said, “What are these coming to do?” And he said, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one could lift up his head; and these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”

(Zechariah 2:1) 
And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man holding a measuring line in his hand.

(Zechariah 2:2) 
So I asked him, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.”

(Zechariah 2:3) 
Then the angel who was speaking to me went out, and another angel went out to meet him.

(Zechariah 2:4) 
He said to him, “Run, speak to that young man, saying: ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls, because of the multitude of men and animals in it.’

(Zechariah 2:5) 
And I, says the Lord, will be a wall of fire all around her, and I will be glory in the midst of her.”

(Zechariah 2:6) 
O, oh, flee from the land of the north, says the Lord: “For I have scattered you to the four winds, says the Lord.”

(Zechariah 2:7) 
Arise, Zion, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.

(Zechariah 2:8) 
For thus says the Lord of hosts: “After glory He sent me to the nations who plundered you: for he who touches you touches the pupil of My eye.”

(Zechariah 2:9) 
For behold, I will raise My hand against them, and they will be plunder for those who served them: and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me.”

(Zechariah 2:10) 
Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion, for behold, I come, and I will dwell in your midst, says the Lord.

(Zechariah 2:11) 
And many nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and they will be My people: and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.

(Zechariah 2:12) 
And the Lord will take possession of Judah, His portion, in the holy land: and He will yet choose Jerusalem.

(Zechariah 2:13) 
Let all flesh be silent before the Lord: for He is roused from His holy dwelling.”

(Zechariah 3:1) 
The Lord showed me Joshua, the High Priest, standing before the angel of the Lord; and Satan stood at his right hand to accuse him.

(Zechariah 3:2) 
And the Lord said to Satan: "May the Lord rebuke you, Satan! May the Lord rebuke you, Satan, who has chosen Jerusalem. Isn't this man like a brand pulled from the fire?"

(Zechariah 3:3) 
Now, Joshua was dressed in filthy garments. He stood before the angel.

(Zechariah 3:4) 
The angel spoke to those standing before him, saying: "Take off his filthy garments." And he said to Joshua, "Behold, I have removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you in clean garments."

(Zechariah 3:5) 
Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord stood by.

(Zechariah 3:6) 
And the angel of the Lord testified to Joshua, saying:

(Zechariah 3:7) 
"Thus says the Lord of hosts: 'If you walk in my ways, and keep my commandments, you shall judge my house, and you shall also walk in my courts. And I will give you access among those who are standing here.'

(Zechariah 3:8) 
“Hear, Joshua the High Priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for these men are a sign. Behold, I am bringing my servant, the Branch.

(Zechariah 3:9) 
For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua, upon one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its inscription," says the Lord of hosts, "and I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day.

(Zechariah 3:10) 
“In that day,” says the Lord of hosts, “every one will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree.”

(Zechariah 4:1) 
And the angel who was speaking with me came back and roused me, as if he were waking a man from sleep.

(Zechariah 4:2) 
He asked me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a solid gold lampstand, with a bowl at the top. There are seven lamps on the lampstand, each with its own little tube.

(Zechariah 4:3) 
And on each side of the lampstand stand two olive trees, one on the right side of the bowl and one on the left.

(Zechariah 4:4) 
I answered, speaking to the angel who was talking with me, and I said, “What are these, my lord?”

(Zechariah 4:5) 
The angel who was talking with me answered and said to me, “Don’t you know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”

(Zechariah 4:6) 
He answered and spoke to me, saying: “This is the Lord's message to Zerubbabel: ‘It is not by army or by strength, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of hosts.

(Zechariah 4:7) 
Who are you, great mountain, before Zerubbabel? It will be made level ground; and he will bring forth the cornerstone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!”

(Zechariah 4:8) 
Then the Lord's word came to me, saying:

(Zechariah 4:9) 
“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it.’ Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.

(Zechariah 4:10) 
For whoever has despised the day of small things will rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth.

(Zechariah 4:11) 
Then I said, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”

(Zechariah 4:12) 
And for the second time I said, “What are these two olive branches beside the two golden spouts that are pouring out golden oil?”

(Zechariah 4:13) 
He asked me, “Don’t you know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”

(Zechariah 4:14) 
Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand before the Lord of all the earth.”

(Zechariah 5:1) 
I turned, and looked up, and saw: and behold a flying scroll.

(Zechariah 5:2) 
He said to me: “What do you see?” And I said: “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.”

(Zechariah 5:3) 
Then he said to me: “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole earth; because every thief, as it is written, is judged, and everyone who swears falsely, as it is written, will be held as innocent.”

(Zechariah 5:4) 
“I will send it out,” says the Lord of hosts, “and it will enter the house of the thief, and the house of those who swear falsely in my name; and it will stay inside of that house, and consume it, with its timbers and its stones.”

(Zechariah 5:5) 
Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward, and said to me: “Raise your eyes and see what this is going out.”

(Zechariah 5:6) 
I said: “What is it?” And he said: “It is an ephah measure going out.” And he said: “This is their iniquity throughout the whole earth.”

(Zechariah 5:7) 
And behold, a talent of lead was being carried, and behold, a woman was sitting inside of the ephah.

(Zechariah 5:8) 
And he said: “This is wickedness.” And he cast her into the middle of the ephah, and cast the lead weight over its mouth.

(Zechariah 5:9) 
Then I raised my eyes, and saw: and behold, two women were going out, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they carried the ephah between the land and the sky.

(Zechariah 5:10) 
Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are these taking the ephah?”

(Zechariah 5:11) 
And he said to me: “So that a house may be built for it in the land of Shinar, and it may be established, and put there upon its base.”

(Zechariah 6:1) 
Then I turned and looked up, and saw four cosmic powers, rising from between two mountains. These mountains were made of bronze.

(Zechariah 6:2) 
The first chariot had red horses, and the second chariot had black horses,

(Zechariah 6:3) 
the third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot had dappled, strong horses.

(Zechariah 6:4) 
Then I answered, and said to the angel who was speaking with me: “What are these, my Lord?”

(Zechariah 6:5) 
The angel answered, and said to me: “These are the four cosmic powers sent from the heavens. They serve the Lord of all Creation.”

(Zechariah 6:6) 
The black horses went towards the southern land, and the white horses followed them. The dappled horses went towards the sunrise.

(Zechariah 6:7) 
Then they went out, and sought to travel through the land. The angel said: “Go and travel the Earth,” and they went around the earth.

(Zechariah 6:8) 
Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying: “See those who are going to the northern land? They have calmed my spirit in the north.”

(Zechariah 6:9) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Zechariah 6:10) 
“Receive gifts from those who were in captivity from Heldai, and from Tobias, and from Jedaiah, who came from Babylon. You will come on that day, and enter the house of Josiah, son of Zephaniah.

(Zechariah 6:11) 
Take gold and silver, and make crowns, and place them on the head of Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

(Zechariah 6:12) 
Say to him: ‘Thus says the Lord of Hosts: “Behold, the man whose name is the Rising Sun. He will arise where he is, and He will rebuild the Temple of the Lord.

(Zechariah 6:13) 
He will rebuild the Temple of the Lord; He will take glory and sit and rule on His throne, and He will be a priest on His throne, and there will be peace between the two of them.”

(Zechariah 6:14) 
The crowns will be for Heldai, and Tobias, and Jedaiah, and for the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the Temple of the Lord.

(Zechariah 6:15) 
Then those who are far away will come and rebuild in the Temple of the Lord; and you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you listen to the voice of the Lord your God.”

(Zechariah 7:1) 
In the fourth year of King Darius's reign, the Word of the Lord came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Casleu.

(Zechariah 7:2) 
And the people of Bethel sent Sarasar and Regemmelech, and the men who were with them, to pray to the Lord.

(Zechariah 7:3) 
They asked the priests who were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and the prophets, saying: “Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”

(Zechariah 7:4) 
Then the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Zechariah 7:5) 
“Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: ‘When you fasted and wept in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, was it really for Me that you were fasting?’

(Zechariah 7:6) 
And when you ate, and when you drank, weren’t you eating and drinking for your own sakes?

(Zechariah 7:7) 
Did the Lord not give you the same message that He delivered through the prophets who came before, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and prosperous, and when its cities were spread out all around, and the south and the plain were inhabited?”

(Zechariah 7:8) 
And the Word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying:

(Zechariah 7:9) 
“The Lord of hosts has spoken, saying: ‘Administer true justice, and show mercy and compassion, each one to his brother.’”

(Zechariah 7:10) 
“Do not oppress the widow, nor the orphan, nor the stranger, nor the poor; and let no man devise evil in his heart against his brother.”

(Zechariah 7:11) 
But they refused to listen, and they turned a stubborn shoulder, and their ears were stopped so they would not hear.

(Zechariah 7:12) 
They made their hearts as hard as a diamond, so that they would not listen to the Law, and the words that the Lord sent by the hand of the former prophets. Therefore, there came great wrath from the Lord of hosts.

(Zechariah 7:13) 
And it came to pass that just as He called out, and they would not listen, so they will cry out, and I will not listen, says the Lord of hosts.

(Zechariah 7:14) 
And I scattered them among all the nations which they did not know, and the land behind them was desolate as they passed through, and there was no return, and they made the desirable land a desolation.”

(Zechariah 8:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to Zachariah, saying:

(Zechariah 8:2) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘I am passionately concerned for Zion, and I love her very much.’”

(Zechariah 8:3) 
“The Lord says this: ‘I will return to Zion. I will live in the middle of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called “the city of truth,” and the mountain of the Lord of Hosts will be called “the holy mountain.”’

(Zechariah 8:4) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘Old men and old women will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in their hand because of old age.’

(Zechariah 8:5) 
‘And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.’

(Zechariah 8:6) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘It may seem difficult to the remnant of this people at that time, but do you think it will be difficult for me too?’ says the Lord of Hosts?

(Zechariah 8:7) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘I will save my people from the east and the west.’

(Zechariah 8:8) 
‘I will bring them back. They will live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, with truth and justice.’

(Zechariah 8:9) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘Be strong, all of you who hear these words in these days, the days when the foundation of the Lord’s house was laid so that the temple might be built.’

(Zechariah 8:10) 
‘Before those days, there was no pay for people or animals, and there was no peace because of the trouble. I will let every person turn against their neighbor.’

(Zechariah 8:11) 
‘But now, unlike those former days, I will plant the seeds of peace. The vineyard will produce its fruit. The earth will give its harvest, and the sky will give its dew. I will give all these things to the remnant of my people.’

(Zechariah 8:12) 
‘Then it will be: just as you, the house of Judah and the house of Israel, were a curse among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Be strong!’

(Zechariah 8:13) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘Just as I decided to bring disaster upon you, when your ancestors angered me,’ says the Lord, ‘I did not change my mind,’

(Zechariah 8:14) 
‘so now I have decided to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.’

(Zechariah 8:15) 
“These are the things you must do: Speak the truth to each other. Judge fairly and justly in your courts.

(Zechariah 8:16) 
Do not plan evil against each other. Do not love to swear falsely. I hate all these things,” says the Lord.

(Zechariah 8:17) 
The Word of the Lord of Hosts came to me, saying:

(Zechariah 8:18) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become times of joy, gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah. But love truth and peace.’

(Zechariah 8:19) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘People from many cities will come again,’

(Zechariah 8:20) 
and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, ‘Let us go and seek the favor of the Lord and search for the Lord of Hosts. I am going, too.’

(Zechariah 8:21) 
‘Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord of Hosts and to implore the favor of the Lord.’

(Zechariah 8:22) 
“The Lord of Hosts says this: ‘In those days, ten men from every language of the nations will grasp the cloak of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’

(Zechariah 9:1) 
This is the prophecy of the Lord about the land of Hadrach. The Lord's protection will fall on Damascus; the eyes of mankind and of all the tribes of Israel are turned to Him.

(Zechariah 9:2) 
So too will Hadrach and Hamath; and Tyre and Sidon, because those cities have developed great skill.

(Zechariah 9:3) 
Tyre built itself strongholds and amassed wealth as great as dust, and gold as common as the mud of the streets.

(Zechariah 9:4) 
But the Lord will take away her power. He will cast her strength into the sea, and the city will be consumed by fire.

(Zechariah 9:5) 
Ashkelon will see it and fear, and Gaza will be in great pain; Ekron will be terrified, for her hope will be gone. The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will be deserted.

(Zechariah 9:6) 
Foreigners will occupy Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

(Zechariah 9:7) 
I will take away the blood from their mouths and the abominations from between their teeth. Those who remain will belong to the Lord and will become a part of Judah, and Ekron will join as one of the Israelites.

(Zechariah 9:8) 
I will keep my people safe from their enemies, who pass through and return. I will watch over them with my own eyes, and no oppressor will ever come against them again.

(Zechariah 9:9) 
Rejoice greatly, daughter Zion! Shout, daughter Jerusalem! Look, your king is coming to you! He is righteous and brings salvation! He is humble, riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

(Zechariah 9:10) 
I will cut off the chariots of Ephraim and the horses of Jerusalem, and the bows of war will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations; his dominion will extend from sea to sea and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.

(Zechariah 9:11) 
Because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to your stronghold, you prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore twice as much to you.

(Zechariah 9:12) 
Return to your stronghold, you prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore twice as much to you.

(Zechariah 9:13) 
I will bend Judah as my bow, and I will fit the arrow of Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece; I will make you like a warrior’s sword.

(Zechariah 9:14) 
Then the Lord will appear over them; his arrow will be like lightning. The Lord God will sound the trumpet and will march in the storms of the south.

(Zechariah 9:15) 
The Lord of Hosts will protect them. They will eat and will trample the sling stones; they will drink and roar as if drunk with wine; they will be filled with blood like bowls, like the corners of the altar.

(Zechariah 9:16) 
On that day the Lord their God will save them, like the flock of his people. For they will be like the jewels of a crown, gleaming over his land.

(Zechariah 9:17) 
How beautiful and good they are, the grain of the elect, and the new wine that makes virgins flourish!

(Zechariah 10:1) 
Beseech the Lord, and He will give rain at the appointed time: then the Lord will make the clouds gather, and He will give them food in the field.

(Zechariah 10:2) 
False gods speak empty words; the soothsayers have seen lies and spoken in vain; they console in vain. Therefore, they have wandered away like sheep, and are afflicted because there is no shepherd.

(Zechariah 10:3) 
My wrath is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders. For the Lord of hosts will visit His flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as a glorious horse in battle.

(Zechariah 10:4) 
From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the peg, from him the bow of war. From him, will the strength of all of them come forth.

(Zechariah 10:5) 
And they shall be as mighty men, trampling the mire of the streets in battle, and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them.

(Zechariah 10:6) 
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will restore them, because I will have mercy on them, and they shall be as they were before I had cast them off. For I am the Lord their God, and I will hear them.

(Zechariah 10:7) 
And Ephraim shall be as a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as if with wine, and their children shall see it, and shall rejoice, and their heart shall be glad in the Lord.

(Zechariah 10:8) 
I will whistle for them, and I will gather them, because I have redeemed them, and I will multiply them as before.

(Zechariah 10:9) 
And I will disperse them among the peoples, and in distant lands they will remember Me, and they shall live with their children, and shall turn back to Me.

(Zechariah 10:10) 
And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them from Assyria, and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and there will be no room for them.

(Zechariah 10:11) 
And they shall pass through the sea of tribulation, and He shall strike down the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river shall be dried up, and the pride of Assyria shall be taken away, and the scepter of Egypt.

(Zechariah 10:12) 
And I will strengthen them in the Lord, and in His name they shall rejoice, says the Lord.

(Zechariah 11:1) 
Open your gates, Lebanon, so the fire will devour your cedars.

(Zechariah 11:2) 
Howl, fir tree, because the cedar has fallen. The mighty are ruined. Howl, oaks of Bashan, because the impenetrable forest has been cut down.

(Zechariah 11:3) 
Listen to the shepherds' cries of grief, because their glory is ruined. Listen to the lions' roaring, because the pride of the Jordan is ruined.

(Zechariah 11:4) 
Thus says the Lord, my God: "Shepherd the flock that is being slaughtered.

(Zechariah 11:5) 
Those who possessed them killed them without regret. Those who sold them said, 'Blessed is the Lord, for we have become rich!' and their shepherds show them no pity.

(Zechariah 11:6) 
Because I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, behold, I will cause men to fall into the hands of their neighbors and into the hands of their kings. They will crush the land, and I will not deliver it from their hands."

(Zechariah 11:7) 
So I shepherded the flock that was being slaughtered, that is, the poor of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: one I named Favor, and the other I named Union. And I tended the flock.

(Zechariah 11:8) 
I dismissed the three shepherds in one month. My soul became impatient with them, and their souls also detested me.

(Zechariah 11:9) 
Then I said, "I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and those who are perishing, perish. Let those who are left devour each other's flesh!"

(Zechariah 11:10) 
Then I took my staff, Favor, and I broke it, because I was breaking the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.

(Zechariah 11:11) 
So it was broken on that day, and the poor of the flock, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the Lord.

(Zechariah 11:12) 
Then I said to them, "If it seems right to you, give me my wages; and if not, keep them." So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.

(Zechariah 11:13) 
And the Lord said to me, "Throw it to the potter”—the price at which they valued me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter.

(Zechariah 11:14) 
Then I broke my second staff, Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

(Zechariah 11:15) 
And the Lord said to me: "Take for yourself again the instruments of a worthless shepherd.

(Zechariah 11:16) 
For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not care for the lost, nor seek the scattered, nor heal the injured, nor feed the healthy. He will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves.

(Zechariah 11:17) 
Woe to the worthless shepherd, who abandons the flock! May a sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be utterly withered, and his right eye become utterly dark!"

(Zechariah 12:1) 
This is what the Lord said about the future of the earth. The Lord has set His judgment against the land of Hadrach, and He will bring His rest on Damascus. All of humankind, and all the tribes of Israel, will turn toward the Lord.

(Zechariah 12:2) 
The Lord will also judge Hamath. And the Lord will bring down Tyre and Sidon, along with their wisdom.

(Zechariah 12:3) 
Tyre has built fortresses to protect itself. The people have stored up silver like dirt and gold like mud in the streets.

(Zechariah 12:4) 
The Lord will defeat it, and destroy its power in the sea. And the city of Tyre will be consumed by fire.

(Zechariah 12:5) 
Ashkelon will see the destruction and be afraid. And Gaza will be in agony. And Ekron will be ashamed, for it was wrong to put its hope in itself. And the king of Gaza will be destroyed, and Ashkelon will be deserted.

(Zechariah 12:6) 
Foreigners will live in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

(Zechariah 12:7) 
I will take away the blood from their mouths, and the evil things they eat from their teeth. And their remaining people will belong to the Lord, and they will be like a tribal chief in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.

(Zechariah 12:8) 
I will set up My camp to protect My house from the army that comes and goes, and no oppressor will ever pass through them again, for I have seen this with My own eyes.

(Zechariah 12:9) 
Daughter of Zion, be joyful and proclaim the good news! Daughter of Jerusalem, shout! Behold, your king is coming to you, just and victorious! He is meek and riding on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

(Zechariah 12:10) 
I will remove the chariots from Ephraim, and the horses from Jerusalem, and the weapons of war will be broken. And the king will speak peace to the nations, and his power will stretch from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

(Zechariah 12:11) 
I am the one who liberated your prisoners from the waterless pit because of the blood of My covenant.

(Zechariah 12:12) 
Return to your fortress, you prisoners who still have hope. Even today, I will tell you that I will restore to you double what you have lost.

(Zechariah 12:13) 
I will use Judah as My bow. I will fill it with Ephraim like an arrow. I will rouse up your sons, O Zion, against the sons of Greece. And I will make you like a warrior's sword.

(Zechariah 12:14) 
Then the Lord will appear over them. And His arrow will flash like lightning. The Lord God will blow the trumpet. And He will go forth in the tempests of the south.

(Zechariah 12:15) 
The Lord of hosts will protect them. They will eat and will trample on the sling stones. They will drink, and they will be drunk as if they had drunk wine. They will be filled as a bowl is filled, and as the corners of the altar are filled.

(Zechariah 12:16) 
The Lord their God will save them on that day, as the flock of His people, because they are like precious stones. They will shine forth over the land of God.

(Zechariah 12:17) 
How good and beautiful they will be! The grain of the chosen ones will flourish, and the wine will cause young women to grow.

(Zechariah 13:1) 
At that time, a fountain will gush forth for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to wash away sin and impurity.

(Zechariah 13:2) 
On that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will destroy the idols from the land. They will never be remembered again. I will take away the false prophets and the spirit of uncleanness from the land.

(Zechariah 13:3) 
If anyone dares to prophesy again, his father and mother, who brought him forth, will say, “You will not live, because you have spoken falsely in the name of the Lord.” His father and mother, who bore him, will pierce him through when he prophesies.

(Zechariah 13:4) 
On that day, the prophets will be ashamed of their visions when they prophesy. They will not wear a hairy cloak to deceive others,

(Zechariah 13:5) 
But rather say, “I am not a prophet; I am a farmer. The land is my inheritance.”

(Zechariah 13:6) 
And if someone asks, “What are these wounds on your body?”, they will reply, “I got these wounds in the house of my friends.”

(Zechariah 13:7) 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my associate, says the Lord of hosts. Strike the shepherd, that the sheep may be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.

(Zechariah 13:8) 
In all the land, says the Lord, two parts in it will perish and be consumed, but the third part will be left in it.

(Zechariah 13:9) 
I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will hear them. I will say, “They are my people,” and they will say, “The Lord is my God.”

(Zechariah 14:1) 
Behold, the day of the Lord will come, and all the treasures you have will be scattered in your midst.

(Zechariah 14:2) 
I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem for war, and the city will be captured, and the houses will be destroyed, and the women will be raped. Half of the city will be led away into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be taken out of the city.

(Zechariah 14:3) 
Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as He fought in the day of battle.

(Zechariah 14:4) 
On that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is east of Jerusalem. The Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a very large valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half toward the south.

(Zechariah 14:5) 
You will flee into the valley of my mountains, because the valley of the mountains will reach to Azal. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the saints with Him.

(Zechariah 14:6) 
On that day there will be no light, but there will be cold and frost.

(Zechariah 14:7) 
It will be a unique day that is known to the Lord, neither day nor night, but at evening time there will be light.

(Zechariah 14:8) 
On that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea; they will flow in both summer and winter.

(Zechariah 14:9) 
And the Lord will be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord will be one, and His name one.

(Zechariah 14:10) 
The whole land will be turned into a plain, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be raised up and inhabited in its place, from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the king's wine presses.

(Zechariah 14:11) 
People will live in it, and there will be no more curse, but Jerusalem will be secure.

(Zechariah 14:12) 
This will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.

(Zechariah 14:13) 
On that day a great panic from the Lord will fall on them, so that each one will seize the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will be raised against the hand of his neighbor.

(Zechariah 14:14) 
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem, and all the nations will be gathered against her.

(Zechariah 14:15) 
This will be the plague that strikes the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the animals that are in those camps. The same plague will be on all who enter Jerusalem: their flesh will be consumed, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.

(Zechariah 14:16) 
On that day, even the bells on the horses will be inscribed with “holy to the Lord.” The cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like the bowls before the altar.

(Zechariah 14:17) 
Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord of hosts, and all who sacrifice will come and take some of the pots to cook in. On that day, there will no longer be any traders in the house of the Lord of hosts.

(Zechariah 14:18) 
On that day, it will be written on the bells of the horses: “Holy to the Lord.” The cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like the bowls before the altar.

(Zechariah 14:19) 
Every one who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

(Zechariah 14:20) 
If any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no rain for them.

(Zechariah 14:21) 
And if the family of Egypt does not go up and come, there will be no rain for them; there will be the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

(Zechariah 14:22) 
This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

(Zechariah 14:23) 
On that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to the Lord.” The cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like the bowls before the altar.

(Malachi 1:1) 
This is the message from God, spoken to Israel through Malachi.

(Malachi 1:2) 
“I have loved you,” says God. But you say: “How have you loved us?” “Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?” says God. “I loved Jacob,

(Malachi 1:3) 
but I rejected Esau. I made his mountains into desolate wastelands, and turned his inheritance over to desert jackals.”

(Malachi 1:4) 
If the people of Edom say: “We are ruined, but we will rebuild the ruins,” then God says: “They may rebuild, but I will tear it down again. And they will be called ‘the territory of wickedness,’ and ‘the people whom God hates forever.’”

(Malachi 1:5) 
Your eyes will see this, and you will say, “God's glory extends beyond the borders of Israel!”

(Malachi 1:6) 
A son honors his father, and a servant honors his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due to me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due to me?” says God. “You priests despise my name, but you ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’”

(Malachi 1:7) 
You bring polluted food to my altar and ask, “How have we polluted you?” By saying, “God's table is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:8) 
When you offer a blind animal as a sacrifice, is that not evil? When you offer a lame or diseased animal, is that not evil? Offer it to your governor! Would he accept you or show you favor?” says God.

(Malachi 1:9) 
Now, plead with God for mercy! Because of your actions, will he accept your offerings?

(Malachi 1:10) 
Who among you will close the doors so that you do not light a useless fire on my altar? I have no pleasure in you,” says God, “and I will accept no offering from your hand.

(Malachi 1:11) 
From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is honored among the nations. In every place, incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering is made to me, because my name is great among the nations,” says God.

(Malachi 1:12) 
But you profane it by saying, “God’s table is polluted, and its food is contemptible.”

(Malachi 1:13) 
You also say, “How tedious!” And you turn up your noses at it,” says God. “You bring what you have stolen, what is lame or diseased, and offer it as a sacrifice. Should I accept it from your hands?” says God.

(Malachi 1:14) 
Cursed is the deceiver who has a male in his flock, but vows to sacrifice a defective animal to God. For I am a great king,” says God, “and my name is feared among the nations.”

(Malachi 2:1) 
And now, priests, this is your mission.

(Malachi 2:2) 
If you do not listen to this command, and if you do not give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, I will send a famine among you. And I will curse your blessings, and I have already cursed them, because you have not taken this to heart.

(Malachi 2:3) 
Behold, I will rebuke you, and I will scatter your waste on your faces, the waste of your feast days. And you will be taken away with it.

(Malachi 2:4) 
And you will know that I have sent this mission to you, to fulfill my covenant with Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:5) 
My covenant with him was for life and peace, and I gave him reverence, and he reverenced me, and he feared my name.

(Malachi 2:6) 
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and equity, and he turned many away from iniquity.

(Malachi 2:7) 
For the lips of the priest guard knowledge, and they seek the law from his mouth, because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:8) 
But you have turned away from the way, and you have caused many to stumble in the law. You have destroyed the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:9) 
Therefore I also have made you contemptible and abject before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have accepted faces in the law.

(Malachi 2:10) 
Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why, then, do you despise your brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?

(Malachi 2:11) 
Judah has acted treacherously, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and has fallen into it.

(Malachi 2:12) 
May the Lord cut off the man who does this: who watches and answers from the tents of Jacob, and who offers an offering to the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 2:13) 
And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, and weeping, and wailing, so that I no longer look at the sacrifice, nor do I accept it with favor from your hand.

(Malachi 2:14) 
And you said: Why? Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised. For she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.

(Malachi 2:15) 
Did He not make one flesh, and has the remnant of His Spirit? And why does He seek one flesh? And seeking the seed of God. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not despise the wife of your youth.

(Malachi 2:16) 
If you hate her, put her away, says the Lord God of Israel: for iniquity shall cover your iniquity, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore, guard your spirit, and do not act treacherously.

(Malachi 2:17) 
You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you said: How have we wearied Him? In that you say: Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such things are pleasing to Him. Or, where is the God of justice?

(Malachi 3:1) 
I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And suddenly the Master you seek will come, and the angel of the covenant you desire. Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:2) 
Who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' herb.

(Malachi 3:3) 
He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will make offerings to the Lord in righteousness.

(Malachi 3:4) 
Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years.

(Malachi 3:5) 
I will come to you for judgment. I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who oppress the wage earner, the widow, and the orphan, and those who turn aside the stranger, and do not fear Me, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:6) 
For I am the Lord, and I do not change. Therefore, you, the sons of Jacob, are not consumed.

(Malachi 3:7) 
From the days of your fathers you have turned away from My ordinances and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you said, ‘How shall we return?’

(Malachi 3:8) 
Will a man rob God? Yet you rob Me. But you say, ‘In what do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.

(Malachi 3:9) 
You are cursed, because you rob Me, the whole nation of you.

(Malachi 3:10) 
Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this, says the Lord of hosts. See if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing for you until there is no room enough to receive it.

(Malachi 3:11) 
I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your ground, and the vine in your field shall not be barren, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:12) 
Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 3:13) 
Your words have been harsh against Me, says the Lord. But you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’

(Malachi 3:14) 
You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance and that we have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts?’

(Malachi 3:15) 
So now we call the arrogant blessed. For those who do wickedness are built up; they have tempted God and are saved.

(Malachi 3:16) 
Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another. The Lord paid attention and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and esteem His name.

(Malachi 3:17) 
They will be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day that I am making, and they will be My special possession. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.

(Malachi 3:18) 
Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not serve Him.

(Malachi 4:1) 
Behold, the day is coming, it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and everyone who practices wickedness will be like straw. The coming day will consume them, says the Lord of hosts, leaving them neither root nor branch.

(Malachi 4:2) 
But for you who fear My name, the Son of justice will rise, and salvation will be under His wings. You will leave the darkness and leap about with joy, like calves from the stall.

(Malachi 4:3) 
Then you will trample upon the wicked, they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I act, says the Lord of hosts.

(Malachi 4:4) 
Remember the law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel, the precepts and judgments.

(Malachi 4:5) 
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.

(Malachi 4:6) 
He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a curse.

(1 Maccabees 1:1) 
After Alexander of Macedon, son of Philip, the first to reign over Greece, defeated many kings and then left the land of Kittim,

(1 Maccabees 1:2) 
he fought many wars against King Darius of Persia and Media,

(1 Maccabees 1:3) 
and he conquered fortresses and killed the kings of the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:4) 
He went to the ends of the earth, seizing plunder from many nations, and the earth was quiet before him.

(1 Maccabees 1:5) 
Alexander became arrogant, and his heart was lifted up.

(1 Maccabees 1:6) 
He gathered a very strong army and ruled over the region, the nations, and the kings.

(1 Maccabees 1:7) 
He died, and he realized that he was about to die.

(1 Maccabees 1:8) 
He called his servants, who were noble and had been raised with him since his youth, and he divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.

(1 Maccabees 1:9) 
Alexander reigned for twelve years, and then he died.

(1 Maccabees 1:10) 
His servants divided his kingdom, taking power, and they all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years: and evil increased in the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:11) 
Then came forth a sinful root, Antiochus, called Epiphanes, son of King Antiochus, who had been a hostage in Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

(1 Maccabees 1:12) 
In those days, some wicked men of Israel went out and persuaded many, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles around us. For since we separated ourselves from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 1:13) 
This speech pleased them.

(1 Maccabees 1:14) 
They sent word to King Antiochus, and he gave them authority to follow the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 1:15) 
They built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the nations,

(1 Maccabees 1:16) 
and they made themselves uncircumcised, and they abandoned the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the Gentiles, and were sold to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 1:17) 
The kingdom of Antiochus was prepared, and he gathered a very strong army, and entered into the land of Egypt, to reign over it.

(1 Maccabees 1:18) 
He came into Egypt with a multitude, with chariots, elephants, horsemen, and many ships,

(1 Maccabees 1:19) 
and he made war against Ptolemy, the king of Egypt: and Ptolemy was afraid before him, and fled.

(1 Maccabees 1:20) 
He seized the fortified cities in the land of Egypt and plundered the land of Egypt.

(1 Maccabees 1:21) 
Antiochus struck Egypt in the one hundred and forty-third year, and then he went up to Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:22) 
He went up to Jerusalem with a strong army.

(1 Maccabees 1:23) 
He entered the sanctuary with arrogance, and took the golden altar, and the lampstand of light, and all its vessels.

(1 Maccabees 1:24) 
He took the table of the bread of the Presence, the vessels for libations, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the golden ornament that was on the facade of the temple: and he plundered it all.

(1 Maccabees 1:25) 
He took silver, gold, and the precious vessels; and he found the hidden treasure.

(1 Maccabees 1:26) 
Taking it all, he went back to his own land, where he committed slaughter, and spoke great wickedness.

(1 Maccabees 1:27) 
There was great mourning in Israel and in all their places.

(1 Maccabees 1:28) 
The leaders and the elders groaned, the young men and maidens languished, and the beauty of the women was changed.

(1 Maccabees 1:29) 
Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and the bride was, as it were, in mourning.

(1 Maccabees 1:30) 
The earth shook over its inhabitants, and the whole house of Jacob was covered with confusion.

(1 Maccabees 1:31) 
After two years, the king sent the chief tax collector into the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude.

(1 Maccabees 1:32) 
He spoke to them with deceitful words of peace, and they believed him: and he suddenly attacked the city, and struck it with a great plague, and destroyed many people of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:33) 
He plundered the city, and burned it with fire, and demolished its houses, and its walls around it.

(1 Maccabees 1:34) 
He took captive the women and children, and possessed the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 1:35) 
They built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and strong towers, and it became a citadel for them:

(1 Maccabees 1:36) 
and they placed there a sinful people, wicked men, and they strengthened themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 1:37) 
They put treasure in it, and made a secret place, and they became a trap for the people of Israel always, and those who lay in wait for the sanctuary.

(1 Maccabees 1:38) 
They shed innocent blood around the sanctuary and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:39) 
The inhabitants feared them, and the dwelling became the dwelling of the Gentiles, and it became foreign to the people, and they were driven out, and withdrew from their sons.

(1 Maccabees 1:40) 
They took away the glory of the temple, and took away its vessels, and they burned its holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:41) 
They gave the cities of Judah to destruction.

(1 Maccabees 1:42) 
And they came to Jerusalem, and strangers lived there, and they drove out the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:43) 
They defiled the holy things, and put idols in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 1:44) 
And they sent word around to all parts of Judah, and brought out those who were not wicked, and gathered an army.

(1 Maccabees 1:45) 
And they came to the city, and took it, and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:46) 
And they did evil around the sanctuary, and the Gentiles did too.

(1 Maccabees 1:47) 
And all the nations agreed, and gave him power.

(1 Maccabees 1:48) 
And they did in Jerusalem according to the customs of the Gentiles, according to idols, and they did not cause danger.

(1 Maccabees 1:49) 
And they placed idols in the temple, and burned the temple with fire.

(1 Maccabees 1:50) 
They shed the blood of the just, and turned their prayers into blood.

(1 Maccabees 1:51) 
And all the people who were around, helped them.

(1 Maccabees 1:52) 
And the king commanded his whole land, that all should be one people, and that everyone should abandon their own law.

(1 Maccabees 1:53) 
And all the Gentiles agreed according to the king's word.

(1 Maccabees 1:54) 
And many of Israel submitted to his servitude, and sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 1:55) 
And the king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah, that they should follow the laws of the Gentiles of the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:56) 
and that they should forbid the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and libations in the sanctification of the temple,

(1 Maccabees 1:57) 
and that they should profane the sabbaths and solemnities,

(1 Maccabees 1:58) 
and contaminate the holy things and the holy days.

(1 Maccabees 1:59) 
And that they should build altars, shrines, and idols, and sacrifice pigs and unclean animals,

(1 Maccabees 1:60) 
and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, and defile their souls in all things unclean and abominable,

(1 Maccabees 1:61) 
that they should put their souls in all worship of idols, and forget the holy name.

(1 Maccabees 1:62) 
And whoever does not act according to the king's word, shall die.

(1 Maccabees 1:63) 
He wrote all these things in his whole land, and appointed officials over all the people, and commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 1:64) 
Then many of the people, who had forsaken the law of the Lord, went over to them, and did evil in the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:65) 
and led Israel into hiding.

(1 Maccabees 2:1) 
Some time later, Mattathias, son of John, son of Simon, a priest from the family of Joarib, left Jerusalem upon hearing that many from Judah and Jerusalem were turning away from God.

(1 Maccabees 2:2) 
The Jews were committing wicked acts in the land of Israel, and had shown great disrespect in Jerusalem, following the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:3) 
Mattathias and his sons said: “Woe to us! Why have we been born? What has happened to us?

(1 Maccabees 2:4) 
The sacred vessels were taken and scattered, our sons are lost, and the sons of Zion have been murdered by our enemies.

(1 Maccabees 2:5) 
Glory has been taken from us, and the kingdom and the sanctity of God are overthrown; we are now like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:6) 
Why then do we delay?

(1 Maccabees 2:7) 
So all of the people gathered around them.

(1 Maccabees 2:8) 
They gathered in a place called Mizpah, near Jerusalem, because it was a place of prayer in Israel.

(1 Maccabees 2:9) 
Jonathan, son of Mattathias, and his sons said to their brothers: “Now our enemies are united, and the Gentiles have turned against us.

(1 Maccabees 2:10) 
Come, let us strengthen our people, and fight for our people and for our holy things.”

(1 Maccabees 2:11) 
So the whole army was gathered, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 2:12) 
Then Mattathias said: “Listen, you who are zealous for the law, so that you may do justice and righteousness in your days.

(1 Maccabees 2:13) 
Follow me.

(1 Maccabees 2:14) 
Our brothers are dead, scattered throughout the land, because of the wicked deeds of the evildoers: and we are like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:15) 
So gather yourselves, and let us fight for our lives.”

(1 Maccabees 2:16) 
Then the whole army gathered on that day, and they held a meeting on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:17) 
They said to them: “Why is it that you all left, and are sitting still?

(1 Maccabees 2:18) 
The men of the Gentiles said: “Let us go and do as the king has commanded, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 2:19) 
They replied to them: “We will not do it, nor will we obey the king’s command, nor will we depart from our religion, nor from any part of our works.”

(1 Maccabees 2:20) 
Then they stopped fighting.

(1 Maccabees 2:21) 
Many Israelites agreed with the wicked deeds, and they sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:22) 
Then Mattathias and his sons said: “If we all do as our brothers did, and do not fight for our lives, for our righteousness, and for our holy things,

(1 Maccabees 2:23) 
everyone will kill us on the Sabbaths.”

(1 Maccabees 2:24) 
So they gathered against them: and fought with them: and killed them on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:25) 
While they were pursuing them on the Sabbaths, they came upon them with great force.

(1 Maccabees 2:26) 
They killed them on that day, and with the wicked, and did not count them.

(1 Maccabees 2:27) 
Mattathias and his friends dressed, and they ran throughout the entire city, and destroyed the altars of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 2:28) 
They circumcised the boys who were found uncircumcised in the borders of Israel, according to the law.

(1 Maccabees 2:29) 
And they pursued the sons of the proud, and the work prospered in their hands.

(1 Maccabees 2:30) 
They gained the law from the hand of the Gentiles, and from the hand of the kings, and they did not give a place to sinners.

(1 Maccabees 2:31) 
The day of Mattathias’s death approached: and he said to his sons: “Now pride, punishment, the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation are established.

(1 Maccabees 2:32) 
Now therefore, sons, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.

(1 Maccabees 2:33) 
And he responded, saying: “Behold, Simon your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel: always listen to him, and he will be a father to you.”

(1 Maccabees 2:34) 
And Judas Maccabaeus, strong from his youth, will be the leader of the army for you, and he will wage war against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:35) 
And bring to yourselves all those who keep the law, and take vengeance on your people.

(1 Maccabees 2:36) 
Repay the Gentiles their retribution, and pay attention to the commandments of the law.”

(1 Maccabees 2:37) 
Then Mattathias died: and his sons buried him in the tombs of their fathers in Modein, and all Israel mourned for him with great mourning.

(1 Maccabees 3:1) 
In those days, Antiochus, the son of King Antiochus, departed from Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year.

(1 Maccabees 3:2) 
In those days, the sons of iniquity went out from Israel and persuaded many people, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles who are around us. Because since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 3:3) 
And this word seemed good in their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 3:4) 
And they appointed some of the people and sent them to the king, and the king gave them authority to do according to the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:5) 
And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, following the laws of the nations:

(1 Maccabees 3:6) 
they circumcised themselves, abandoned the holy covenant, allied themselves with the Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 3:7) 
And as the kingdom grew stronger, Antiochus sent to Jerusalem, to the city, to crush it.

(1 Maccabees 3:8) 
And he entered it with a great multitude, took the city, and inflicted a great slaughter in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:9) 
And he commanded his angels to do it, and they went out and struck the men in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:10) 
And they shed the blood of the just and defiled the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:11) 
And they seized the spoils of the city, burned it with fire, and destroyed its houses and walls all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:12) 
And they took women and children captive and took possession of the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 3:13) 
And they built a wall around the city of David, great and strong, and strong towers, and it became a fortress for them.

(1 Maccabees 3:14) 
And they placed a sinful people and wicked men there, and they fortified themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:15) 
And they imposed an unjust temple, and every nation that was there, with evil works.

(1 Maccabees 3:16) 
And they took away the continual sacrifice and the sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 3:17) 
And they set up the abomination of desolation in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:18) 
And they built altars in the cities of Judah all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:19) 
And they sacrificed at the gates of houses and in the streets.

(1 Maccabees 3:20) 
And they burned the books of the law with fire, which they had found.

(1 Maccabees 3:21) 
And they killed anyone they found possessing the testament and observing the law, by the king's command.

(1 Maccabees 3:22) 
And they acted with their might in Jerusalem, and in the months, and in the days.

(1 Maccabees 3:23) 
And they sent to Beria with great violence, to fill Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:24) 
And on the twenty-fifth day of the month, they sacrificed on the altar of idols, which was above the altar of the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:25) 
And they killed the women who had circumcised their sons, according to the command, and they hanged their sons by the neck.

(1 Maccabees 3:26) 
And many of Israel resolved within themselves and determined not to eat anything unclean.

(1 Maccabees 3:27) 
And they chose death rather than be defiled and not pollute the holy covenant; and they died.

(1 Maccabees 3:28) 
And great wrath came upon Israel.

(1 Maccabees 3:29) 
In those days, Mattathias, the son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, arose and settled in the city of Modin.

(1 Maccabees 3:30) 
And he had five sons: John, and Simon, who was called Thassi, and Judas, who was called Maccabaeus.

(1 Maccabees 3:31) 
And Eleazar, and Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 3:32) 
And he saw the zeal and iniquities that were happening in Judah and Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:33) 
And he said: “Woe is me! Why was I born to see this? I am grieved by the destruction of my people, and I am grieved by the destruction of the holy place, and I have been delivered into the hands of foreigners.”

(1 Maccabees 3:34) 
And he gathered all of his belongings, and they went out into the desert, where they left their sons and their wives.

(1 Maccabees 3:35) 
And they went out with their sons and fought in the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:36) 
And Antiochus the king sent troops to force those who were left to come down and transgress.

(1 Maccabees 3:37) 
And they said to Mattathias: “You are the son of a prince, and you are great and noble in this city, and here is a gathering, and the Gentiles who are around are at your service.

(1 Maccabees 3:38) 
Come, therefore, first, and do the king’s command, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah have done, and those who remained in Jerusalem. And you and your sons will be in the number of the king's friends, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”

(1 Maccabees 3:39) 
And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice: “Even if all the Gentiles who are in the king’s kingdom have listened to him and have departed from the worship of their fathers and have chosen his desires.

(1 Maccabees 3:40) 
I and my sons and my brothers will walk in the covenant of our fathers.

(1 Maccabees 3:41) 
May it be far from us that we should forsake the law and its judgments.

(1 Maccabees 3:42) 
We will not obey the words of the king, nor will we transgress our worship, neither to the right nor to the left.”

(1 Maccabees 3:43) 
And when he had finished speaking these words, a certain Jew approached in the sight of all, to sacrifice to idols in the city of Modin, according to the king’s command.

(1 Maccabees 3:44) 
And Mattathias saw this, and he was inflamed with zeal, and his loins trembled, and he was moved to indignation according to judgment, and he rushed forward and struck him on the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:45) 
And also the man who was carrying out the king's command, he struck in the same hour, and they destroyed the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:46) 
And they were zealous for the law, as Phinehas did with Zambri the son of Salomi.

(1 Maccabees 3:47) 
And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: “Whoever has zeal for the law and keeps the statutes, let him come out after me.”

(1 Maccabees 3:48) 
And he and his sons fled into the mountains and left all that they had in the city.

(1 Maccabees 3:49) 
Then many went down, seeking judgment and justice, to go into the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:50) 
And they lived there, they and their sons and their wives and their livestock because evils had abounded upon them.

(1 Maccabees 3:51) 
And this word was announced to King Antiochus, and he was angry, and he gathered all his army and said: “I know that the Jews have departed from me and do not do what I want, but they have been led by me into their laws.”

(1 Maccabees 3:52) 
And he sent an army to them, with a multitude, to destroy them.

(1 Maccabees 3:53) 
And the army went out against them and approached them and encamped against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:54) 
And they said to them: “Now we will do to you: Go out and do according to the word of the king, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 3:55) 
They said: “We will not go out, nor will we do the word of the king, nor will we transgress the Sabbath day.”

(1 Maccabees 3:56) 
And they gave them battle quickly.

(1 Maccabees 3:57) 
And they did not respond to them, nor did they throw a stone, nor did they obstruct their places, saying, “Let us all die in our innocence.”

(1 Maccabees 3:58) 
And they gathered against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:59) 
And they died, with their wives and their sons and their livestock, and they descended to a thousand souls.

(1 Maccabees 3:60) 
And Mattathias and his friends knew this and mourned them greatly.

(1 Maccabees 3:61) 
And they said, man to his neighbor: “If we all do as our brothers did and do not fight for our souls and our justifications, we will all be surrendered in a short time.

(1 Maccabees 3:62) 
And they resolved on that day, saying: “Whoever comes against us in battle on the Sabbath, we will fight against him, and we will not all die as our brothers died in secret places.”

(1 Maccabees 3:63) 
Then war was added to them from the side of the Asidaeans and the strong men of Israel, all who willingly offered themselves to the law.

(1 Maccabees 3:64) 
And all the Israelites who were fleeing from the evils added help to them and strengthened them.

(1 Maccabees 3:65) 
And the army gathered and struck the sinners in their anger and the wicked men in their indignation, and the rest fled to the Gentiles to preserve themselves.

(1 Maccabees 3:66) 
And Mattathias and his friends went around and destroyed the altars.

(1 Maccabees 3:67) 
And they circumcised the infant boys, whom they found in the borders of Israel, whoever they found.

(1 Maccabees 3:68) 
And they struck the sons of the arrogant.

(1 Maccabees 3:69) 
And they completed the work with their own hand, and they took vengeance in the hands of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:70) 
And the days which they completed and gave for the law are glorious.

(1 Maccabees 4:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-eighth year, the kings left Syria and entered the land of Judah.

(1 Maccabees 4:2) 
And Judas selected men, and sent soldiers, and fought against them: and killed about three thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:3) 
And the army of the Jews gathered, and they came to Gophna: and went away.

(1 Maccabees 4:4) 
Then the enemies of the Jews gathered, and came together as one: and went out as though to ascend to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:5) 
And Judas heard, he went out with ten men with him.

(1 Maccabees 4:6) 
And they fought bravely, and struck down about thirty men of the army: and they returned.

(1 Maccabees 4:7) 
And their enemies saw that the Jews were attacking them, and went out of the fields, and withdrew to the road, where they were.

(1 Maccabees 4:8) 
And the Jews gathered and came to Bethsura: and fought against them throughout the day.

(1 Maccabees 4:9) 
And they rose up in the day, and gave their hands to their men, and were in the same place.

(1 Maccabees 4:10) 
And they went out of Bethsura, and came to the camps of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:11) 
And it happened on that day, that Achima, son of Calami, entered from the camps of the Tyrians.

(1 Maccabees 4:12) 
And in that place they killed Achima, and his brothers: and they were slain.

(1 Maccabees 4:13) 
And Judas and his army gathered, and ascended to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:14) 
And he placed a garrison there, and commanded them to guard it.

(1 Maccabees 4:15) 
And Judas took and chose men, and sent them to Joppa, a city by the sea, to cast out those who were there of his people.

(1 Maccabees 4:16) 
And coming, he took the port, and killed those who were there: and left the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:17) 
And knowing that Judas was approaching, they feared: and they shut the gates, and were afraid.

(1 Maccabees 4:18) 
And Judas sent, and they seized them.

(1 Maccabees 4:19) 
And he crushed them with the sword, those who were in the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:20) 
And he took Joppa, and all the ports of Judea, and from the tribes, and came to Gaza.

(1 Maccabees 4:21) 
And those who were in Gaza came and shut themselves in.

(1 Maccabees 4:22) 
And Judas besieged it, and gave them plunder, and burned its walls.

(1 Maccabees 4:23) 
And they took a great amount of plunder from Gaza, and from its borders, and from all its villages that were in the surrounding area.

(1 Maccabees 4:24) 
And Judas took his army, and came to Ascalon: and there, in the fields, he adored their idols.

(1 Maccabees 4:25) 
And he turned away, and led his army away, and shouting, they returned to Judea with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:26) 
And they ascended Mount Zion with great joy and gladness: and they offered burnt offerings, because they had not perished from their enemies.

(1 Maccabees 4:27) 
And they celebrated the purification of the temple for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with joy, and sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 4:28) 
And they adorned the temple, and the courts, and sanctified the court.

(1 Maccabees 4:29) 
And they made lights on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is Chasalew.

(1 Maccabees 4:30) 
And they established by decree, to all the people of the Jews, that they should celebrate these days, every year.

(1 Maccabees 4:31) 
And in that time, Antiochus Epiphanes rose up and went to the land of the Persians.

(1 Maccabees 4:32) 
And he gathered an army, and fought against the Persians: and he was conquered.

(1 Maccabees 4:33) 
And entering Persia, he heard that there was great commotion in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:34) 
And departing from Persia, he came.

(1 Maccabees 4:35) 
And he sent Philip, his friend, over the Jews: and he killed in Jerusalem: and took away the reward from them.

(1 Maccabees 4:36) 
And in this matter, he approached with haste, and passed through Samaria, in order to destroy the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:37) 
And when he had done this, he heard that Judas and his brothers were near, and had gathered an army, and were fighting bravely.

(1 Maccabees 4:38) 
And he said: "Now I will divide my army, and I will fight against them, and I will kill them."

(1 Maccabees 4:39) 
And he gathered his army, and rushed, and began on the road, on the ascent to Bethoron.

(1 Maccabees 4:40) 
And Judas sent, and went out with a few, to meet the army.

(1 Maccabees 4:41) 
And seeing the army coming, he said: "Because they are many, and we are few:

(1 Maccabees 4:42) 
Let us not fear them: let us fight for our souls."

(1 Maccabees 4:43) 
And when they began to fight, he approached from the place, and the army was routed.

(1 Maccabees 4:44) 
And those who were in his sight, fled on the road from Bethoron: and the Jews pursued them to the plains, and killed about eight thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:45) 
And from there, Judas and his brothers set out, and came to the plains, and came to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:46) 
And Antiochus heard, he went out with great power, to fight against the Jews: and he commanded that preparations be made.

(1 Maccabees 4:47) 
And when his army was prepared and complete, he ordered them to go into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:48) 
And coming, he pitched camp against Bethsura: and fought for many days: and made machines and works.

(1 Maccabees 4:49) 
And those who were from Bethsura went out and burned: and struck the machines.

(1 Maccabees 4:50) 
And they fought great battles.

(1 Maccabees 4:51) 
And Judas knew that they had come, and that they were fighting, and their hearts began to be troubled.

(1 Maccabees 4:52) 
And those with him appeared, to be a help to him.

(1 Maccabees 4:53) 
And he went out as though to the camps against Antiochus, and they fought battles: and about five thousand men fell from his army.

(1 Maccabees 4:54) 
And Antiochus and his army, seeing that they had fallen, returned to Judea with great sorrow.

(1 Maccabees 4:55) 
And Judas and his brothers took their dead: and they buried them in the sepulchers of their fathers.

(1 Maccabees 4:56) 
And they put their bones in the sepulchers of their fathers: and they celebrated the twenty-fifth day of the month of September, with joy and gladness.

(1 Maccabees 4:57) 
And they established these days, every year, with joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:58) 
And they built camps on Mount Zion, around the temple: and they lived with the people, with joy and gladness, and fearing God.

(1 Maccabees 5:1) 
In those days, Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers rose up, and fought against the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 5:2) 
He went into their territory and defeated a large population and gained strength.

Many were wounded and killed.

(1 Maccabees 5:19)

(1 Maccabees 5:20) 
Judas and his brothers approached and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:21) 
They killed three thousand men among the Philistine people.

(1 Maccabees 5:22) 
Judas and his companions looked at those who had fallen and took their weapons.

(1 Maccabees 5:23) 
They pursued them as far as Gaza and the borders of Judah, and defeated them as far as Gaza and the borders of Azotus.

(1 Maccabees 5:24) 
They came to Askelon and into their land, for they had their idols, and they burned them with fire.

(1 Maccabees 5:25) 
On that day, those who were in the camp and those in the borders of Judea rose up unexpectedly to attack them.

(1 Maccabees 5:26) 
Judas went out and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:27) 
He defeated them, and killed about two thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:28) 
He returned to the camp with a great multitude of spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:29) 
In those days, those in the borders of Judea gathered and said to Simon, the brother of Judas,

(1 Maccabees 5:30) 
“Judas and his brothers have done great things, and war against the enemies and us.

(1 Maccabees 5:31) 
Send us, and we will fight for our brothers.

(1 Maccabees 5:32) 
Simon sent them to fight and they were chosen, and they went with him.

(1 Maccabees 5:33) 
They fought against them on that day and defeated them, and they fled before them.

(1 Maccabees 5:34) 
They pursued them in the field and killed about three thousand men and seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:35) 
They brought from Galilee and Arbatta, their wives and children, and all that they had, and came to the land of Judah with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 5:36) 
Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers went out and came to the borders of Idumea and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:37) 
They defeated the strong among them and seized the camps and attacked those who were in the tower.

(1 Maccabees 5:38) 
They besieged them, and set up machines against them, and they stormed and burned the tower with fire, and all who were in it.

(1 Maccabees 5:39) 
They went against them in another place and killed about twenty thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:40) 
When they came to a tower, which was very fortified, they besieged it and fought against it bravely.

(1 Maccabees 5:41) 
Two thousand men fell from those who were in it, and they burned the rest with fire, and they seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:42) 
From there, they set out to fight against the Ammonites, and they found a strong people and a large population.

(1 Maccabees 5:43) 
They fought against them greatly, and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 5:44) 
They fled and Judas and those who were with him defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:45) 
They gave up their towns and returned to Judah.

(1 Maccabees 5:46) 
The Gentiles who were in Gilead gathered against Israel, who were in their borders.

(1 Maccabees 5:47) 
They fought against them and fled to their borders and came to the camps.

(1 Maccabees 5:48) 
Then the sons of foreigners came together to destroy them, and they took the road to attack Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:49) 
They went out from the camps and met them in battle and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:50) 
Many of them were wounded and killed, and the rest fled to Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:51)

(1 Maccabees 5:54)

(1 Maccabees 5:55) 
They went to Bethsura, which was a fortified city, and was a place where the people dwelt.

(1 Maccabees 5:56) 
Hearing that they were attacking the city and fighting against it, they gathered together as one.

(1 Maccabees 5:57) 
They went out from Bethsura, and many were wounded and killed among them.

(1 Maccabees 5:58) 
Judas and his brothers went into the field, and behold, a great multitude of those who were with John and who were with him in the borders of Judea, had perished.

(1 Maccabees 5:59) 
Judas and his brothers grieved and said to their relatives:

(1 Maccabees 5:60) 
“Their people have perished, and here we are. Let us fight.”

(1 Maccabees 5:61) 
He gathered the entire army and put them in prayer, to ask for peace from God.

(1 Maccabees 5:62) 
They went out with them and fought and defeated them, and many were wounded.

(1 Maccabees 5:63) 
They buried their dead.

(1 Maccabees 5:64) 
They returned to the camp, and there was a great victory.

(1 Maccabees 5:65) 
They remained in Bethsura, praising the Most High.

(1 Maccabees 5:66) 
In those days, the land of Judea had peace.

(1 Maccabees 6:1) 
In the year 150, in the eighth month, at Antioch, the other armies surrounded him.

(1 Maccabees 6:2) 
They loved Philip before he returned, and it was agreed that he would be the prince of the kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 6:3) 
Therefore, he hurried, so that he would have a task and would be ready for war. And suddenly he appeared from the ships, and entered the city, and seized it.

(1 Maccabees 6:4) 
But when Demetrius heard this, he gathered his army and set out against him.

(1 Maccabees 6:5) 
And they fought together, and Philip was driven from the city and became stronger.

(1 Maccabees 6:6) 
And Demetrius greatly lamented, and then he knew that his ruin was near.

(1 Maccabees 6:7) 
And he went to a place and commanded his friends: “Kill the boy Antiochus.”

(1 Maccabees 6:8) 
And he gave the command, and he died that day.

(1 Maccabees 6:9) 
And Demetrius sent Nicanor, the leader of the cavalry, with a great army, and he fought against Judas.

(1 Maccabees 6:10) 
And they announced to the people of Judah: “Behold, Nicanor is coming.”

(1 Maccabees 6:11) 
Having heard this, they trembled and were afraid; and the army prayed with the people, and cried out, and said:

(1 Maccabees 6:12) 
“Holy One, who has chosen this house, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, have mercy upon it; and let the filthy deeds and blasphemies of Nicanor not prevail against you.”

(1 Maccabees 6:13) 
And they fought; and about five thousand five hundred fell from Nicanor's army, and the rest fled into the city of David.

(1 Maccabees 6:14) 
After this, however, Nicanor went up to Mount Zion: and the priests and the elders of the people came out, greeting him peacefully.

(1 Maccabees 6:15) 
And they said: “There is no need to speak of this matter with the king.”

(1 Maccabees 6:16) 
And Nicanor did not accept their words, and in anger he swore to them, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:17) 
“Unless you hand over to me Judas and his army immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn down this house.”

(1 Maccabees 6:18) 
And Nicanor went away furiously. And the priests entered, standing before the altar and the temple, and saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:19) 
“You chose this house for your sanctification, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, that it may be for You a house of prayer and supplication for Your people.

(1 Maccabees 6:20) 
Avenge their iniquities, and take vengeance on them.”

(1 Maccabees 6:21) 
Now Nicanor departed from Jerusalem and placed his camp in Beth-Horon: and armies came out to meet him from Syria.

(1 Maccabees 6:22) 
And Judas sent against him. And they fought in the army of Nicanor; and about nine thousand of his army fell, and were wounded and weakened, and wounded in battle.

(1 Maccabees 6:23) 
And with this, they returned to their places. But Nicanor remained in the city of Jerusalem. And he was in the temple; and he killed everyone very unjustly.

(1 Maccabees 6:24) 
And Nicanor was angry, and said: “Unless they hand over to me Judas and his army, immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn the temple.”

(1 Maccabees 6:25) 
And Judas said: “If you hand him over to us, we will depart in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 6:26) 
And Nicanor departed, and the word was not fulfilled. And about this, Judas sent messengers to prepare for war.

(1 Maccabees 6:27) 
And they fought in Azotus; and about thirty-five thousand men fell from Nicanor's army: and Nicanor was defeated by the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 6:28) 
And the Jews fled from Azotus and pursued Nicanor as far as Gaza. And shouting after him, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:29) 
“For there will not be for us those who are to be seized by us”. And they took the head of Nicanor and his hand, which he had stretched out, and they hung it near the tower, and made it known to all.

(1 Maccabees 6:30) 
And they established one day, so that they would celebrate this day, that is, the day of victory. And they prayed and entreated the Lord.

(1 Maccabees 6:31) 
Then, calling Judas, and gathering together in the city of Jerusalem: and they decided that this should be celebrated annually on the thirteenth day of the month Adar.

(1 Maccabees 6:32) 
And the land of Judah rested for a little while.

(1 Maccabees 7:1) 
In the year 151, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, departed from Rome, and came with his men of war, and began to reign in the land of his kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 7:2) 
And when he had come into his kingdom and was seated on the throne of his reign, all the unrighteous and wicked men of Israel gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:3) 
They chose Alcimus, who had been High Priest, and decided to make him High Priest, and brought him to the king.

(1 Maccabees 7:4) 
And they accused the people, saying, "John and those who were with him have stirred up a rebellion and incited the people to revolt."

(1 Maccabees 7:5) 
Moved by these words, the king, together with some of his wicked friends, summoned them to kill John.

(1 Maccabees 7:6) 
Those who came killed John and his two sons, and then they killed the sons of those who had opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:7) 
And Alcimus did this, and all the wicked men with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:8) 
Then the entire people gathered, and they were angry; and they killed them, and they appointed righteous men to avenge them.

(1 Maccabees 7:9) 
Then Judea said, "Wickedness has been removed from Israel."

(1 Maccabees 7:10) 
Then all of his brothers and those who were with him settled in the area, and they fought Israel during those days.

(1 Maccabees 7:11) 
Then the wicked men of Israel went out and sought all the wicked, and they went away, and took the evil from among them.

(1 Maccabees 7:12) 
And on that day, there was war, and Judas struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 7:13) 
When Jason saw the wickedness in Israel, and his friends who came to mock them, he fled to the region of the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 7:14) 
He placed leaders against the borders of the people, and gathered them against them, and struck them down, and in the place of their evils, and they struck down the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 7:15) 
Then the sons of the strangers gathered together, and they came to attack Judea, and they went away from their own land.

(1 Maccabees 7:16) 
Then Simon and his brothers said, "In our days, in the days of our adversaries, we have gone forth from our land."

(1 Maccabees 7:17) 
And Judas gathered everyone together, and said, "Behold, I and my brothers, and the house of my father, we fight for the laws and the holy places."

(1 Maccabees 7:18) 
And all, because of this, rushed into battle.

(1 Maccabees 7:19) 
And he spoke, and all the nations feared him.

(1 Maccabees 7:20) 
Then Demetrius heard, and gathered his forces, and went to war in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:21) 
And he sent Nicanor, the commander of his army, to strike down the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 7:22) 
And when he approached Jerusalem, and saw the army of the Jews, he was afraid.

(1 Maccabees 7:23) 
And he feared the battle, and the fighting with the sons of Israel, and he wanted to return.

(1 Maccabees 7:24) 
And Nicanor blasphemed and swore, saying, "Unless the Jews are handed over into my hands, I will destroy the temple, and I will come and dwell there."

(1 Maccabees 7:25) 
And Judas heard the words of Nicanor, and he entered battle; and he was not afraid. And he fought against the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:26) 
And about five thousand men fell from the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:27) 
And Nicanor fled before the face of the army of the Jews, and he was struck down.

(1 Maccabees 7:28) 
And those who were in Judea, hearing that Nicanor had fallen, threw stones at them, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:29) 
And they released them, and attacked their nearest camps.

(1 Maccabees 7:30) 
And after doing this, they gathered and struck down Nicanor on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 7:31) 
And they placed their weapons, and their remains, and their heads, on a tree, and showed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:32) 
And all agreed, and swore, saying, "Blessed be the Lord, who has saved his people, and struck down the impious Nicanor, on that day."

(1 Maccabees 7:33) 
And they celebrated the fifteenth day of the month Adar, and on the same day, the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day.

(1 Maccabees 7:34) 
And thus it was said about the city of Jerusalem: "From the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day."

(1 Maccabees 7:35) 
And this is the end of Nicanor. And after Demetrius heard, he again sent Bacchides and Alcimus into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:36) 
He gave him a very strong army and went into the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:37) 
And Bacchides hurried and came, and struck them on the Sabbath, and spoke and killed many.

(1 Maccabees 7:38) 
And Judas said: "Why, why have we come forth?" And they gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:39) 
And Bacchides said: "Now, behold me and my people, I will strike and kill them."

(1 Maccabees 7:40) 
And they went out from Jerusalem, and came to Casalem, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:41) 
And from that day they struck them, and about fifteen men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 7:42) 
And Judas withdrew, and all those with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:43) 
And Bacchides gathered together and brought his men.

(1 Maccabees 7:44) 
And he came into the land of Judea, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:45) 
And all went out from Jerusalem, and they did the same with them, and they killed many of the people.

(1 Maccabees 7:46) 
And Bacchides returned, and set up camp in Azed, and built fortified cities in Judea: a fortress in Jericho, and in Emmaus, and in Bethoron, and in Bethel, and Thamnas, and Phara, and Thephon, and in the cities that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:47) 
And he placed guards in them, and fortified them, and stored provisions, and gathered soldiers in them.

(1 Maccabees 7:48) 
And with the sons of Israel, and those who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 7:49) 
And they gathered, and came to Jerusalem, and guarded the city until death.

(1 Maccabees 7:50) 
And they cried out in the city of Jerusalem, and their voice cried out to heaven.

(1 Maccabees 8:1) 
The news about the Romans was heard, that they were very strong, and were better than all the other nations, even those they fought with.

(1 Maccabees 8:2) 
And because they had brought all the peoples to themselves, they received them into friendship, and made peace with them, and because they were powerful.

(1 Maccabees 8:3) 
They heard about their wars, and the acts of valor they did in Galatia, how they had conquered them, and subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:4) 
And how much they had conquered in the provinces, and in other nations, and that they had received all of them into friendship.

(1 Maccabees 8:5) 
And about the wars, which they had waged with King Philip, and with Perseus, King of the Macedonians, and with the remaining nations that had fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 8:6) 
And because those whom they had conquered had come with them into battle, and had offered peace themselves.

(1 Maccabees 8:7) 
And the war, which they waged in Galatia, and how they subdued them, and brought them under tribute.

(1 Maccabees 8:8) 
And how much they had done in their land, and how they had subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:9) 
And about the things that were heard about them, that they were very strong men, and were kindly disposed towards their friends, and made an alliance with those who cultivated them.

(1 Maccabees 8:10) 
Therefore, Judas and his brothers pleased the Romans, and sent to them, to make friendship, and an alliance, and to be a help to them.

(1 Maccabees 8:11) 
And the matter was accepted by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:12) 
Therefore, the Roman senators sent letters of this kind to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:13) 
To the Romans and to the people of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:14) 
If we are engaged in war against you, we will first take you as an aid.

(1 Maccabees 8:15) 
But if you undertake a war against us, we will assist you in the war.

(1 Maccabees 8:16) 
The Romans are witnesses to these letters, first of all.

(1 Maccabees 8:17) 
And they sent letters of this kind to Jerusalem, to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:18) 
To Judas and his brothers, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:19) 
They sent us ambassadors to make friendship, and an alliance: so we received them.

(1 Maccabees 8:20) 
Therefore, we decided to write to you.

(1 Maccabees 8:21) 
Therefore, if anyone intends war against you in our land, we will fight for you, for as long as is necessary.

(1 Maccabees 8:22) 
And if they intend war against you, we will similarly fight for you.

(1 Maccabees 8:23) 
Therefore, they sent the letters to this effect, to the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:24) 
In the one hundred and forty-sixth year, and the beginning was in these matters, which the Jews, and those who were in Jerusalem, sent to the Romans, so that there might be friendship and alliance for them.

(1 Maccabees 9:1) 
During this time, Antiochus returned with his army from Persia and came into the city of Antioch.

(1 Maccabees 9:2) 
After entering, he took Lysias, the first of his ministers, and commanded him to lead an army, go to Judea, and destroy it.

(1 Maccabees 9:3) 
He sent him with troops, chosen men, and the king's officials. Lysias went with the army and came near Judea, near Emmaus.

(1 Maccabees 9:4) 
The Jews heard about their gathering. They gathered and placed with them Agathon and Judeus, brave men chosen for the fight.

(1 Maccabees 9:5) 
When they saw the army, they were afraid and went out of the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:6) 
The men with Lysias went to battle, and about five hundred men fell from their army.

(1 Maccabees 9:7) 
They saw that their forces had fallen and retreated to their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:8) 
Judas and his brothers saw that the wicked had diminished in strength, so they went against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:9) 
They fought and killed about eight thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 9:10) 
They scattered the rest in the camp, and all fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:11) 
Judas, hearing this, began to act bravely and, with a fortified spirit, sent chosen men to war.

(1 Maccabees 9:12) 
Simon also came with an army against Bethsura, and he fought and besieged it for a long time.

(1 Maccabees 9:13) 
But he was not able to capture it.

(1 Maccabees 9:14) 
Lysias heard that Judas and his brothers, very strong men, had done this, and that the entire multitude of the people and all their forces were gathering around them.

(1 Maccabees 9:15) 
He was very afraid and considered going to Galilee before fighting against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:16) 
He prepared and came into the region of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:17) 
Judas was with him, as was all the people, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 9:18) 
When they rushed upon them and engaged, they fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:19) 
All those in the camp fled to the borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:20) 
About three thousand men fell by the sword from their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:21) 
Judas pursued them.

(1 Maccabees 9:22) 
And he returned to the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:23) 
Then Judas gathered them in Galilee and fought against them until he conquered all of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:24) 
And John, who was called Esceneus, coming from the camp,

(1 Maccabees 9:25) 
Judas and his brothers went up to the mountain and fought.

(1 Maccabees 9:26) 
They killed Simon and his brothers, and John.

(1 Maccabees 9:27) 
And they gathered in the camp, and when they heard, they came with many men. They stayed there through the night and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:28) 
When Jonathan and Simon heard this, they retreated with those who were with them to the desert of Thecoe and camped near the water of the camp. They sent men to them from the camp in Thecoe.

(1 Maccabees 9:29) 
And when Jonathan heard, they turned back and struck in the camp; and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 9:30) 
Simon and those with him went out, joined the battle, and scattered and struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 9:31) 
And Jonathan, with his brothers and his own men, went into the camp to battle and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:32) 
And Jonathan and those with him, in the city, and in the city, and those who were there died.

(1 Maccabees 9:33) 
And they went out, struck, and captured everything in it.

(1 Maccabees 9:34) 
And it came to pass on the first day, there were about two thousand men; and on the second day, there were about four thousand.

(1 Maccabees 9:35) 
And seeing Jonathan and those who were with him, they fought against them, and they went out with their own, and with many men, and extended their hands and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:36) 
And about eight thousand men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 9:37) 
And Jonathan and those with him returned and took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 9:38) 
When he returned and came to Antioch, Lysias gathered and gave the opinion in council to the wise men.

(1 Maccabees 9:39) 
And they said that it should not happen anymore and that he should release them. They decreed that they should release them and depart from their borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:40) 
And it came to pass that in that year, Judas and his brothers went out, chose men, and sent them to Rome to make friendship and alliance with them, and to remove the yoke from themselves and the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:41) 
And the word pleased them, and they commanded the men who were sent to make friendship with them.

(1 Maccabees 9:42) 
And they sent letters to Judas and his brothers, saying: "To the people of the Jews and their brothers, greetings, friendship, and help.

(1 Maccabees 9:43) 
And it came to pass, and they decreed that they would give them help and depart from the kingdom of the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:44) 
And they wrote on bronze tablets and sent them to Rome, so that there would be a memorial of the friendship with them and with the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 9:45) 
And it came to pass, after these things, that Antiochus sent to the region of Persia and gathered a large army.

(1 Maccabees 9:46) 
And he went into Persia, and those who believed in his power were with him.

(1 Maccabees 9:47) 
They came to the city called Elymais and wanted to take the temple and guard the city.

(1 Maccabees 9:48) 
But they could not, because the plan of the city was revealed to them.

(1 Maccabees 9:49) 
And those in the city drove them out.

(1 Maccabees 9:50) 
And it came to pass that they returned to Babylonia again.

(1 Maccabees 9:51) 
And a messenger came to him in Persia, saying that the armies that were in Judea had fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:52) 
And those who had been sent to battle by the Jews had gone out and were scattered in the camps.

(1 Maccabees 9:53) 
And Antiochus considered that he would come immediately into Judea and decided to set out and prepare everything with anger.

(1 Maccabees 9:54) 
And while he was saying this, it happened that he was struck immediately and released. He fell on the mountains.

(1 Maccabees 9:55) 
And they received him, and he was on a bed, paralyzed.

(1 Maccabees 9:56) 
And he was dying, and he cried out, recognizing, and said: "I am dying in great misery.

(1 Maccabees 9:57) 
And as he was dying, he heard that the soldiers in Persia had been scattered, and that they were being pursued and killed.

(1 Maccabees 9:58) 
And when he heard the word, he cried out: "I go, and I depart, all of mine." And he went into Persia and died.

(1 Maccabees 9:59) 
And they buried him, and his son Antiochus reigned in his place.

(1 Maccabees 10:1) 
In the one hundred and sixtieth year, Simon, the brother of Jonathan, declared himself to be High Priest, succeeding his brother Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 10:2) 
In those days, Judas was fighting against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 10:3) 
And the people of Israel gathered together.

(1 Maccabees 10:4) 
Seeing that the people were seeking and in fear, Simon took action.

(1 Maccabees 10:5) 
And he chose men and sent them to King Demetrius, to ask him to withdraw the decrees he had issued against the Jews, and against the land of Judea, and to release those who were held captive in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:6) 
And King Demetrius sent them, according to the words he had spoken to them, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 10:7) 
And he wrote letters to the Jews, saying: “King Demetrius to the people of the Jews, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 10:8) 
“Because we remember you, the Jews, and your friends, and have made arrangements in accordance with them, and have received what you have done for us.”

(1 Maccabees 10:9) 
“Therefore, we have judged it right to write to you and the other Jews, saying: 'All those from Judea who come to us up to this day, let them have peace, and be without any trouble.'

(1 Maccabees 10:10) 
“And we declare all the Jews who have departed from your land up to this day, to be free from taxation and from all the tributes of the land.

(1 Maccabees 10:11) 
“Concerning all the tributes, and the salt tax, and the crown taxes which belonged to us, we release all of them and give them to you and the other Jews.

(1 Maccabees 10:12) 
“And anyone of you who is inscribed in our books, let them be your people, and those of you who have come to this day, let them be with you.

(1 Maccabees 10:13) 
“And I command the Alexandrians and all my officials: To assist you in these matters, and to establish your peace.

(1 Maccabees 10:14) 
“And what the Jews have determined for you up to this day, I also establish. And I have removed the taxes which they paid in the earlier days.”

(1 Maccabees 10:15) 
“And these things I write to you, I do for you and the other Jews, and I establish all peace in your land.”

(1 Maccabees 10:16) 
In the one hundred and fifty-fourth year, the Jews in Judea, the sons of Israel who were in captivity, departed and returned and rebuilt.

(1 Maccabees 10:17) 
And they crowned Mount Zion, and those who were with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:18) 
And the sons of Alexander, who were in Macedonia, came and established Ptolemy as king.

(1 Maccabees 10:19) 
And King Ptolemy sent to Simon the High Priest, to give him honor.

(1 Maccabees 10:20) 
And he did this. And he appointed him and his friends, and gave him many gifts, and confirmed his friendship with them, and appointed him as High Priest, and for all things that pertained to him.

(1 Maccabees 10:21) 
And they captured the city called Gazara, Ptolemy and Simon.

(1 Maccabees 10:22) 
And they fought against it a great deal, and they set it on fire, and plundered all its spoils.

(1 Maccabees 10:23) 
And they put to death the inhabitants of Gazara, and exterminated all the wickedness there.

(1 Maccabees 10:24) 
And the Jews came with Simon to Jerusalem, and they purified it, and cast out all that was unclean, and they made good inhabitants there.

(1 Maccabees 10:25) 
And on the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, they entered it with praise and palms, and with lyres, cymbals, psalteries, hymns and canticles.

(1 Maccabees 10:26) 
And they established a day each year, so that they would celebrate this day as a day of joy.

(1 Maccabees 10:27) 
And they established the land of Judea, and the priesthood, and the people, and the garrisons, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:28) 
And Simon said to himself and to his friends: “Because if those on our side fight, and if enemies come, we will not be able to resist, because of the war.”

(1 Maccabees 10:29) 
And he established Judea, and built in Jericho, and in Galilee, and in Hazor, and in Emmanuel, and in Bethsura, and in Bethlehem, and in all the places which he fortified.

(1 Maccabees 10:30) 
And he fortified them, and placed garrisons in them, and stored provisions in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:31) 
And Simon gathered all the men of war, and placed garrisons, and stored weapons in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:32) 
And John and all those who were in Judea made peace with him.

(1 Maccabees 10:33) 
And the people saw that Simon was working for their salvation, and they gave him honor and glory.

(1 Maccabees 10:34) 
And they made him a leader and High Priest, and all the Jews made him their friend.

(1 Maccabees 10:35) 
And they declared him to be in charge of all, and of all the affairs of the land, and of the weapons.

(1 Maccabees 10:36) 
And Simon heard that the Romans had heard from the Gentiles, that they had heard that they were more powerful, and they agreed to everything that was commanded to them.

(1 Maccabees 10:37) 
And they gave their friendship to Simon, and they accepted his alliance.

(1 Maccabees 10:38) 
And they sent to them, and established for him a golden shield, and gave him honor, so that he might be with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:39) 
And the people heard these words, and said: “How shall we give him honor?

(1 Maccabees 10:40) 
And they resolved to give him a great praise, and to honor him, and to glorify him.

(1 Maccabees 10:41) 
And all the Jews did this: And they made him a leader and High Priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 10:42) 
And he was in charge of the Jews, and all the priests, and all the people.

(1 Maccabees 10:43) 
And furthermore, all the affairs of the land, and the wars, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works.

(1 Maccabees 10:44) 
And they established in him all things, as before.

(1 Maccabees 10:45) 
And all the people rejoiced in his works.

(1 Maccabees 10:46) 
And as Simon worked with honor and glory, in the land and in Jerusalem, so he established all the peoples in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:1) 
In the one hundred and fiftieth year of the kingdom of the Greeks, the Romans went to Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, saying that he should give them help and take them out of the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:2) 
Then King Ptolemy answered, "I am the king of Egypt. I have come to my own land, and I have given them help, and I have restored the land to the city, and you shall not depart from me."

(1 Maccabees 11:3) 
And a war was fought against Alexander, because the Romans were in everything with Ptolemy, and Ptolemy prevailed and they departed from the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:4) 
And Ptolemy gathered all his forces and came into Syria and took many cities and killed them.

(1 Maccabees 11:5) 
And he sent a great letter to Simon and made an appointment with him in Ammathunte, which is near the mountain, that he should come to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:6) 
And he went to him and saw his glory, his army, and his equipment and was afraid, and he acted against him and did not want to do him harm.

(1 Maccabees 11:7) 
And they said to him that they would do whatever they wished against Simon, and make him king, and whoever was their friend or enemy.

(1 Maccabees 11:8) 
And because Simon saw that he was angry, he was afraid and laid his hands on him, and did him violence, for he was an old man.

(1 Maccabees 11:9) 
And they killed him and his sons and his brothers. And he sent and sent his army and killed them and inflicted violence on them.

(1 Maccabees 11:10) 
And war was made, and the children of Israel went out of the field and came to the place of battles, and he was angry and prevailed.

(1 Maccabees 11:11) 
And Alexander, the king of Syria, hearing of this, gathered all his forces together and came into Syria.

(1 Maccabees 11:12) 
And he gathered a very large army and prevailed against Ptolemy and drove him from his land.

(1 Maccabees 11:13) 
And Alexander fought a war in the land, and those from the strongest cities came to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:14) 
And he gave him a very strong city, and he made him the leader of all who were around him.

(1 Maccabees 11:15) 
And Jonathan, hearing of this, sent ambassadors to him, asking him to make friendship with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:16) 
And he was accepted by him and sent letters to him saying:

(1 Maccabees 11:17) 
King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 11:18) 
We have heard of you that you are a man powerful in virtue and that you deserve to be our friend.

(1 Maccabees 11:19) 
Therefore, we have appointed you today to be a high priest and one of the king's friends.

(1 Maccabees 11:20) 
And he sent him a purple cloak and a golden crown, and he gave them to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:21) 
And Jonathan put them on, and was in the day of the feast of the seventh month, and began to go out to the people and sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 11:22) 
And King Alexander, hearing this, made him a friend, even before he was with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:23) 
And he wrote to him, saying: "Why have you given your people the law, and made a covenant with the Romans?"

(1 Maccabees 11:24) 
And he was very angry and acted against him, and Alexander, hearing this, gathered great forces.

(1 Maccabees 11:25) 
And he commanded Jonathan and brought him before the king in Ptolemais. And the king came and met him and fought.

(1 Maccabees 11:26) 
And they fled from Ptolemais and pursued them to the gates, and about three thousand men fell from Ptolemais.

(1 Maccabees 11:27) 
And Jonathan took Alexander's sword, and they went out of the city and fled.

(1 Maccabees 11:28) 
And Jonathan fought in Bethsura, and they came together in battle.

(1 Maccabees 11:29) 
And Alexander sent letters to Jonathan in peace. And Jonathan sent to him, for he was acting in peace and to him, in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:30) 
And King Alexander put Jonathan in honor and gave him possessions and divisions.

(1 Maccabees 11:31) 
And Jonathan went out to Ptolemais, and King Alexander met him, and he honored him greatly.

(1 Maccabees 11:32) 
And he took him and they met and slept together.

(1 Maccabees 11:33) 
And Alexander went out and went into Egypt and reigned.

(1 Maccabees 11:34) 
And Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, died, and he made his son Philip reign, who was in Egypt for eighteen years.

(1 Maccabees 11:35) 
And Philip died, and Demetrius reigned.

(1 Maccabees 12:1) 
In the year one hundred and forty-four, those who were in Rome sent greetings to the people of Macedonia and to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:2) 
The Jews in Judea received this message.

(1 Maccabees 12:3) 
They also sent to the Romans, Athenians, Chaldeans, and all the nations gathered in the same place in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:4) 
This is a copy of the letter: "The Jewish brothers send greetings and prosperity to the people of Rome.

(1 Maccabees 12:5) 
If you are well, we are well.

(1 Maccabees 12:6) 
Because of the war we had with Philip and those who were with him, we have had to deal with various events, which concerned both you and us.

(1 Maccabees 12:7) 
You sent us a letter and we sent you one also, asking that we might confirm our treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:8) 
So, at the time we wrote to you, we wrote to our Jewish brothers and your priests. We asked them not to ignore but to observe these things.

(1 Maccabees 12:9) 
We are hoping what we have agreed upon is what you agree upon also.

(1 Maccabees 12:10) 
Therefore, we are sending you Antiochus and Jason, the sons of Jason, and the Romans sent them to you to confirm what we have written, and for you to confirm what we have written.

(1 Maccabees 12:11) 
And now, farewell.""

(1 Maccabees 12:12) 
This letter was written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:13) 
They wrote to those who were in Judea, and to the Jews who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 12:14) 
"Jewish brothers, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 12:15) 
The people of Rome and the Jews wish you peace and prosperity forever. May God grant you grace, both now and in the future.

(1 Maccabees 12:16) 
The Romans sent envoys to us to confirm friendship and a treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:17) 
They established decrees so that we, our people, you, and your land would not wage war.

(1 Maccabees 12:18) 
Therefore, if war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:19) 
Likewise, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:20) 
We have confirmed these things just as they decreed.

(1 Maccabees 12:21) 
These words were written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:22) 
Then they sent letters to King Demetrius and to every nation in Asia, and to those in Judea, and to those at peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:23) 
Jewish brothers, greetings, prosperity, and health.

(1 Maccabees 12:24) 
Demetrius and his ancestors have made peace with you and the Jewish people.

(1 Maccabees 12:25) 
We have confirmed these words we wrote to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:26) 
So, if you want to make a treaty with us, write to us, and we will write to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:27) 
The people confirmed that Demetrius had granted us peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:28) 
For King Demetrius saw that the Jewish people belonged to God, and that they fought against those who opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 12:29) 
He included them among his friends and sent them honors.

(1 Maccabees 12:30) 
This was during the days when they wrote to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:31) 
At the command of the Romans, letters were sent to the Jews, saying, "Greetings and prosperity to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:32) 
The people of Rome and their allies send peace, strength, and prosperity to the Jewish nation forever.

(1 Maccabees 12:33) 
If war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:34) 
Again, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:35) 
These words, written, we sent them to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 13:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-ninth year, King Demetrius wrote letters to Simon the high priest and leader of the people, and to his friends, and to the Jewish people, both those in Judea and those in other lands, offering greetings of peace.

(1 Maccabees 13:2) 
The letters read: “King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:3) 
“Because of the troubles the Jews had caused, we have decided, though with much pain, to acknowledge their strength, courage, and honor. So we will do as the Jews wish.”

(1 Maccabees 13:4) 
“Therefore, we decree to them and their friends, and to the land of Judea, freedom and release: and we let go and forgive them all things which the Jews have taken until this day, and all the crimes they committed.”

(1 Maccabees 13:5) 
“Let all that they did through ignorance or in secret be forgiven.”

(1 Maccabees 13:6) 
“We will provide for the construction of the Temple and the repair of its walls, as well as the other expenses that were required.”

(1 Maccabees 13:7) 
“Furthermore, the Jews will be free to do whatever they want.”

(1 Maccabees 13:8) 
“We grant them permission to use grain, weapons, and the other supplies and tributes given to them, for the building of Jerusalem.”

(1 Maccabees 13:9) 
All of these decrees were written in public records, and they made Simon the leader, to be the high priest, with the care of the Temple, and to give him great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:10) 
The people heard these words and said, “Great is the faithfulness of Simon and his sons.”

(1 Maccabees 13:11) 
And because all the people and the priests agreed, they chose Simon to be their leader and priest.

(1 Maccabees 13:12) 
He was to have care of the Temple and its ministers and be in charge of everything.

(1 Maccabees 13:13) 
They also decided to write in the public records and place in a holy place that Simon was their leader, and this was to last forever. And everyone did him homage.

(1 Maccabees 13:14) 
The Jews made a covenant with Simon that, as long as he lived, he would be their leader and high priest, and his sons as long as they lived.

(1 Maccabees 13:15) 
They refused to deal with the other nations and their wicked ways.

(1 Maccabees 13:16) 
Simon built fortresses in Judea and fortified them with defenses and weapons and gathered troops.

(1 Maccabees 13:17) 
And he sent peace to King Demetrius.

(1 Maccabees 13:18) 
In turn, King Demetrius heard him, confirmed his position, and recognized his authority.

(1 Maccabees 13:19) 
He gave him testimony, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 13:20) 
He also learned that the Romans and Spartans sent envoys to him to make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:21) 
They met, made an alliance, and established a treaty with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:22) 
He also heard that the Romans sent to him envoys, excellent and most beloved men, with great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:23) 
And they sent them to him to confirm the alliance and the treaty they had made with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:24) 
They sent him letters on bronze tablets, in which was written: “The people of Rome and the Spartans to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:25) 
“We have received the letters and tablets that you sent to us.

(1 Maccabees 13:26) 
“And we have established a treaty and alliance with you, and we write saying: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:27) 
“If we wage war against you, your people, and your land, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 13:28) 
“This is the testimony of these words which we send to you. And we have written them on bronze tablets and placed them in a holy place so that we may keep them with you there.”

(1 Maccabees 13:29) 
And this is the example of the writing that was sent by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 13:30) 
The Romans and Spartans, to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:31) 
We have sent our envoys to you to make an alliance and treaty with you, and it has pleased us to do so.

(1 Maccabees 13:32) 
And this is what is written on the bronze tablets that we have written: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:33) 
“And if they first wage war against us, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 14:1) 
In the one hundred and sixty-ninth year of the world, the Romans, at the right moment, sent to Simon the high priest, the leaders of the Jewish people, and the senate of the Jews to treat of peace and establish alliances.

(1 Maccabees 14:2) 
They sent this message: "We have come to you and to your people because of your honor and glory. We seek a partnership and friendship with you.

(1 Maccabees 14:3) 
We now wish to take up arms and offer help to you against all your enemies."

(1 Maccabees 14:4) 
Their words were well received by the people and the priests.

(1 Maccabees 14:5) 
So the people said, "Let us ask Simon to make peace with us!" And they made peace with them.

(1 Maccabees 14:6) 
Simon welcomed them and appointed them as leaders and officials. He gave them weapons and help.

(1 Maccabees 14:7) 
Simon told the people, "We and our brothers and the family of our father fought many battles and struggles. We faced many hardships for the Law and the sanctuary, and we were saved.

(1 Maccabees 14:8) 
Therefore, today we hold the power.

(1 Maccabees 14:9) 
In this same year, Demetrius was taken captive. The Jews then gathered and went to Demetrius to honor him.

(1 Maccabees 14:10) 
Demetrius sent a message to them, gathered his army, and said, "I and my brothers, and my father's family, fought for the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:11) 
When they came, we gave them help and granted them honor, Jerusalem, and all their possessions. I confirmed all of this and gave it to them.

(1 Maccabees 14:12) 
I confirmed all things that are and will be for as long as this continues."

(1 Maccabees 14:13) 
So all the men, all the leaders of the people, and the priests decided that Simon should be their friend and make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:14) 
They heard this and were pleased, and they decided to write it down on tablets and place them before their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 14:15) 
They wrote on the tablets: "In the one hundred and seventieth year, the Jews, priests, and the people have cast off the yoke of the Gentiles, along with all the abominations and great pride.

(1 Maccabees 14:16) 
They established Simon as their leader and high priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:17) 
He would be their leader and care for the sanctuary. He would be in charge of all their works.

(1 Maccabees 14:18) 
He would be in charge of the weapons, the fortifications, the vessels, and the works of the Temple.

(1 Maccabees 14:19) 
His sons would all hold positions of dignity and would succeed their father.

(1 Maccabees 14:20) 
Simon appointed his sons and gave them weapons and an army. He instructed them to conduct the war and establish armies in the land.

(1 Maccabees 14:21) 
They appointed Simon as the leader in Jerusalem so that he could build fortifications and guard them. He built high walls, great towers, a large house, and fortifications all around.

(1 Maccabees 14:22) 
Simon sent a message to Demetrius and gave him a golden crown and palm branches. He sent gifts from Jerusalem and the trees within it, and it was done.

(1 Maccabees 14:23) 
He struck the people and the people who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 14:24) 
He heard that the Romans and the people in the land of the Jews had heard that they had appointed Simon as their leader and high priest. He heard that Simon and his brothers had made an alliance with them, and that they had done it with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:25) 
They welcomed him and wrote it on bronze tablets to be placed on the Mount Zion. These are the examples:

(1 Maccabees 14:26) 
In the one hundred and seventy-second year, under Simon, the great high priest, leader, and governor of the Jews, and his brothers,

(1 Maccabees 14:27) 
the Jews had gathered after they had rebelled and fled from the land of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 14:28) 
They gathered and came to Jerusalem and ascended Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:29) 
They saw that the sanctuary had been defiled and polluted.

(1 Maccabees 14:30) 
They decided, and after they had purified themselves, they appointed Simon and gave him weapons.

(1 Maccabees 14:31) 
They established him as high priest and his sons forever, until a faithful prophet would arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:32) 
And it was throughout all the land of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:33) 
Then it happened that they rebuilt Jerusalem and the fortifications that were all around, and the house, and the walls around Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:34) 
And this is the example that was created in their days.

(1 Maccabees 15:1) 
Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, sent letters from Rome, written on tablets, to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to those in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:2) 
The words in the letter were these: “King Demetrius sends greetings to the Jewish nation, and to the Senate, and to the Jews who are in Judea, greetings and peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:3) 
“Because we remember your good spirit, and goodwill towards us, and the friendship and favor that you have shown towards us, and for this, we are glad.”

(1 Maccabees 15:4) 
“For this reason, we have decreed for you, and for your race, immunity from taxes, and we give to you whatever we give to other nations.”

(1 Maccabees 15:5) 
“And now, I release you, and the Jews, and the people of Jerusalem, and your borders, and I will rebuild the city, and I will restore the vessels, and whatever was taken from the Temple, I will return to you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:6) 
And quickly, he sent letters to Jonathan, saying thus:

(1 Maccabees 15:7) 
“King Demetrius to the brother Jonathan, and to the Jews, and to the Senate of the Jews, and to the rest who are with them, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:8) 
“Because we have heard you, and we have decreed as you have said, and we have commanded our servants who are with us, to make peace with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:9) 
“We will affirm the testimony which comes from us to you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:10) 
“That whatever you have decided with our people be ratified. But if there were any decrees made by those who didn't know, we will amend them.”

(1 Maccabees 15:11) 
“And now we have commanded our servants to speak with you in peace, and to obey you in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:12) 
And these letters were written in the one hundred and seventieth year, and in that year, the wars and battles ceased.

(1 Maccabees 15:13) 
And the king of the Romans heard that they had been sent into Judea, and said:

(1 Maccabees 15:14) 
“We also will send to those who are in Judea, and we will send to them who are in Judea, peace and friendship, so that they might be enrolled with Jonathan and with the Jews.”

(1 Maccabees 15:15) 
And he sent letters into Judea, and said: “The Senate of the Romans, to Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and happiness.”

(1 Maccabees 15:16) 
“If you have undertaken a war against us, we do not have one, because we do not fight with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:17) 
“Now, therefore, we know that you have been chosen as our friends and allies:”

(1 Maccabees 15:18) 
“And we have commanded that henceforth we will speak with you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:19) 
“Just as to our people, and in our kingdom, and whatever you send to us, we will do well for you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:20) 
And this which the Romans wrote to the Jews, on bronze tablets, so that they might have a reminder of peace and help, and they sent it to Rome, to have it with them.

(1 Maccabees 15:21) 
After this, indeed, Simon, also writing, sent to Jonathan his brother, and he was with him for the support of the wars, and he appointed the entire army and sent it to him.

(1 Maccabees 15:22) 
And Numenius, the son of Antioch, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, the envoys from Judea, heard that the Jewish people had been mistreated.

(1 Maccabees 15:23) 
And they began to search, and they wanted to kill those who were with Jonathan, but they could not:

(1 Maccabees 15:24) 
because Jonathan had been informed, and he delivered them, and they could not do anything against them.

(1 Maccabees 15:25) 
And they came to Gaza, and those who were in Gaza expelled them, and Jonathan and those with him shut them in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:26) 
And the Lord knew, and gave them into his hand.

(1 Maccabees 15:27) 
And he fought against them and those who had come, and all those who were with them on the land, and he set fire to the gates, which were around Gaza, and plundered them, and burned them.

(1 Maccabees 15:28) 
And they fought against them, and all who were with him, and killed them; and they took great spoils from them.

(1 Maccabees 15:29) 
And it happened that, when Demetrius heard that Jonathan and those with him had come to the camp against him, and were fighting, and had become very strong, and had routed them in battle,

(1 Maccabees 15:30) 
he was very angry.

(1 Maccabees 15:31) 
And immediately he sent, and gathered the strongest men, and gave orders, and the army came.

(1 Maccabees 15:32) 
And he came to Antioch, and appointed two commanders of his army against them, and against those who were with Jonathan, and commanded them to come quickly.

(1 Maccabees 15:33) 
And he came to Jonathan, and said: “We are against you.” And Jonathan and those with him went out to battle, and they fought.

(1 Maccabees 15:34) 
And they were sent into their camp, and those with Jonathan conquered all, and they fled.

(1 Maccabees 15:35) 
And Jonathan and those who were with him took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 15:36) 
And he struck those in Ashkelon, and those who were with him, and they went out from their land.

(1 Maccabees 15:37) 
And the next day, he went to Beth-zur, a fortified city, and they met him, and greeted him, and gave him and those who were with him many things.

(1 Maccabees 15:38) 
And King Demetrius, hearing these things, sent again to Beth-zur, and wrote letters:

(1 Maccabees 15:39) 
“Peace to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to the army:”

(1 Maccabees 15:40) 
“Because I have fought for you, and for your brothers, and for your sons, and I have caused them to come, and I have sent them to you, with all their belongings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:41) 
“Therefore, if any of them who are in Judea have fled from their places, and have come to me, I will vindicate them for you and for your brothers.”

(1 Maccabees 15:42) 
“And now I will appoint you as allies and friends, and I will send you to my court, so that you may see what is necessary for me.”

(1 Maccabees 15:43) 
And he sent into the city of Jerusalem, to give them gifts, and sacrifices, and pleasant things, and they granted and gave to them.

(1 Maccabees 15:44) 
And they received, and then, and they built with Jonathan, and with all his brothers, and with him who was in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:45) 
And they all saw the works of Jonathan, and that he fought, and endured most bravely, and all the labor, and they joined with him.

(1 Maccabees 15:46) 
And they chose him, and appointed him as their leader, and waged war with the nations, and with the nations, and in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:1) 
In the one hundred and fifty-ninth year, King Demetrius sent letters and gathered the people in a great multitude, and he entered the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:2) 
Upon hearing this, Jonathan ordered an army to go out of Jerusalem to confront him, and they attacked them.

(1 Maccabees 16:3) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace and with a great promise because he was growing weak.

(1 Maccabees 16:4) 
He said, “Let us strike first before they join with Alexander, and let us do these things to him.”

(1 Maccabees 16:5) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan, saying, “We will make you and your friends and your holy city great, and if you do these things for us, you will have whatever you ask of us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:6) 
Then Jonathan, in Jerusalem, supplied the people with weapons and said to them, “We will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:7) 
And Jonathan selected the men of war and prepared, and fought against Demetrius, and the army departed from the land, and the army that was with Demetrius came.

(1 Maccabees 16:8) 
And they came into the land of Judea, and Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace, and said, “Let us not do this to you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:9) 
And he gave him glory and confirmed him and all the prisoners he released.

(1 Maccabees 16:10) 
Then he came to Jerusalem and entered the house of the temple and heard that John, the son of Absalom, was in Gadara, and he stationed himself in Gadara.

(1 Maccabees 16:11) 
And he sent men from Gadara to take him, and those sent came and struck him and killed him.

(1 Maccabees 16:12) 
And as for the rest of the words of John, and his deeds, and the virtues which he did, are these not written in the book of the days of John?

(1 Maccabees 16:13) 
And there was great pride among the people, and they knew that John was dead.

(1 Maccabees 16:14) 
And they sent and apprehended and killed the sons of Jambri and those in Gazara, and after this, a fight began again in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:15) 
And Jonathan gathered all the people and went out to war, and he came to Casali and placed the camp there.

(1 Maccabees 16:16) 
And Simon sent and placed the camp opposite Casali, and they fought for many days.

(1 Maccabees 16:17) 
And those in Casali made peace with Jonathan and gave him their right hands, and he took them and went into Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:18) 
And Jonathan chose elders and sought counsel and gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:19) 
And Tryphon, hearing that Jonathan had gathered many troops, planned to kill him.

(1 Maccabees 16:20) 
And he came to Bethsan and went out against him, and Jonathan went to Bethsan with forty chosen men.

(1 Maccabees 16:21) 
And Tryphon knew, and he set an ambush there to kill him, and they were with him.

(1 Maccabees 16:22) 
And Jonathan said to Simon his brother, “Choose men and go out, and we will fight for our brothers, and their fear will not disturb them.”

(1 Maccabees 16:23) 
And he gave them weapons and said to them, “Fight until we die.”

(1 Maccabees 16:24) 
And Jonathan and those with him fought, and Simon and those with him fell.

(1 Maccabees 16:25) 
And the people were sorrowful and knew that Jonathan was dead, and they mourned for him, and they were...

(1 Maccabees 16:26) 
But he gathered all those who were in the land and gathered all those who were in the borders of Judea, to make war against those who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:27) 
And Simon went out and placed the camp against them, and they fought for many days, and they stationed themselves.

(1 Maccabees 16:28) 
And he took them and pursued them and struck the men of war and broke their hands.

(1 Maccabees 16:29) 
And he gathered and placed the camp against the city and built towers.

(1 Maccabees 16:30) 
And Simon and those with him took and gave them weapons of war and placed the camp, and they gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:31) 
And they gave them peace, and they went out of the land, and he took the city and cleansed it from defilement and brought inhabitants into it and built in it.

(1 Maccabees 16:32) 
And those who were in the land of Judea saw the works of Simon and the glory which he did for his people, and he gathered the elders and the older men.

(1 Maccabees 16:33) 
And they said to themselves, “Let us make Simon king and his sons and his people, and he will fight for us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:34) 
And these words pleased the people, and they made Simon king for all the days of his life and his sons until he died.

(1 Maccabees 16:35) 
And he made a pact with them and took the camps with them.

(1 Maccabees 16:36) 
And there was war in the land, and he ceased, and Simon was glorified and gave peace in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:37) 
And he built in Judea a great wall around Jerusalem and built high places and great towers around Jerusalem and around them.

(1 Maccabees 16:38) 
And he sent Jonathan into the army to gather and have weapons of war and gave them weapons of war.

(2 Maccabees 1:1) 
To the Jewish people in Egypt, from the Jewish people in Judea—greetings, good health, and peace.

(2 Maccabees 1:2) 
We pray that you are well and that all your affairs are flourishing.

(2 Maccabees 1:3) 
In this past year, we have seen King Demetrius in power, wearing the crown, working through his reign, and fighting battles.

(2 Maccabees 1:4) 
We Jewish people in Jerusalem are sending this letter to you, our brothers and sisters in Egypt, with greetings of peace.

(2 Maccabees 1:5) 
The Lord saved us from great danger, and we give Him great praise.

(2 Maccabees 1:6) 
Demetrius's enemies and his allies attacked us, engaging in battles.

(2 Maccabees 1:7) 
But our God did not abandon us; rather, He freed us from these dangers.

(2 Maccabees 1:8) 
When we fought, God was with us. Our enemies were defeated.

(2 Maccabees 1:9) 
In Jerusalem, the leaders and their armies were advancing towards the city.

(2 Maccabees 1:10) 
When they came near the battle, we cried out to the Lord, and He sent a great voice of thunder and an earthquake.

(2 Maccabees 1:11) 
The earth was shaken. They were terrified and fled.

(2 Maccabees 1:12) 
God threw them into confusion, and many of them were killed by their own soldiers.

(2 Maccabees 1:13) 
We took their spoils and killed more than twenty thousand men.

(2 Maccabees 1:14) 
We know that you are always acting kindly towards us, and towards all who live according to the Law, and who fight for the Law. We are always acting kindly towards you.

(2 Maccabees 1:15) 
And we also know that the wicked priest Menelaus sent Heliodorus, who was sent by King Seleucus to plunder the Temple.

(2 Maccabees 1:16) 
We were present in the city at that time, and we know the customs of the city, and what was happening.

(2 Maccabees 1:17) 
For when he was in Jerusalem, he appeared, and was present, and came from God Himself.

(2 Maccabees 1:18) 
While he was praying with the crowd, some men appeared to him who had never been seen before; they were in gold and wearing magnificent robes.

(2 Maccabees 1:19) 
Standing and speaking to Heliodorus and his companions, they said,

(2 Maccabees 1:20) 
“Heliodorus, obey this law.”

(2 Maccabees 1:21) 
When all the men who were with him were present, they were terrified and were on the verge of death. They were hopeful and prayed to the Most High not to destroy them.

(2 Maccabees 1:22) 
When he had gone forward, they were afraid and died. Those mentioned above, along with those present, then appeared in prayer to the Most High.

(2 Maccabees 1:23) 
Then a man appeared, saying to Heliodorus and his companions, and to those who had brought him,

(2 Maccabees 1:24) 
“Those present, believing and fearing, then joined with those who were with him.”

(2 Maccabees 1:25) 
When they arrived, they were with those who were believers. Then, in this moment, He was with them.

(2 Maccabees 1:26) 
When in Jerusalem, he saw the vision. From that place, and from Jerusalem, the vision was for all time.

(2 Maccabees 1:27) 
And we preach about Him, and we preach about you—according to the time. And in the present time, we preach about you, and in you, and in you, and in you.

(2 Maccabees 1:28) 
And because it has happened, and in Jerusalem it happened. The events have been fulfilled in every way.

(2 Maccabees 1:29) 
And in all of the events, the events, and the events, and in all things. The events, the events, the events, and the events.

(2 Maccabees 1:30) 
When they saw it, and when they saw it, and that which was, and that which was, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which, and in which.

(2 Maccabees 1:31) 
For Heliodorus, and those who were with him, were there, and were there, and were there, in Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 1:32) 
And in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days, and in the days.

(2 Maccabees 1:33) 
To you, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all, and from all.

(2 Maccabees 1:34) 
Therefore, knowing and believing in the Lord always, and with God, and believing, and believing, and believing.

(2 Maccabees 1:35) 
And that with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with, and with.

(2 Maccabees 1:36) 
To you, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things, and in all things.

(2 Maccabees 2:1) 
The books of Nehemiah and the Acts of the Kings contain these same accounts, along with the writings about the kings and the prophets, and the accounts of David.

(2 Maccabees 2:2) 
The first book, that is, the book of Nehemiah, contains the history and the accounts of the kings, as well as the writings of the prophets.

(2 Maccabees 2:3) 
I collected the accounts of the kings, the writings of the prophets, and the accounts of David, and the sacred gifts of the kings.

(2 Maccabees 2:4) 
The books of those who wrote about David and the acts of Solomon are available.

(2 Maccabees 2:5) 
Thus, a history was compiled to instruct those who want to learn and those who are abroad.

(2 Maccabees 2:6) 
Both the author and those who carefully researched it, took great care.

(2 Maccabees 2:7) 
For not all writings, as in these, should be presented in this way, especially the historical accounts, because of the events described.

(2 Maccabees 2:8) 
The author then sent a short treatise, and he included those things that were relevant to the matter in order to be brief.

(2 Maccabees 2:9) 
Diligence must be given to those who read, but to those who write, the ability to speak and the diligence of investigation into the subject itself.

(2 Maccabees 2:10) 
Therefore, we will now discuss what should be done with these things, and having made this preface, we will begin the present discourse.

(2 Maccabees 2:11) 
When Judas Maccabeus waged war, he chose to honor his fallen soldiers, and he secretly sent some of his friends to retrieve the bones of those who had fallen.

(2 Maccabees 2:12) 
They were brought under their tunics, and they carried them to Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 2:13) 
And they placed them in the tombs of their fathers, in a place that was revealed to them.

(2 Maccabees 2:14) 
On the day of the feast, when the children of Israel were rejoicing, they prayed and implored that the sins which had been committed would be forgiven.

(2 Maccabees 2:15) 
Judas and the leaders, along with the people, prayed and implored that sin would be blotted out completely.

(2 Maccabees 2:16) 
For the glorious deeds and the valiant actions in war, the Jews and their brothers, did not seek honor, but faith.

(2 Maccabees 2:17) 
For they saw it as good and honorable to fight to the death and to give their lives for those things that pertain to God.

(2 Maccabees 2:18) 
Therefore, as we were writing the remaining works from Jason of Cyrene, and from those things that especially pertain to Judas, we ourselves, for the sake of brevity, have made this preface.

(2 Maccabees 2:19) 
Jason of Cyrene wrote five books about Judas Maccabeus and his brothers, about the purification of the great temple, the consecration of the altar, the wars against King Antiochus Epiphanes, and the cause for liberty.

(2 Maccabees 2:20) 
And about those things that were done against him and those who were with him, and about the things that were accomplished.

(2 Maccabees 2:21) 
And about the battles against the Greeks in Persia, and in the place called Garisa, and other such events, he includes all of these things individually.

(2 Maccabees 2:22) 
Therefore, we attempt to summarize these events in a short form, and we give our attention to those who wrote and those who read.

(2 Maccabees 2:23) 
And I say this to the reader, and to those who read, so that they may be able to understand more easily.

(2 Maccabees 2:24) 
And we will say these things at the end, as in the beginning, and in the middle, and in the end.

(2 Maccabees 3:1) 
While the holy city was living in peace, and the laws were being observed in the best way possible due to piety, there was hatred because of evil.

(2 Maccabees 3:2) 
It happened that some of the citizens, specifically Philip, a man from the region of Syria, and the same man put in charge of the city, became very angry; but also Jason with his followers, who wickedly corrupted the just law and a holy life,

(2 Maccabees 3:3) 
were commanding that the holy temple in Jerusalem be moved, and that the sacred offerings, money, and revenues, which had been given by holy men, and which were provided by good men, be taken away.

(2 Maccabees 3:4) 
The one who was in charge, Onias, who was placed in charge as the High Priest, and a good and gentle man, and who hated evil, said

(2 Maccabees 3:5) 
to King Ptolemy, who was in Alexandria, that he would rebuke these men for the illegal things they had done.

(2 Maccabees 3:6) 
But when they arrived, and remained in the same city, by the providence of God, men were sent from the people, to handle the business of money.

(2 Maccabees 3:7) 
When they came to Philip and his associates, they were asked to give money for the business, and they immediately begged them not to do anything unjust.

(2 Maccabees 3:8) 
But because they insisted on this, and spoke against all the requests, then Onias, who was in charge as the High Priest, shouted, saying, "These are the ones who were insulting the temples in Jerusalem, and stealing the money of the poor"

(2 Maccabees 3:9) 
for which reason, they and their children, who were righteous according to the holy law, and with Onias, the High Priest, and others who were of the priesthood.

(2 Maccabees 3:10) 
Then Philip and his associates, because they were not able to achieve anything concerning this matter, struck them with anger, and sent all of them, who had spoken against the evil, to Ptolemy.

(2 Maccabees 3:11) 
When the king was angry with them, and ordered the wicked to be tortured, and that they should be scourged in Jerusalem, and he gave them all those things, except for what they had wickedly done in the city,

(2 Maccabees 3:12) 
But Onias, when he heard that they were suffering unjustly, begged and pleaded for them, because they were from the people, and he pleaded for them.

(2 Maccabees 3:13) 
This is the very same thing that happened in Jerusalem, it came to pass, while Heliodorus, appointed by King Seleucus, and placed in charge of the treasury, was entering the city in order to receive the money.

(2 Maccabees 3:14) 
And when he approached, with the whole army, and with the intent of the city, Heliodorus was seen, who was appointed by the king, and with the power to do evil.

(2 Maccabees 3:15) 
However, the priests and the whole multitude were present at prayer, and they were calling upon Him, who gave the law, and for those who preserved holy things.

(2 Maccabees 3:16) 
Then the High Priest, and all the multitude, with tears, and with prayer, begged that he who was appointed, should be saved, and that he who had been sent to do the work, would be preserved.

(2 Maccabees 3:17) 
But Heliodorus was already at the entrance to the treasuries, with the guard, and the custodians, who were around him.

(2 Maccabees 3:18) 
Then a man appeared to him in a frightening way, with terrible glory, and with weapons, he commanded that he rush into battle, and they struck him very severely.

(2 Maccabees 3:19) 
And when he thought he would enter more boldly, the treasuries, they came to him with scourges, and struck him, and threw him on the ground, with great fear.

(2 Maccabees 3:20) 
Those who were around him, then, and his limbs were bound, and he was tied up, so that he should do completely what he was ordered to do by the king.

(2 Maccabees 3:21) 
However, while he was lying on the ground, and enduring the most harsh torments, it happened that he himself was being forced to do all things.

(2 Maccabees 3:22) 
Meanwhile, while those in the temple were rejoicing, the whole multitude, and they were worshipping the all-powerful God, who saved the glory, who works miracles for everything.

(2 Maccabees 3:23) 
Heliodorus, however, when he had fallen, and was not able to rise, was sent with his companions, and they carried him, as if he were already dead.

(2 Maccabees 3:24) 
When they were in the place, and Heliodorus with his companions were at the king's garrison, then, those who had done this, asked him about those who had done this, and about the things he had done, and about the things he had carried out.

(2 Maccabees 3:25) 
However, he himself answered in their sight, that he seemed to be through the force of violence, and that it was as had been spoken by God.

(2 Maccabees 3:26) 
For when he was with the soldiers, who were around him, two very excellent young men appeared to him, and of great glory, who stood over him, and struck him very severely.

(2 Maccabees 3:27) 
And they who are in sight came to him, and in his eyes, and who then struck him.

(2 Maccabees 3:28) 
Therefore, when they were in the place, and in these things, all of those who were there, glorified the Lord, because he did wonderful things.

(2 Maccabees 3:29) 
However, those who were in the place, glorified God, and gave the gifts of thanks, in the temple, and to those who had been saved, for Heliodorus, who was dead.

(2 Maccabees 3:30) 
Heliodorus, however, promised to God, who was life, and saved him, and all those things that had come, and all those things that had been done, and had now perished, gave his hand to them.

(2 Maccabees 3:31) 
Onias, however, when he was no longer in life, and congratulated him on what God had saved him, and what he had given to him.

(2 Maccabees 3:32) 
Then the king, when he arrived at him, and at the Hebrews, who were from Jerusalem, and who were with great glory, and with great glory in peace, and gave them gifts of every kind, and blessed God.

(2 Maccabees 3:33) 
But also Onias, who was in charge as High Priest, who had been saved, prayed for all the people, and gave them peace, and gave them peace.

(2 Maccabees 4:1) 
It happened that when Antiochus, also called Epiphanes, entered the city, he wanted to quickly expel Heliodorus from his position. Heliodorus had returned without fulfilling his orders.

(2 Maccabees 4:2) 
Therefore, he sent Lysias, the commander of his army and the administrator of his affairs, to remove Heliodorus from his position.

(2 Maccabees 4:3) 
Upon hearing this, Heliodorus went to Ptolemais, gathered a large crowd there, and prepared to use deceit.

(2 Maccabees 4:4) 
For he brought forth accusations before the king against those of the city who were wicked.

(2 Maccabees 4:5) 
These were Jason and those with him who practiced impiety and drove out their fellow citizens.

(2 Maccabees 4:6) 
Nor was there innocent blood which did not cry out to God for vengeance.

(2 Maccabees 4:7) 
Therefore, immediately Lysias, encouraging the people, accused Ptolemais of the evils committed against the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:8) 
And he accused the king of all these things.

(2 Maccabees 4:9) 
Then Antiochus, enraged, immediately heeded the advice of Lysias.

(2 Maccabees 4:10) 
And he appointed Jason, without delay, to punish those who had attacked and to inflict punishment on the citizens.

(2 Maccabees 4:11) 
When Jason arrived, as soon as he appeared, he struck his own brothers and drove his enemies into exile.

(2 Maccabees 4:12) 
And he did not have power in the kingdom, nor great honor.

(2 Maccabees 4:13) 
Then Menelaus, as mentioned before, the brother of Jason, sold himself to the prince, through much money, and swore to be the king's friend.

(2 Maccabees 4:14) 
He sent Jason into the city with three men from the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:15) 
When they received the king's letters, they went to the king and explained the matter to him.

(2 Maccabees 4:16) 
Then Menelaus, in the absence of Jason, promised three hundred talents of silver, and seventy talents from other gifts, from every promise that was given.

(2 Maccabees 4:17) 
And he sought to obtain the priestly office.

(2 Maccabees 4:18) 
Therefore, the king gave it to Menelaus, and he took on the priestly office, ordering that Jason be brought to trial from the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:19) 
And he sent Jason to the city, sending him letters concerning what he had done and what he had accomplished.

(2 Maccabees 4:20) 
When he arrived, he was brought in by Menelaus, and when the people heard this, they immediately became angry at Jason and killed him.

(2 Maccabees 4:21) 
And Menelaus succeeded to the priesthood, yet he did not fulfill any priestly duties, nor did he care for the laws, nor did he consider judgments, but he did everything according to the will and pleasure of the king.

(2 Maccabees 4:22) 
Then Menelaus went with those who were wicked from the city, and they sent to the king and put them to death in the city.

(2 Maccabees 4:23) 
And when they came, many from the city were delivered to punishment, and the blood of many was shed because of the anger that had come from Jason's impiety.

(2 Maccabees 4:24) 
Antiochus, while preparing for an expedition into Egypt, heard that a disturbance had occurred in the city of Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 4:25) 
And that those who were with Jason had fled the city and had acted injuriously in the holy temple.

(2 Maccabees 4:26) 
When he heard this, he thought Egypt had been conquered, and he went up in a rage and seized the city, and ordered his soldiers not to spare anyone in the city and to kill those who were encountered.

(2 Maccabees 4:27) 
And entering the temple, he stole the gold and silver vessels, the utensils, and all the treasures he found there.

(2 Maccabees 4:28) 
And taking everything, he went back to his own land and committed a great slaughter.

(2 Maccabees 4:29) 
And there was great mourning and lamentation in Israel.

(2 Maccabees 4:30) 
And there were the leaders and elders who mourned and were grieved in spirit, and who sat at the gates of the city, who were distressed and filled with sorrow.

(2 Maccabees 4:31) 
It happened that those in the city, and those in the mountains, who were also robbers, and who had taken plunder, and all those in the city who had gathered to fight, and who were impious, and who did every evil deed.

(2 Maccabees 4:32) 
And the king ordered them to be in the temple, to be struck and killed, and those who were over all, and those in the temple who had killed, were killed, and then they came to war.

(2 Maccabees 4:33) 
And there were many of the impious over them, who were also wounded, and those who were in the city, and those who were in the temple, who were also killed.

(2 Maccabees 4:34) 
And he ordered throughout all the cities that all those who were in the city should make sacrifices and offer to idols.

(2 Maccabees 4:35) 
And from the temple in Jerusalem, they took away the altar and burned it, and they made seats, statues, and idols in it.

(2 Maccabees 4:36) 
And they sacrificed pigs on the altar and poured out blood, and there was no one to bury the dead.

(2 Maccabees 4:37) 
And great disgrace was cast upon them, and a great abomination was committed against Israel.

(2 Maccabees 4:38) 
And many fled from the city and left their wives, children, brothers, and parents, and went into the mountains, to hiding places, to caves, and to other solitary places.

(2 Maccabees 4:39) 
Then there were many who were dying and lying in the city and in the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 4:40) 
And great wrath was poured out upon them, and a great judgment took place.

(2 Maccabees 4:41) 
And Judas Maccabeus and those who were with him, on the mountain, and those who were with him, to fight against the impious, and to fight, and to strike, and to kill.

(2 Maccabees 4:42) 
And they gathered together and placed each one in his place, and they took up arms and said, "It is better for us to die than to see the wickedness of the wicked and the holy things defiled."

(2 Maccabees 4:43) 
And they went to war with the impious and killed them.

(2 Maccabees 4:44) 
And quickly the impious fled from their presence.

(2 Maccabees 4:45) 
And they pursued them and killed and destroyed the impious, and they took vengeance from their hands, and they purified the holy things.

(2 Maccabees 4:46) 
And they purified the temple, the altar, and all the vessels, and they hung up in it those things that were defiled.

(2 Maccabees 4:47) 
And they offered in it the burnt offering, praise, and glory, and they said, "Lord, Lord God, who made the universe and the earth, and who is the Lord of all things."

(2 Maccabees 4:48) 
Send now your spirit and sanctify us, and send your light and strike those who are impious and their deeds.

(2 Maccabees 4:49) 
And after these things, they pursued and established, and they took vengeance on all the nations, and they killed the impious.

(2 Maccabees 4:50) 
And after this, they had peace, and they did all things according to the law of God.

(2 Maccabees 5:1) 
Around this time, Antiochus came back from Persia and arrived in the city of Antioch.

(2 Maccabees 5:2) 
And when he entered, he wanted to go into the temple, and his enemies attacked him, causing a disturbance.

(2 Maccabees 5:3) 
Because he was forbidden to enter, he became angry and departed.

(2 Maccabees 5:4) 
Upon his return, his fury flared, and he ordered the Jewish temple to be struck without pause.

(2 Maccabees 5:5) 
Then, many people came out and gathered around him.

(2 Maccabees 5:6) 
He commanded the men to be prepared. Quickly they entered and struck the city, killing many.

(2 Maccabees 5:7) 
They seized many spoils and set the city on fire.

(2 Maccabees 5:8) 
They demolished homes and tore down the surrounding walls.

(2 Maccabees 5:9) 
They took women and children captive and seized livestock.

(2 Maccabees 5:10) 
In the Holy Temple, they plundered the gold, silver, and valuable vessels they found there.

(2 Maccabees 5:11) 
They took everything and went back to their own land, causing great slaughter.

(2 Maccabees 5:12) 
There was great mourning in Israel.

(2 Maccabees 5:13) 
The leaders and elders groaned; young men and girls mourned; and the women lost their beauty.

(2 Maccabees 5:14) 
Every groom assumed the lament, and the bride was as if in mourning.

(2 Maccabees 5:15) 
The lands trembled because of their inhabitants, and the whole house of Jacob was confounded.

(2 Maccabees 5:16) 
After two years, the king sent a tax collector to the cities of Judea, and he came to Jerusalem with a large multitude.

(2 Maccabees 5:17) 
He spoke words of peace, but he deceived them. He struck the city with a great plague.

(2 Maccabees 5:18) 
He killed many of the people and scattered their spoils.

(2 Maccabees 5:19) 
He took away the ornaments of Jerusalem and put them in his own cities, and he destroyed Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 5:20) 
He led women and children into captivity and took possession of the livestock.

(2 Maccabees 5:21) 
They built a city of David with a large, strong wall, solid towers, and it became a citadel for them.

(2 Maccabees 5:22) 
They placed a sinful people there, wicked men; and they established themselves within it.

(2 Maccabees 5:23) 
They put weapons there, gathered food, stored arms there, and they uttered blasphemies, making it a snare for them.

(2 Maccabees 5:24) 
They spread out before the temple, surrounded it on all sides, and it became a wicked enemy to them.

(2 Maccabees 5:25) 
They poured out the blood of the innocent around the sanctuary, and the sanctuary was defiled, and the sons of strangers were around the temple, and the gentiles lived with the prostitutes and worked with them.

(2 Maccabees 5:26) 
The Jews were not allowed to enter, nor to observe the law or the commandments of God, because of their wickedness.

(2 Maccabees 5:27) 
Also, all of its honor was taken away, and all its glory was turned into disgrace.

(2 Maccabees 5:28) 
And the temple of the gentiles was full of luxury, banquets, and fornications. Women were with the gentiles in the temple, and things were done both around and within the sacred things that were forbidden.

(2 Maccabees 5:29) 
And the heart of Judah was troubled, and as he departed from the temple, the whole city was full of confusion.

(2 Maccabees 5:30) 
And all the streets resounded with the voice of those crying out, and everyone groaned together.

(2 Maccabees 6:1) 
Not long after, the king sent elders from Athens to force the Jews to abandon their ancestral laws and to cease living according to God’s laws:

(2 Maccabees 6:2) 
They were to defile the Temple in Jerusalem, dedicating it to foreign gods, setting up altars and temples for those gods, and offering unclean pigs as sacrifices.

(2 Maccabees 6:3) 
When this happened, many in the Jewish population agreed with them, offering sacrifices to idols and violating the Sabbath.

(2 Maccabees 6:4) 
The king sent written commands by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judea, ordering them to follow practices that were foreign to their ancestral laws.

(2 Maccabees 6:5) 
They forced the people and gave them the commands to offer sacrifices to idols, defiling themselves through the sacrifices.

(2 Maccabees 6:6) 
But those who remained in Judea, and who were left behind, faced great tribulations because no one had the ability to escape from a given place.

(2 Maccabees 6:7) 
When this happened, many Jews agreed with them and sacrificed to idols in every way, profaning the Sabbath.

(2 Maccabees 6:8) 
Afterward, he brought about the deaths of many who did not agree, but persevered in Judaism and forbade such practices.

(2 Maccabees 6:9) 
On the fifteenth day of the month of Casleu, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they built the abominable idol in the Temple and in the cities of Judea all around.

(2 Maccabees 6:10) 
They sacrificed on the day of the idol’s birth and on the first day of each month, according to the king's command, at the altar.

(2 Maccabees 6:11) 
Those in Jerusalem were forced to pretend and to offer sacrifices, crowning themselves for Bacchus.

(2 Maccabees 6:12) 
But there was great sorrow over Israel.

(2 Maccabees 6:13) 
For those who pretended did not refuse to eat the unclean things.

(2 Maccabees 6:14) 
Therefore, many Jews fled to hide themselves and to attack those who were doing those things.

(2 Maccabees 6:15) 
And on the ninth day of the month of Casleu, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they rose up to offer sacrifices, sacrificing at the altar that was above the altar and they killed according to the king's command.

(2 Maccabees 6:16) 
The women who had circumcised their sons made themselves known, and they were hung by the neck throughout the city.

(2 Maccabees 6:17) 
And they destroyed others along with their families and those who were with them, and they killed them on every day.

(2 Maccabees 6:18) 
So, many Israelites decided in their hearts not to eat unclean things.

(2 Maccabees 6:19) 
They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food and to violate the holy law and so they died.

(2 Maccabees 6:20) 
And great wrath came upon them.

(2 Maccabees 6:21) 
Two women were also brought forth because they had circumcised their sons.

(2 Maccabees 6:22) 
When they seized their sons, they hung the women from their breasts, ripped them open, and killed their sons at the same time.

(2 Maccabees 6:23) 
But others, along with their sons, gave themselves up, and they died frequently.

(2 Maccabees 6:24) 
Then, the Lord was angry with them, because their sins were the cause.

(2 Maccabees 6:25) 
But Machabeus gathered those who were with him, hiding in the mountains and forests, and he struck those who were in Judea, attacking those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 7:1) 
This also happened: Seven brothers and their mother were arrested. The king tortured them with whips and cords to force them to eat pork, which the Law forbade.

(2 Maccabees 7:2) 
But the first brother said: "What do you want to know from us? We are ready to die rather than disobey the laws of our fathers."

(2 Maccabees 7:3) 
The enraged king commanded the fires and frying pans to be heated. He then ordered the brothers to be tortured by their tongues, hands, and feet.

(2 Maccabees 7:4) 
While they were enduring this torture, the other brothers said: "What are you looking for? What do you want to know? We are ready to die."

(2 Maccabees 7:5) 
The second brother, at the point of death by torture, said: "You wicked man, you may end our present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up again to eternal life because we die for His laws."

(2 Maccabees 7:6) 
After him, the third brother, who was mocked, quickly extended his tongue, and his hands with a courageous boldness, saying: "I received these from God, and because of His laws I despise them; and I hope to receive them again."

(2 Maccabees 7:7) 
Even the king and those with him were amazed at the youths' resolve. They despised the tortures and threw away their present life.

(2 Maccabees 7:8) 
When the third brother died, the fourth was tortured in the same way. As he was at the point of death, he said: "It is good to die at the hands of men, but we have hope of being raised again by God. But for you, there will be no resurrection to life."

(2 Maccabees 7:9) 
Then they brought the fifth brother and tortured him. But he, looking at the king, said: "Although you have the power of men, you are corruptible and you do what you will. Do not think that our race has been abandoned by God:"

(2 Maccabees 7:10) 
Hold on and see His great works, and how He will test them and punish you."

(2 Maccabees 7:11) 
Then the sixth brother said, as he was dying: "Do not be mistaken: for we suffer these things for ourselves because we have sinned against God, for which reason these wonders have happened to us."

(2 Maccabees 7:12) 
The mother was even more marvelous and worthy of memory. For she, when she saw one day in the presence of her seven sons dying, endured this courageously, and with a good spirit, she had hope in the Lord.

(2 Maccabees 7:13) 
Exhorting each of them in their native language, with wisdom, she united the youths’ understanding in piety. Saying: "I do not know how you appeared in my womb: for I did not give you spirit, soul, and sense, nor did I form each of you."

(2 Maccabees 7:14) 
But the Creator of the universe, who formed the birth of man, and who is the inventor of all things, He will restore spirit and life to you in mercy, just as you now despise your souls because of His laws."

(2 Maccabees 7:15) 
Antiochus, however, thought that he was being scorned, and suspected words of reproach. He tried to persuade the remaining son not only with words, but also with an oath, and with friendship, kindness, riches, and authority, and by making him renounce the laws.

(2 Maccabees 7:16) 
But since he did not care about anything, he summoned the mother and exhorted her to follow the youth’s advice and persuade him for his safety.

(2 Maccabees 7:17) 
But the mother, as he was persuading him much, and he was not obeying her, said: "My son, have mercy on me, who carried you for nine months in my womb, and nursed and raised you up to this age, and provided for you."

(2 Maccabees 7:18) 
I beg you, son, look at the universe and the earth, and everything in them, and consider: and know that God made them from nothing, and the race of men."

(2 Maccabees 7:19) 
So, do not fear this executioner, but, being worthy of your brothers, accept death so that I may receive you in mercy."

(2 Maccabees 7:20) 
While she was speaking these things, the youth said: "What are you waiting for? For I do these things, not obeying the commands of the fathers, but of God."

(2 Maccabees 7:21) 
And immediately, he was tortured, so that he might also die. As he died, he said: "Dying at the hands of men, but through the hope of resurrection from God, I am going to eternal life. But as for you, may you never rise again."

(2 Maccabees 7:22) 
After the brothers and the mother, he said: "But I, through the power of Him, am with you, and with the seed of my brothers, and with their souls."

(2 Maccabees 7:23) 
After these words, they and the mother received death in various ways.

(2 Maccabees 8:1) 
Judas Maccabaeus and his soldiers secretly entered the fortresses and called together their relatives. They gathered about six thousand men, including those who remained loyal in Judea and those who had deserted to join them.

(2 Maccabees 8:2) 
They prayed to the Lord to look with favor on the people and to see the injury they were suffering.

(2 Maccabees 8:3) 
They said to Maccabaeus: “What shall we do, now that God has given our enemies such power, to attack us?”

(2 Maccabees 8:4) 
Maccabaeus said in response: “Let us pray and call on the Lord. He may, perhaps, relent. He will do whatever He wishes, and if He doesn't, then He does as He wills.”

(2 Maccabees 8:5) 
After gathering the army and preparing for battle, he said: “It is better to die in battle than to see the evils of our people and our holy places.”

(2 Maccabees 8:6) 
This was the will of heaven.

(2 Maccabees 8:7) 
Then, exhorting them and giving them the watchword, he placed the most valiant men, fifty to a company, and put them in charge.

(2 Maccabees 8:8) 
He told them, “Don’t be afraid in this battle. Let us fight for our souls and avenge ourselves.”

(2 Maccabees 8:9) 
He gave the signal, and they attacked Nicanor in the center, who immediately fell in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:10) 
They fell together with the majority of the Syrian army, and the rest fled.

(2 Maccabees 8:11) 
They captured their spoils. They cut off Nicanor's head and his hand, which he had so proudly raised. They brought them and hung them near the fortress of Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 8:12) 
The Jews greatly rejoiced and glorified this day, and they decreed that this day should be celebrated annually.

(2 Maccabees 8:13) 
Then, gathering together, they said, “May God be praised, for He saves His people.”

(2 Maccabees 8:14) 
They attacked and struck down those who were with Timothy and Bacchides, who were besieging them. They inflicted a great defeat, and the enemy were wounded and fled.

(2 Maccabees 8:15) 
Judas Maccabaeus stationed men in Jerusalem, who were besieging the fortress. He also stationed men in Gazara, Beth-zur, and the fortress. And he put others in charge of other locations.

(2 Maccabees 8:16) 
Timothy and Bacchides then sent their troops to fight against the Jews and they met in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:17) 
In the battle that followed, about twenty thousand men of Timothy’s army were killed.

(2 Maccabees 8:18) 
But Timothy himself escaped with a few men, and they came to a certain fortress called Gazara, where Chereas was.

(2 Maccabees 8:19) 
Then the Jewish leaders with Maccabaeus laid siege to the fortress for twenty days, with a great assault.

(2 Maccabees 8:20) 
They set up siege towers, war machines, and catapults and they assaulted the place.

(2 Maccabees 8:21) 
Those inside fell into their hands. They set fire to the fortress and burned those inside, and they fell.

(2 Maccabees 8:22) 
Then they went to another fortress and fought against Timothy, who was there.

(2 Maccabees 8:23) 
He gathered about one hundred and twenty thousand men from his army and put him and the others with him in battle.

(2 Maccabees 8:24) 
They fought against Maccabaeus, and as they were about to begin, about twenty thousand men of Timothy’s army were killed. Timothy fled to a fortress where his brother Chereas was.

(2 Maccabees 8:25) 
Then Maccabaeus and those with him besieged the fortress and struck it.

(2 Maccabees 8:26) 
Fearing them, Timothy immediately sent to them, promising to release them and all their possessions, and he swore he would never harm them in any way.

(2 Maccabees 8:27) 
Maccabaeus let them go, but not according to the promise. He killed Chereas, his brother, and Timothy, and he gave the fortress to the citizens.

(2 Maccabees 8:28) 
After this victory they went to Caraca and Charecensi, and to the Jews who were in that place. They thought they were not loyal, and they tried to attack them.

(2 Maccabees 8:29) 
But those inside, seeing their enemies fighting against them, cried out to Maccabaeus, begging him, and saying, “We are righteous, and we are not your enemies.”

(2 Maccabees 8:30) 
Crying out they gave testimony, saying, “We call God as our witness, and we are faithful to you and not to your enemies.”

(2 Maccabees 8:31) 
Maccabaeus received them in friendship and did not cease to harm them, but gathered their people, up to thirty thousand.

(2 Maccabees 8:32) 
He put them to work in the service of the Jews, and he returned with them to Jerusalem and freed the city.

(2 Maccabees 8:33) 
In Jerusalem, he killed those among them who had gone out, because they were in sins and had done evil.

(2 Maccabees 8:34) 
He placed a fortress in Jerusalem with men and fortified it, and they and others guarded it.

(2 Maccabees 8:35) 
And they sent troops to Beth-zur against them and attacked them, and they killed about five thousand men.

(2 Maccabees 8:36) 
Judas, seeing their deeds and their attack, gathered the people to praise the Lord, who saves Israel.

(2 Maccabees 8:37) 
He gathered them and went out against them and struck them.

(2 Maccabees 8:38) 
In the battle, he killed Ptolemy, the son of Dori, and those with him.

(2 Maccabees 8:39) 
He stationed troops in the fortress, and with all of Israel they praised him daily, who is their savior.

(2 Maccabees 9:1) 
So, King Antiochus then departed for the regions of Persia with a great army, because he heard that there was an army in Persia that was resisting him.

(2 Maccabees 9:2) 
For a great problem, which was being handled by the Greeks there, and because there were those in that region who opposed him.

(2 Maccabees 9:3) 
So he departed to Persia with those who were with him, and he heard that there was great wealth in the temple of Nanaea, in Persia.

(2 Maccabees 9:4) 
And he came, and he hoped to take the city, and to obtain the wealth. Because he sent to the city and he obtained it.

(2 Maccabees 9:5) 
So when Antiochus came, and those who were with him, the temple priests immediately came there, and they showed him the reason why they had come.

(2 Maccabees 9:6) 
And they said: “Behold, there is much wealth, which has been entrusted to us. But take it immediately, and do what has been commanded to you.”

(2 Maccabees 9:7) 
And he said, “Immediately, and with haste.” And he arranged it. But when Antiochus entered the temple, and those who were with him, the priests, carrying it, entered.

(2 Maccabees 9:8) 
And when Antiochus, and those who were with him, entered, immediately the temple priests, shouting, and at once in the ashes and on the ground, made a fire.

(2 Maccabees 9:9) 
And when this had been done, and this that was done, they perished, not moderately, and those who were with him, and he was struck by swords, and without fear.

(2 Maccabees 9:10) 
And the whole city, with great exultation, and all who were in it, did it to him.

(2 Maccabees 9:11) 
On the fourth day, he was in great pain, and those who were with him were saddened.

(2 Maccabees 9:12) 
And when this was done, those who were with him, who were his enemies, said: “How powerful and terrifying was this man!”

(2 Maccabees 9:13) 
And Antiochus died, in great pain, and he cried out.

(2 Maccabees 9:14) 
And it happened that many of those who were with him fell, and were killed, and those who were with him. And Philip, who was educated with Antiochus, spoke about his son, and brought him, and he reigned.

(2 Maccabees 9:15) 
And Philip reigned. And he was sick, and troubled, and all who were with him were saddened.

(2 Maccabees 10:1) 
Judas, who was called Maccabeus, and his companions went into the villages secretly, and then arrested those who were there. They gathered those who had not deserted from Judea until they met the forces opposing them.

(2 Maccabees 10:2) 
They called upon the Lord, terrified the surrounding nations, and attacked them. They burned down their fortress and captured it.

(2 Maccabees 10:3) 
When it was time for battle, Judas, forming his company, chose 3,000 men and sent them into battle against Bacchides and his army.

(2 Maccabees 10:4) 
Fearing Bacchides, they withdrew from the camp. Of the 3,000, only 2,680 men remained.

(2 Maccabees 10:5) 
When Judas saw those who had withdrawn, he pursued them.

(2 Maccabees 10:6) 
He turned them to fight, and killed 3,000 men. He then advanced to Bacchides' camp and fought.

(2 Maccabees 10:7) 
Bacchides, fearing his strength, crossed over to the place called Azotus, and then they went with him to fight Judas.

(2 Maccabees 10:8) 
A large crowd gathered and formed a council. They told those with Judas that Judas and his brothers had been killed.

(2 Maccabees 10:9) 
When Judas heard these words, as they were on their way, he said: "There shall be no mercy for me, but we shall break into them."

(2 Maccabees 10:10) 
He fought against them in the city and killed about 20,000 men. The rest they forced to flee into a castle in Azotus.

(2 Maccabees 10:11) 
Taking the spoils, they burned Azotus and everything in it. Then they returned to Judea.

(2 Maccabees 10:12) 
Bacchides and Judas met in the field called Bersa, with Judas having few men.

(2 Maccabees 10:13) 
The men with Judas were exhausted, and when they saw the large crowd, they were afraid and could not stand. Judas and his companions fought to the death.

(2 Maccabees 10:14) 
The men with Judas saw that his brothers and all who were with him had died. They followed them.

(2 Maccabees 10:15) 
They fled into the land.

(2 Maccabees 10:16) 
On the other side, Bacchides and his leaders set up camp and encamped in the land of Judea.

(2 Maccabees 10:17) 
The Jews mourned and said, "How have the strong ones perished, who saved Israel!"

(2 Maccabees 10:18) 
The rest of Judas’ deeds, his wars, and the acts of valor he performed are not written in this book, because they were too great.

(2 Maccabees 10:19) 
After the death of Judas, those who were not pious arose and stirred up all sorts of evil throughout all the borders of Israel.

(2 Maccabees 10:20) 
All wickedness gathered against them. Then those who committed sins arose, and evil conspiracies followed.

(2 Maccabees 10:21) 
A great famine occurred, and the land failed, and all the multitude gathered together. Then Simon rose up, fought for his people, and offered his life for his nation.

(2 Maccabees 10:22) 
He gathered his friends and sent them forth. He gathered those of his own family and strengthened them in justice.

(2 Maccabees 10:23) 
He multiplied the works of the people, and the land was glorified, and all evil was driven out of the land.

(2 Maccabees 10:24) 
He arose in the sight of his people and avenged his nation. He gathered the works of the people and avenged it.

(2 Maccabees 10:25) 
In his days, he prospered in his works and extended his borders.

(2 Maccabees 11:1) 
After this, Judas Maccabaeus and his men entered the villages in secret, and they summoned those in Judea who had not deserted to Philip. And they observed the Sabbath day.

(2 Maccabees 11:2) 
Later, they gathered and made war against Philip. After Philip was defeated and killed with great valor, and the rest who were with him...

(2 Maccabees 11:3) 
Judas and his brothers, along with the best of the Israelites, resolved on that day and followed this course:

(2 Maccabees 11:4) 
They said: “Behold, our enemies are defeated! Let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it.”

(2 Maccabees 11:5) 
Then, the whole multitude gathered and went up to Mount Zion.

(2 Maccabees 11:6) 
They saw the sanctuary deserted, the altar defiled, the gates burned, and plants growing in the courtyards as in a forest or a mountain, and the chambers destroyed.

(2 Maccabees 11:7) 
They tore their garments and mourned with a great lamentation; they put on sackcloth and placed ashes on their heads.

(2 Maccabees 11:8) 
And they fell to the ground and cried out with a loud voice to the universe.

(2 Maccabees 11:9) 
Then Judas ordered the men to fight against those in the fortress until they had cleansed the sanctuary.

(2 Maccabees 11:10) 
He chose priests without blemish and of good will, and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the stones of defilement to an unclean place.

(2 Maccabees 11:11) 
They considered what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which had been defiled.

(2 Maccabees 11:12) 
They gave good counsel to tear it down, lest it be reproached to them that the Gentiles had defiled it, and they demolished the altar.

(2 Maccabees 11:13) 
They placed the stones in a fitting place on the mountain of the house until, that is, a prophet should come and give an answer about them.

(2 Maccabees 11:14) 
Then they took whole stones according to the law and built an altar like the former one.

(2 Maccabees 11:15) 
And they built the sanctuary and the interior of the house, and they sanctified the courts.

(2 Maccabees 11:16) 
They made new sacred vessels and brought in the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:17) 
And they burned incense on the altar, and they lit the lamps that were on the lampstand, and they gave light in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:18) 
They placed the bread on the table and hung the veils, and they finished the work they had done.

(2 Maccabees 11:19) 
On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month was the dedication of the temple.

(2 Maccabees 11:20) 
And they offered sacrifices with song, with harps, cymbals, and drums.

(2 Maccabees 11:21) 
And the priests fell on their faces before the temple during the dedication of the temple, and the Levites sang with harps and songs in a great chant.

(2 Maccabees 11:22) 
And all the people adored.

(2 Maccabees 11:23) 
And they sacrificed burnt offerings and offered sacrifices and peace offerings.

(2 Maccabees 11:24) 
And Judas celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and he offered burnt offerings and libations with joy and gladness.

(2 Maccabees 11:25) 
They also renewed the ornaments of the temple itself, both inside and out.

(2 Maccabees 11:26) 
On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year, they rose early.

(2 Maccabees 11:27) 
And they sacrificed according to the law on the altar of burnt offerings, which they had built.

(2 Maccabees 11:28) 
And according to the time and day when the Gentiles had defiled it, it was dedicated with songs, harps, cymbals, and drums.

(2 Maccabees 11:29) 
And all the people fell on their faces, and adored, and they blessed the one in the universe who had given them success.

(2 Maccabees 11:30) 
And they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days in joy, just as they were reminded of the feast of the tabernacles; because recently, they had lived in the tabernacles of the forests and endured wild beasts.

(2 Maccabees 11:31) 
Because of this, they cried out with firm shouts, and they implored the one who had given them success to preserve them to the end.

(2 Maccabees 11:32) 
And Judas and his brothers established for the whole community of the Jews that the days of the dedication of the altar should be celebrated annually with joy and gladness for eight days, at their appointed times.

(2 Maccabees 11:33) 
Moreover, this time, in which they were in Persia, and with King Artaxerxes, and in the time of Maccabaeus...

(2 Maccabees 11:34) 
And they sent letters to the Jews who were in Egypt, to all the provinces of the Jews, greetings from the Jewish brothers—to the Jews who were in Judea, and those who were, greetings.

(2 Maccabees 11:35) 
On the dedication of the altar, and on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year...

(2 Maccabees 11:36) 
We declare all the events that occurred in Maccabees and with his companions, and of their strength and great endurance.

(2 Maccabees 11:37) 
How they affected the Jews in war, and how they fought with courage for the Jewish law, how, for that reason, they were enemies, and how they purified the holy temple and the sanctuary, and they dedicated the altar.

(2 Maccabees 11:38) 
And we will narrate what was done about the others, and about these, in those same times.

(2 Maccabees 11:39) 
And let these things have been said in words; now, therefore, we will bring the speech to an end.

(2 Maccabees 12:1) 
But Judas Maccabaeus and his men prayed to the Lord, begging Him to send an enemy against their enemies.

(2 Maccabees 12:2) 
A surprise attack was launched against them, in which many were wounded, and the rest fled to the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 12:3) 
Then Simon, who was one of their leaders, took his men, and selecting some of their number, he sent them to the king to bring him into the mountains.

(2 Maccabees 12:4) 
He prepared a path for his men, anticipating the enemy, and rushed upon them.

(2 Maccabees 12:5) 
Those with Timothy saw this and, filled with fear, took refuge.

(2 Maccabees 12:6) 
They cried out to him and begged him to let them pass safely, for they were afraid.

(2 Maccabees 12:7) 
So he went to them and made peace with them, and they swore an oath that they would not cause any trouble.

(2 Maccabees 12:8) 
He struck Timothy and his men, and his brother Chereas, and the rest, and pursued them.

(2 Maccabees 12:9) 
They were prepared for war, and they gave battle from an ambush, and about twenty thousand men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:10) 
Timothy himself, and to his place, sent to prepare, and to another place against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:11) 
But Maccabaeus and those with him, divided into two groups, attacked those who were prepared, and they fought: and they were wounded, and the rest fled to the fortified places.

(2 Maccabees 12:12) 
They captured Timothy there, and his brother Chereas, and Apollonius. And after this they killed them, and wounded many with swords.

(2 Maccabees 12:13) 
Now the Passover was in the month of Xanti, and when it came, they celebrated it.

(2 Maccabees 12:14) 
After this, they went to a fortress that was under the mountains, named Garizim, and they killed many of those who were in it.

(2 Maccabees 12:15) 
And at this time, those who were in Bethsura, having been in the garrison, took refuge against them, and they prayed to the Lord.

(2 Maccabees 12:16) 
And they fought against them, and gave them their hand: and at this time, there were those who were reproached by the impious among them.

(2 Maccabees 12:17) 
And they celebrated the holy things with their garrisons, and there were those who were from Bethsura.

(2 Maccabees 12:18) 
For it was the day of celebrating the holy things, in the month of Xanti, and in the month before that, which we mentioned before.

(2 Maccabees 12:19) 
Now those who were in Jerusalem followed those who had been in Galilee, who in the same month of Xanti, were celebrating.

(2 Maccabees 12:20) 
And after rising up, they surrounded the camp of Judas, who had fought, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:21) 
And they came to Jerusalem, and supplicating, they prayed that they might be worthy, and with virtue, and to the end they would arrive.

(2 Maccabees 12:22) 
And after this, they went to the camp, and in it, were those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:23) 
And when they came near, crying out, and their gods, they implored that they would send for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:24) 
But Judas, and those with him, praying, asked for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:25) 
And when the prayer had been made, and they cried out, the impious were there, and there were some of the gentiles, who were in them, and were prepared for battle.

(2 Maccabees 12:26) 
And Judas and those with him fought, and were confused, and fled.

(2 Maccabees 12:27) 
And after this, some of them were wounded, and about thirty men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:28) 
And Judas, and those with him, followed and returned to their camp: and then, crying out and supplicating, they prayed.

(2 Maccabees 12:29) 
And they came to their camp, and after this, they fled, and were killed by those who were against them.

(2 Maccabees 12:30) 
And on that day, there were those near the village, which is under the mountains, named Adasa: and there they were in prayer and cried out: and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:31) 
But Judas and those with him, after this, came: and with them, they cried out, and praying, and after this, they cried out.

(2 Maccabees 12:32) 
And they killed, and pierced, and on that day, about three hundred men were killed.

(2 Maccabees 12:33) 
And Judas, and those with him, returned and took the spoils.

(2 Maccabees 12:34) 
And after this, they were from Jericho, and in Jericho, and around, and after this, they were from Adasa.

(2 Maccabees 12:35) 
And they returned, and took the spoils. And after this, they were from Jerusalem, and after this, from them, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:36) 
And they gave to him, who was over them, from Jerusalem, and those who were from Jerusalem, and around, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:37) 
And when they came to the land of Judea, and from them, and in the land of Judea, and after this, they were from Bethsura, and in Bethsura, and around, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:38) 
And they came, and after this, they were from Jerusalem, and from them, and in Jerusalem, and to the temple, and in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 12:39) 
And in those days, and then, they prayed to the Lord, and after this, they prayed for them.

(2 Maccabees 12:40) 
And after this, the Jews, and those with him, and after this, they prayed, and asked for them, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:41) 
And then, they were in Jerusalem, and praying, and after this, they were in the temple.

(2 Maccabees 12:42) 
And when they arrived, they gave them money, and sacrificing, and after this, they sacrificed.

(2 Maccabees 12:43) 
And when they had finished, and they gave all, and after this, they gave money, and then, they were and sacrificed, and gave and sacrificed, and took the spoils.

(2 Maccabees 12:44) 
And after this, when they had completed all things, and all things, and after this, they gave all, and sacrificed, and when they had come to the end, and in those days, and after this, and in them, they were, and then, and before, they were.

(2 Maccabees 12:45) 
And those in Jerusalem, with the Jews, and to the temple, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:46) 
And Judas and those with him, came to them, and after this, they prayed, and after this, they asked, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:47) 
And in those days, the feast of dedication, and in the feast days, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:48) 
And in them, and then, they praised and gave thanks to God, and praised, and in the feast days, and after this.

(2 Maccabees 12:49) 
And in them, and then, the Jews, who were there, and who were there, and after this, and in Jerusalem, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 12:50) 
And in those days, after this, and in Jerusalem, and praying, and for them, and after this, and in Jerusalem.

(2 Maccabees 13:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-ninth year, Judas learned that Antiochus Eupator was coming with an army into Judea,

(2 Maccabees 13:2) 
and he brought with him a great force. With him was Alcimus, whom the king had made high priest.

(2 Maccabees 13:3) 
He had been disgraced in his own time because of his betrayal, and he began to strike the people and to kill those who were doing his work.

(2 Maccabees 13:4) 
All the wicked men gathered together and gathered wicked men to themselves, and they became strong, and they controlled the land, and they inflicted a severe plague upon Israel.

(2 Maccabees 13:5) 
And Judas, seeing that the evils had increased, and that the army was in the camps against them, and that the time was approaching for them to advance,

(2 Maccabees 13:6) 
commanded the rest of the people, saying: Do not be afraid of the face of the multitude, nor be terrified by the onslaught of the army.

(2 Maccabees 13:7) 
Remember the great salvation that was made for our fathers in the sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with his army.

(2 Maccabees 13:8) 
And now, if we cry out to the sky, God will have mercy on us and will remember His covenant, and He will crush this army before our faces today.

(2 Maccabees 13:9) 
So they terrified them, and they charged, and the adversaries were thrown into confusion.

(2 Maccabees 13:10) 
And they struck down of them on that day about five thousand men, and the horsemen and foot soldiers were wounded.

(2 Maccabees 13:11) 
And seeing that they had begun to resist, and had become bold, they boldly engaged against them.

(2 Maccabees 13:12) 
And they were confused, and many wounded fell from the rest; others fled into the camp.

(2 Maccabees 13:13) 
And in the camp was Nicanor, who had come from Judea and had been sent by the king.

(2 Maccabees 13:14) 
Hearing that the men of the Jews were stronger, he was terrified and no longer dared to strike.

(2 Maccabees 13:15) 
And on the Sabbath day, Judas went out with his men, and the war flared up.

(2 Maccabees 13:16) 
And they said among themselves, “What shall we do, since these Jews do not cease, but go to fight?”

(2 Maccabees 13:17) 
Then Nicanor commanded on the Sabbath day that they should lay down their arms and go out.

(2 Maccabees 13:18) 
And they went around to the Jews and fought against them, and about three hundred men fell from them on that day.

(2 Maccabees 13:19) 
Judas and his men went to bury the dead, and they began to place them with their fathers.

(2 Maccabees 13:20) 
And they found under the tunics of the slain men the vessels of the idols of Jamnia, which the Jews were forbidden to use according to the law.

(2 Maccabees 13:21) 
And it became clear to everyone that they had fallen for this reason.

(2 Maccabees 13:22) 
Therefore, all blessed the Lord, the just judge, who reveals hidden things.

(2 Maccabees 13:23) 
And Judas, turning back, exhorted the people to guard themselves from sins, because they had seen with their own eyes what had happened on account of the sin of those who had been killed.

(2 Maccabees 13:24) 
Then, gathering them individually, he sent twelve men to Rome to make friendship with them, and to receive help from them.

(2 Maccabees 13:25) 
And he read in them letters, in which they were commanded to receive the Jewish people into friendship and to give them aid if there was any need.

(2 Maccabees 13:26) 
Then the Macedonians went out to war, and Judas and his men besieged Casphin, and they fought.

(2 Maccabees 13:27) 
And those in the camp fled within the walls, and the Jews captured the city.

(2 Maccabees 13:28) 
And when day came, Judas gathered two thousand men from them, and divided them into two divisions for battle.

(2 Maccabees 13:29) 
And they engaged in battle, and they killed about eight thousand of them, and all the rest fled into the land of Galathi.

(2 Maccabees 13:30) 
On that day, Timothy, who was over the camps, was captured by them and was greatly tormented.

(2 Maccabees 13:31) 
And his brothers gathered around him, and they beseeched him and let him go, for they were afraid.

(2 Maccabees 14:1) 
In the one hundred forty-ninth year of the Seleucid era, Demetrius learned that the Romans and those in Asia were fearful of the Jews and were alarmed by them.

(2 Maccabees 14:2) 
So he gathered his wicked men and went out on a military campaign.

(2 Maccabees 14:3) 
He came to the land of Judea and marched toward the city of Jerusalem. He then fought against a large army.

(2 Maccabees 14:4) 
And Macabeus (Judas Maccabaeus) set up camp against him and against his army. Seeing his army coming, he prayed to the Lord and said:

(2 Maccabees 14:5) 
“O Lord, you have always gone before our fathers in battle, throwing down their enemies and giving them into our hands.

(2 Maccabees 14:6) 
Give our army the strength to fight and send a good angel before us to encourage us.

(2 Maccabees 14:7) 
May they be struck with fear and terror by the power of your arm, and let those who blaspheme your holy name perish.”

(2 Maccabees 14:8) 
The battle began, and many soldiers of Demetrius fell and were routed. Judas pursued them from the camp as far as Gaza and the surrounding territories.

(2 Maccabees 14:9) 
The battle brought great defeat on that day.

(2 Maccabees 14:10) 
Now, Jason, who had transported the Jews to his own city, and who had treated them badly and unjustly, betrayed his own people.

(2 Maccabees 14:11) 
Those who were persecuting the Jews along all the roads, and the citizens as well, killed them all and seized their silver and gold.

(2 Maccabees 14:12) 
They took the silver to the city and the rest to Jerusalem. Jason fled from Jerusalem to the city.

(2 Maccabees 14:13) 
The one who was defeated fled to the city of the Arabs and was routed and driven out by Aretas, the prince of the Arabs.

(2 Maccabees 14:14) 
Jason was pursued into the city, where he behaved wickedly, and was driven out into exile.

(2 Maccabees 14:15) 
Then, about three hundred Jews who had gone on the road to the city were captured and handed over to their enemies.

(2 Maccabees 14:16) 
Meanwhile, Menelaus became so wicked and was a most cruel tyrant. He gave orders for the killing of his own citizens.

(2 Maccabees 14:17) 
He entered Jerusalem with the wicked Antiochus, committing all of his evil deeds.

(2 Maccabees 14:18) 
He fell upon the city as if he were an enemy. He came with a scheme to do wrong and acted unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:19) 
He struck down many of the people and seized great spoils.

(2 Maccabees 14:20) 
Hearing this, Judas, who was fighting against Demetrius with his army, returned to the land of Judea and immediately went out to Berse and fought against Menelaus.

(2 Maccabees 14:21) 
He hid himself in Jerusalem and near the walls.

(2 Maccabees 14:22) 
While Judas was pressing the battle, the king sent soldiers to him.

(2 Maccabees 14:23) 
Menelaus was struck down and fell in battle, and Judas defeated him.

(2 Maccabees 14:24) 
When Judas went to the king, he pointed out the wickedness of those in the city.

(2 Maccabees 14:25) 
But when the king judged him, he ordered him to go to his death.

(2 Maccabees 14:26) 
For he had committed wickedness in the city, inflicting tortures and all kinds of crimes. Therefore, he was punished.

(2 Maccabees 14:27) 
And a crowd gathered around him and on his side, and they stoned him in the place where he had done wrong.

(2 Maccabees 14:28) 
Of those who were with Menelaus, many perished. He was now alone in Jerusalem, acting unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:29) 
When Jason came to trial and was sent to the Lacedaemonians, he was found guilty of acting unjustly.

(2 Maccabees 14:30) 
And those who sent him were punished, since he betrayed both himself and the one whom he had sent.

(2 Maccabees 14:31) 
When the king heard this, he was angry and punished them. Because they were from the city, he judged them and killed them.

(2 Maccabees 14:32) 
He killed many of the citizens and gave others to the soldiers to plunder. He cast out Jason, the wicked man, and the one who acted unjustly towards all, and he drove them into exile.

(2 Maccabees 14:33) 
He returned to Arabia and died in exile, and there was no one to bury him.

(2 Maccabees 14:34) 
And all those who acted against the law, against the holy things, and committed iniquities did not escape punishment.

(2 Maccabees 14:35) 
For even Demetrius, while fighting with his army, surrounded them. He was defeated by Macabeus and those with him and fled into the city.

(2 Maccabees 15:1) 
After this happened, Judas and his brothers were told that Antiochus Eupator had arrived in Judea with a large army,

(2 Maccabees 15:2) 
and with him was Lysias, his regent, commanding the most powerful part of the army: 110,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, 22 elephants, and 300 scythed chariots.

(2 Maccabees 15:3) 
Some Jews also came to him, requesting peace and hoping to avoid danger, and Lysias urged them forward.

(2 Maccabees 15:4) 
But he, acting with bad intentions and cruel desire, was invading Judea and the brothers who were mentioned previously.

(2 Maccabees 15:5) 
As he was approaching Jerusalem, a horseman, armed with golden armor, appeared in a vision from the sky, riding in front of him.

(2 Maccabees 15:6) 
Showing the mounted troop to Lysias, the horseman said, "Judas and his brothers were walking in this way, without fear."

(2 Maccabees 15:7) 
When Lysias saw this, they all fell from their horses, terrified, and were scattered.

(2 Maccabees 15:8) 
The Jews, however, were giving thanks to God, rejoicing in what He had done for them. Those who had been sent from the sky to them, were equipped with weapons, ready to fight.

(2 Maccabees 15:9) 
When they were close, they fought fiercely, and the enemies were wounded and scattered, and the rest fled.

(2 Maccabees 15:10) 
As Judas and his brothers were gaining glory and strength, he said, "Do not fight against your enemies, but remain in your place and worship the Lord together."

(2 Maccabees 15:11) 
Then, singing hymns in their presence and giving thanks to the Lord, who had acted wonderfully for them, brave and strong men arose and fought the battle, wounding more than 5,000 of the enemy.

(2 Maccabees 15:12) 
Seeing his armies defeated and the strongest soldiers fleeing, Antiochus Eupator became afraid and, against his will, agreed to peace with the Jews.

(2 Maccabees 15:13) 
The Jews, after agreeing to peace, handed over the weapons to their citizens and returned the garrisons, provisions, and everything they had taken to the camp.

(2 Maccabees 15:14) 
Antiochus and Lysias, after receiving everything, returned to the king through Judea with praise.

(2 Maccabees 15:15) 
After this, as they were returning to King Antiochus, a certain Philip, who was one of the king's advisors and was troubled, said to the king, "We don't control the kingdom; it's being governed with a garrison and wealth."

(2 Maccabees 15:16) 
But also, the Jews who fled from Judea are disturbing us and are adopting their customs."

(2 Maccabees 15:17) 
Therefore, I say, it is necessary for us to depart and make peace with the Jews. Otherwise, they and those who have helped them will harm us."

(2 Maccabees 15:18) 
After saying these things, Antiochus immediately became enraged and ordered Philip to be seized and killed, and he died many days later.

(2 Maccabees 15:19) 
After a great sacrifice, the Jews, and his sons, gathered to the destruction of the temple, and for this cause, they all came together.

(2 Maccabees 15:20) 
The gathering was made so that they would be seen, and the Jews, in their place, fought for the law and their homeland.

(2 Maccabees 15:21) 
Philip and those with him withdrew and fought, coming to the aid of those who were with the Jews.

(2 Maccabees 15:22) 
Then Judas, gathered with the other Jews in the appointed place, fought.

(2 Maccabees 15:23) 
And he shouted in their hearing: "God is just and strong! God is just and strong!"

(2 Maccabees 15:24) 
And he set up a banner, upon which there was a golden sign. Everyone who came forward in strength and danger, perished.

(2 Maccabees 15:25) 
The enemies were thrown down, but Judas, the son of Matthias, especially, waged war with his men.

(2 Maccabees 15:26) 
When the Jews heard of Judas's fame and what he had done, fearing him, they remained in his hands, as they were.

(2 Maccabees 15:27) 
And they praised the Lord, who had given them victory.

(Matthew 1:1) 
This is the book of the ancestry of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, son of Abraham.

(Matthew 1:2) 
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers:

(Matthew 1:3) 
Judah was the father of Phares and Zaram. Their mother was Thamar. Phares was the father of Esrom. Esrom was the father of Aram:

(Matthew 1:4) 
Aram was the father of Aminadab. Aminadab was the father of Naasson. Naasson was the father of Salmon:

(Matthew 1:5) 
Salmon was the father of Booz, whose mother was Rahab. Booz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth. Obed was the father of Jesse:

(Matthew 1:6) 
Jesse was the father of King David. King David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah:

(Matthew 1:7) 
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa:

(Matthew 1:8) 
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah:

(Matthew 1:9) 
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah:

(Matthew 1:10) 
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amos. Amos was the father of Josiah:

(Matthew 1:11) 
Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.

(Matthew 1:12) 
After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel:

(Matthew 1:13) 
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor:

(Matthew 1:14) 
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achim. Achim was the father of Eliud:

(Matthew 1:15) 
Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob:

(Matthew 1:16) 
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ.

(Matthew 1:17) 
Thus there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Christ.

(Matthew 1:18) 
This is how Jesus Christ was born. His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they were married, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.

(Matthew 1:19) 
Because Joseph was a righteous man and did not want to publicly disgrace her, he decided to quietly divorce her.

(Matthew 1:20) 
But as he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

(Matthew 1:21) 
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

(Matthew 1:22) 
All of this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:

(Matthew 1:23) 
“Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,” which means, “God with us.”

(Matthew 1:24) 
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.

(Matthew 1:25) 
But he did not know her as a husband until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.

(Matthew 2:1) 
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,

(Matthew 2:2) 
saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”

(Matthew 2:3) 
King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

(Matthew 2:4) 
He assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

(Matthew 2:5) 
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea.” For so it is written by the prophet:

(Matthew 2:6) 
“And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”

(Matthew 2:7) 
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the time when the star had appeared.

(Matthew 2:8) 
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”

(Matthew 2:9) 
When they had heard the king, they went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was.

(Matthew 2:10) 
When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.

(Matthew 2:11) 
And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

(Matthew 2:12) 
And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.

(Matthew 2:13) 
Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy him.”

(Matthew 2:14) 
So he got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt,

(Matthew 2:15) 
and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”

(Matthew 2:16) 
Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.

(Matthew 2:17) 
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

(Matthew 2:18) 
“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”

(Matthew 2:19) 
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

(Matthew 2:20) 
saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”

(Matthew 2:21) 
So he got up, took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

(Matthew 2:22) 
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,

(Matthew 2:23) 
and came and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.

(Matthew 3:1) 
At that time, John the Baptist came, preaching in the desert of Judea,

(Matthew 3:2) 
and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"

(Matthew 3:3) 
For this is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the desert, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.'

(Matthew 3:4) 
Now John himself wore a garment made of camel's hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.

(Matthew 3:5) 
Then Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan River went out to him,

(Matthew 3:6) 
and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

(Matthew 3:7) 
But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

(Matthew 3:8) 
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance.

(Matthew 3:9) 
And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.

(Matthew 3:10) 
And now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Matthew 3:11) 
I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

(Matthew 3:12) 
His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."

(Matthew 3:13) 
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.

(Matthew 3:14) 
But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?"

(Matthew 3:15) 
But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him.

(Matthew 3:16) 
When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.

(Matthew 3:17) 
And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

(Matthew 4:1) 
Then the Holy Spirit sent Jesus to the desert to be tested by the devil.

(Matthew 4:2) 
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, He became hungry.

(Matthew 4:3) 
The tempter then came to Him, and said, "If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."

(Matthew 4:4) 
But Jesus responded: "The Scriptures say, 'Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

(Matthew 4:5) 
Then the devil took Him to the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,

(Matthew 4:6) 
saying, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down, because it is written, 'He will command His angels concerning you.' And 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.'

(Matthew 4:7) 
Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'

(Matthew 4:8) 
Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,

(Matthew 4:9) 
and said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You fall down and worship me."

(Matthew 4:10) 
Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.'

(Matthew 4:11) 
Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.

(Matthew 4:12) 
But when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee.

(Matthew 4:13) 
And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,

(Matthew 4:14) 
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying:

(Matthew 4:15) 
'The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,

(Matthew 4:16) 
the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned.'

(Matthew 4:17) 
From that time, Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

(Matthew 4:18) 
And walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

(Matthew 4:19) 
And He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."

(Matthew 4:20) 
And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

(Matthew 4:21) 
And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.

(Matthew 4:22) 
And immediately they left the nets and their father, and followed Him.

(Matthew 4:23) 
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.

(Matthew 4:24) 
Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.

(Matthew 4:25) 
And great multitudes followed Him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.

(Matthew 5:1) 
Seeing the crowds, He went up onto the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples gathered around Him.

(Matthew 5:2) 
Opening His mouth, He taught them, saying:

(Matthew 5:3) 
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:4) 
Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the earth.

(Matthew 5:5) 
Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted.

(Matthew 5:6) 
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall have their fill.

(Matthew 5:7) 
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

(Matthew 5:8) 
Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God.

(Matthew 5:9) 
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

(Matthew 5:10) 
Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice's sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:11) 
Blessed are you when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for My sake:

(Matthew 5:12) 
Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

(Matthew 5:13) 
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is good for nothing anymore but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.

(Matthew 5:14) 
You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.

(Matthew 5:15) 
Neither do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but upon a lampstand, that it may shine to all who are in the house.

(Matthew 5:16) 
So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 5:17) 
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.

(Matthew 5:18) 
For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law, till all things are accomplished.

(Matthew 5:19) 
Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he that shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:20) 
For I say unto you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 5:21) 
You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

(Matthew 5:22) 
But I say to you, that whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

(Matthew 5:23) 
If therefore you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you:

(Matthew 5:24) 
leave your gift before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to your brother; and then coming you shall offer your gift.

(Matthew 5:25) 
Be at agreement with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.

(Matthew 5:26) 
Amen I say to you, you shall not go out from thence, till you repay the last farthing.

(Matthew 5:27) 
You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery.

(Matthew 5:28) 
But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

(Matthew 5:29) 
And if thy right eye scandalizes thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

(Matthew 5:30) 
And if thy right hand scandalizes thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body should go into hell.

(Matthew 5:31) 
And it hath been said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.

(Matthew 5:32) 
But I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her who is put away, commits adultery.

(Matthew 5:33) 
Again you have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not forswear thyself; but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.

(Matthew 5:34) 
But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God:

(Matthew 5:35) 
nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet: nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king:

(Matthew 5:36) 
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.

(Matthew 5:37) 
But let your speech be, Yes, yes: No, no: and that which is over and above these, is of evil.

(Matthew 5:38) 
You have heard that it hath been said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

(Matthew 5:39) 
But I say to you not to resist evil: but if anyone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other:

(Matthew 5:40) 
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also:

(Matthew 5:41) 
And whosoever shall force thee to go one mile, go with him two.

(Matthew 5:42) 
Give to him that asks of thee; and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.

(Matthew 5:43) 
You have heard that it hath been said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy.

(Matthew 5:44) 
But I say to you, Love your enemies: do good to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:

(Matthew 5:45) 
That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: who makes his sun to rise upon the good and the bad, and rains upon the just and the unjust.

(Matthew 5:46) 
For if you love those who love you, what reward shall you have? Do not even the publicans do the same?

(Matthew 5:47) 
And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? Do not also the heathens do the same?

(Matthew 5:48) 
Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect.

(Matthew 6:1) 
Be careful not to display your piety merely to be seen by others. Otherwise, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.

(Matthew 6:2) 
So when you give alms, do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:3) 
But when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing,

(Matthew 6:4) 
so that your alms may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:5) 
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:6) 
But when you pray, go into your room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:7) 
And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.

(Matthew 6:8) 
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

(Matthew 6:9) 
Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

(Matthew 6:10) 
“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

(Matthew 6:11) 
“Give us this day our daily bread,

(Matthew 6:12) 
“And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

(Matthew 6:13) 
“And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”

(Matthew 6:14) 
For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,

(Matthew 6:15) 
but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

(Matthew 6:16) 
“And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

(Matthew 6:17) 
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,

(Matthew 6:18) 
that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father, who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

(Matthew 6:19) 
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,

(Matthew 6:20) 
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

(Matthew 6:21) 
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

(Matthew 6:22) 
“The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light,

(Matthew 6:23) 
but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

(Matthew 6:24) 
“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

(Matthew 6:25) 
“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

(Matthew 6:26) 
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?

(Matthew 6:27) 
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?

(Matthew 6:28) 
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,

(Matthew 6:29) 
yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

(Matthew 6:30) 
But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

(Matthew 6:31) 
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

(Matthew 6:32) 
For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.

(Matthew 6:33) 
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

(Matthew 6:34) 
“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

(Matthew 7:1) 
Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.

(Matthew 7:2) 
Because in the way you judge, you will be judged. And in the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

(Matthew 7:3) 
And why do you see a splinter in your brother's eye, but the beam in your own eye do you not see?

(Matthew 7:4) 
Or how do you say to your brother, ‘Let me cast the splinter out of your eye,’ and look, there is a beam in your own eye?

(Matthew 7:5) 
Hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see how to cast the splinter out of your brother's eye.

(Matthew 7:6) 
Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest perhaps they trample them with their feet, and turning, they tear you to pieces.

(Matthew 7:7) 
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

(Matthew 7:8) 
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened.

(Matthew 7:9) 
Or what man is there among you, whom if his son asks for bread, will he hand him a stone?

(Matthew 7:10) 
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?

(Matthew 7:11) 
If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?

(Matthew 7:12) 
Therefore, all things that you want men to do to you, do also to them. For this is the Law and the Prophets.

(Matthew 7:13) 
Enter through the narrow gate; because wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.

(Matthew 7:14) 
How narrow is the gate, and constricted is the way that leads to life; and few are those who find it!

(Matthew 7:15) 
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.

(Matthew 7:16) 
By their fruits you will know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?

(Matthew 7:17) 
So every good tree brings forth good fruits, and a bad tree brings forth bad fruits.

(Matthew 7:18) 
A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruits, nor can a bad tree bring forth good fruits.

(Matthew 7:19) 
Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Matthew 7:20) 
Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.

(Matthew 7:21) 
Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 7:22) 
Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’

(Matthew 7:23) 
And then I will confess to them: ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you who work iniquity.’

(Matthew 7:24) 
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be likened to a wise man who built his house upon a rock.

(Matthew 7:25) 
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not fall, because it was founded upon a rock.

(Matthew 7:26) 
And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.

(Matthew 7:27) 
And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was its ruin.

(Matthew 7:28) 
And it happened that when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.

(Matthew 7:29) 
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.

(Matthew 8:1) 
When Jesus came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.

(Matthew 8:2) 
And behold, a leper came and worshipped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”

(Matthew 8:3) 
And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.”

(Matthew 8:4) 
And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”

(Matthew 8:5) 
When He had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, beseeching Him,

(Matthew 8:6) 
and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”

(Matthew 8:7) 
And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

(Matthew 8:8) 
The centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.

(Matthew 8:9) 
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

(Matthew 8:10) 
When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed Him, “Truly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith in anyone in Israel.

(Matthew 8:11) 
I say to you that many will come from the east and west and recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,

(Matthew 8:12) 
but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

(Matthew 8:13) 
And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed that very hour.

(Matthew 8:14) 
When Jesus had entered Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.

(Matthew 8:15) 
He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and served Him.

(Matthew 8:16) 
When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.

(Matthew 8:17) 
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.”

(Matthew 8:18) 
Now when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to go over to the other side.

(Matthew 8:19) 
And a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”

(Matthew 8:20) 
And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”

(Matthew 8:21) 
And another of the disciples said to Him, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”

(Matthew 8:22) 
But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

(Matthew 8:23) 
And when He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.

(Matthew 8:24) 
And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered with waves, but He was sleeping.

(Matthew 8:25) 
And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”

(Matthew 8:26) 
And He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.

(Matthew 8:27) 
And the men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”

(Matthew 8:28) 
And when He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him as they came out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.

(Matthew 8:29) 
And they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”

(Matthew 8:30) 
Now some distance from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.

(Matthew 8:31) 
And the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.”

(Matthew 8:32) 
And He said to them, “Go!” And when they came out, they went into the swine, and behold, the whole herd of swine rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.

(Matthew 8:33) 
Then the herdsmen fled, and they went away to the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.

(Matthew 8:34) 
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.

(Matthew 9:1) 
Then, Jesus got into a boat and crossed the sea to return to his own city.

(Matthew 9:2) 
And as he arrived, some people brought to him a paralytic, who was lying on a bed.

(Matthew 9:3) 
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Have courage, my son; your sins are forgiven.”

(Matthew 9:4) 
Some of the scribes, however, thought to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.”

(Matthew 9:5) 
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you consider evil things in your hearts?

(Matthew 9:6) 
Is it easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?

(Matthew 9:7) 
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—then Jesus said to the paralytic, “Rise, take your bed, and go home.”

(Matthew 9:8) 
And immediately he rose and went home.

(Matthew 9:9) 
Seeing this, the crowds were struck with fear and glorified God, who had given such power to men.

(Matthew 9:10) 
As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me.” And Matthew rose and followed him.

(Matthew 9:11) 
While Jesus was at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.

(Matthew 9:12) 
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

(Matthew 9:13) 
But when Jesus heard this, he said, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor, but those who are sick.

(Matthew 9:14) 
But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

(Matthew 9:15) 
Then John's disciples came to him, asking, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”

(Matthew 9:16) 
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away, and then they will fast.

(Matthew 9:17) 
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse.

(Matthew 9:18) 
Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, the wine spills out, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”

(Matthew 9:19) 
While he was saying these things to them, a certain ruler came and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come, put your hand on her, and she will live.”

(Matthew 9:20) 
Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.

(Matthew 9:21) 
Suddenly, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his garment.

(Matthew 9:22) 
For she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.”

(Matthew 9:23) 
Jesus turned, and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter; your faith has saved you.” And from that moment, the woman was made well.

(Matthew 9:24) 
When Jesus arrived at the ruler’s house, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion.

(Matthew 9:25) 
He said, “Get out! The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they laughed at him.

(Matthew 9:26) 
But when the crowd was put out, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.

(Matthew 9:27) 
And the news of this spread throughout that whole region.

(Matthew 9:28) 
As Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”

(Matthew 9:29) 
When he entered the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?”

(Matthew 9:30) 
They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith, let it be done for you.”

(Matthew 9:31) 
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.”

(Matthew 9:32) 
But they went out and spread the news of him throughout that whole region.

(Matthew 9:33) 
After they went out, behold, they brought to him a mute man possessed by a demon.

(Matthew 9:34) 
And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”

(Matthew 9:35) 
But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of demons he casts out demons.”

(Matthew 9:36) 
Jesus traveled throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.

(Matthew 9:37) 
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

(Matthew 9:38) 
Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.

(Matthew 9:39) 
Therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”

(Matthew 10:1) 
And when He had called His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every sickness and every disease.

(Matthew 10:2) 
And these are the names of the twelve Apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,

(Matthew 10:3) 
Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,

(Matthew 10:4) 
Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

(Matthew 10:5) 
These twelve Jesus sent, commanding them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.

(Matthew 10:6) 
But go instead to the sheep that have gone astray from the house of Israel.

(Matthew 10:7) 
And as you go, preach, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’

(Matthew 10:8) 
Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: you have received freely, give freely.

(Matthew 10:9) 
Do not acquire gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses:

(Matthew 10:10) 
Nor a bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.

(Matthew 10:11) 
And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy: and stay there until you leave.

(Matthew 10:12) 
And entering into the house, greet it, saying: ‘Peace to this house.’

(Matthew 10:13) 
And if the house is worthy, your peace will come upon it: but if it is not worthy, your peace will return to you.

(Matthew 10:14) 
And whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words: leaving that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.

(Matthew 10:15) 
Amen I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

(Matthew 10:16) 
Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be prudent as serpents, and simple as doves.

(Matthew 10:17) 
But beware of men. For they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you:

(Matthew 10:18) 
And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

(Matthew 10:19) 
But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak: for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say:

(Matthew 10:20) 
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

(Matthew 10:21) 
And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and children will rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death:

(Matthew 10:22) 
And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake: but he who perseveres until the end, he will be saved.

(Matthew 10:23) 
And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.

(Matthew 10:24) 
The disciple is not above his master, nor is the servant above his lord.

(Matthew 10:25) 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?

(Matthew 10:26) 
Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed: and nothing secret that will not be known.

(Matthew 10:27) 
What I say to you in the dark, speak in the light: and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops.

(Matthew 10:28) 
And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul: but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

(Matthew 10:29) 
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And not one of them will fall on the ground without your Father.

(Matthew 10:30) 
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

(Matthew 10:31) 
Therefore do not be afraid: you are more valuable than many sparrows.

(Matthew 10:32) 
Therefore everyone who acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 10:33) 
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.

(Matthew 10:34) 
Do not think that I came to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

(Matthew 10:35) 
For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:

(Matthew 10:36) 
And a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.

(Matthew 10:37) 
He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

(Matthew 10:38) 
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.

(Matthew 10:39) 
He who finds his life will lose it: and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.

(Matthew 10:40) 
He who receives you receives Me: and he who receives Me receives Him Who sent Me.

(Matthew 10:41) 
He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward: and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.

(Matthew 10:42) 
And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple: Amen I say to you, he will not lose his reward.

(Matthew 11:1) 
After Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.

(Matthew 11:2) 
When John heard in prison about the things that Christ was doing, he sent two of his disciples,

(Matthew 11:3) 
asking Him, "Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for another?"

(Matthew 11:4) 
Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:

(Matthew 11:5) 
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are evangelized."

(Matthew 11:6) 
Blessed is the one who is not offended by Me."

(Matthew 11:7) 
As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

(Matthew 11:8) 
Or what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes are in royal palaces.

(Matthew 11:9) 
Or what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

(Matthew 11:10) 
This is the one about whom it is written: ‘I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way before You.’

(Matthew 11:11) 
Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

(Matthew 11:12) 
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people are taking it by force.

(Matthew 11:13) 
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

(Matthew 11:14) 
And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.

(Matthew 11:15) 
He who has ears, let him hear.

(Matthew 11:16) 
To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions:

(Matthew 11:17) 
‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.’

(Matthew 11:18) 
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’

(Matthew 11:19) 
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved right by her deeds."

(Matthew 11:20) 
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent:

(Matthew 11:21) 
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

(Matthew 11:22) 
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.

(Matthew 11:23) 
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.

(Matthew 11:24) 
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."

(Matthew 11:25) 
At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of the universe and the earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and revealed them to little children.

(Matthew 11:26) 
Yes, Father, for this is what You were pleased to do.

(Matthew 11:27) 
All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him.

(Matthew 11:28) 
"Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

(Matthew 11:29) 
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

(Matthew 11:30) 
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."

(Matthew 12:1) 
At that time, Jesus walked through a field of grain on a Sabbath. His disciples, famished, began to pluck the heads of grain and eat them.

(Matthew 12:2) 
But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what isn't lawful to do on the Sabbath."

(Matthew 12:3) 
But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:

(Matthew 12:4) 
How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?

(Matthew 12:5) 
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath, the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath, and are without guilt?

(Matthew 12:6) 
But I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.

(Matthew 12:7) 
If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would never have condemned the innocent.

(Matthew 12:8) 
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.

(Matthew 12:9) 
And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.

(Matthew 12:10) 
And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they questioned Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" This was to accuse Him.

(Matthew 12:11) 
But He said to them, "Who among you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?

(Matthew 12:12) 
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

(Matthew 12:13) 
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.

(Matthew 12:14) 
But the Pharisees went out and made a plan against Him, on how to destroy Him.

(Matthew 12:15) 
Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all.

(Matthew 12:16) 
And He commanded them not to make Him known.

(Matthew 12:17) 
This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:

(Matthew 12:18) 
"Behold, My servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.

(Matthew 12:19) 
He will not quarrel nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

(Matthew 12:20) 
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not quench, until He brings justice to victory.

(Matthew 12:21) 
And in His name the Gentiles will hope."

(Matthew 12:22) 
Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that the man spoke and saw.

(Matthew 12:23) 
And all the crowds were amazed, and were saying, "Could this be the Son of David?"

(Matthew 12:24) 
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."

(Matthew 12:25) 
But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

(Matthew 12:26) 
And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?

(Matthew 12:27) 
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

(Matthew 12:28) 
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

(Matthew 12:29) 
Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.

(Matthew 12:30) 
He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

(Matthew 12:31) 
Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

(Matthew 12:32) 
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

(Matthew 12:33) 
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For the tree is known by its fruit.

(Matthew 12:34) 
You brood of vipers, how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

(Matthew 12:35) 
The good man brings good things out of his good treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil treasure.

(Matthew 12:36) 
I tell you, that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account of it in the day of judgment.

(Matthew 12:37) 
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.

(Matthew 12:38) 
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."

(Matthew 12:39) 
He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

(Matthew 12:40) 
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.

(Matthew 12:41) 
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.

(Matthew 12:42) 
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.

(Matthew 12:43) 
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, it passes through arid places, seeking rest, but finds none.

(Matthew 12:44) 
Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

(Matthew 12:45) 
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.

(Matthew 12:46) 
While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him.

(Matthew 12:47) 
Then someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to You."

(Matthew 12:48) 
But He answered the one who told Him, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?"

(Matthew 12:49) 
And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold My mother and My brothers!

(Matthew 12:50) 
For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven is My brother and sister and mother."

(Matthew 13:1) 
On that very day, Jesus went outside of the house and sat near the Sea of Galilee.

(Matthew 13:2) 
And many crowds came together to meet Him. He got into a boat and sat, and the entire crowd stood on the shore.

(Matthew 13:3) 
And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow seeds."

(Matthew 13:4) 
And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them.

(Matthew 13:5) 
Other seeds fell on rocky places where there wasn't much soil. They quickly sprang up because they didn't have much depth of soil.

(Matthew 13:6) 
But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they didn't have any roots, they withered.

(Matthew 13:7) 
Other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.

(Matthew 13:8) 
But others fell on good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.

(Matthew 13:9) 
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

(Matthew 13:10) 
And the disciples, approaching Him, said to Him: "Why do You speak to them in parables?"

(Matthew 13:11) 
He answered and said to them: "Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but it has not been given to them.

(Matthew 13:12) 
For to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance. But from him who does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away.

(Matthew 13:13) 
Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

(Matthew 13:14) 
And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in them, saying: 'You will hear and hear, but you will not understand. And seeing, you will see, but you will not perceive.'

(Matthew 13:15) 
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'

(Matthew 13:16) 
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.

(Matthew 13:17) 
For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.

(Matthew 13:18) 
Therefore, hear the parable of the sower.

(Matthew 13:19) 
Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the road.

(Matthew 13:20) 
And the one sown on the rocky places, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.

(Matthew 13:21) 
Yet he has no root in himself, but is temporary. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he immediately falls away.

(Matthew 13:22) 
The one sown among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word. But the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

(Matthew 13:23) 
But the one sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, and he yields fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.

(Matthew 13:24) 
Another parable He put before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

(Matthew 13:25) 
But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.

(Matthew 13:26) 
When the blade came up and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.

(Matthew 13:27) 
And the servants of the master of the house came to him and said, 'Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'

(Matthew 13:28) 
He said to them: 'An enemy has done this.' And the servants said to him: 'Do you want us to go and gather them?'

(Matthew 13:29) 
He said: 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat with them.'

(Matthew 13:30) 
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: 'First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'

(Matthew 13:31) 
He put another parable before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.

(Matthew 13:32) 
It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown, it is the largest of the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and make nests in its branches.

(Matthew 13:33) 
He spoke another parable to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened."

(Matthew 13:34) 
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without parables,

(Matthew 13:35) 
so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.'

(Matthew 13:36) 
Then, having dismissed the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying: "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field."

(Matthew 13:37) 
He answered and said to them: "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.

(Matthew 13:38) 
The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom, and the weeds are the children of the evil one.

(Matthew 13:39) 
And the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.

(Matthew 13:40) 
So just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.

(Matthew 13:41) 
The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that cause sin and those who do evil,

(Matthew 13:42) 
and will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 13:43) 
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has an ear, let him hear.

(Matthew 13:44) 
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. And for joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

(Matthew 13:45) 
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls,

(Matthew 13:46) 
and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.

(Matthew 13:47) 
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, from which fish of every kind were gathered.

(Matthew 13:48) 
When it was full, they drew it up on the shore, and they sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but threw away the bad ones.

(Matthew 13:49) 
So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous,

(Matthew 13:50) 
and will throw them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 13:51) 
Have you understood all these things?" They said to Him, "Yes."

(Matthew 13:52) 
And He said to them: "Therefore, every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings out of his treasure things new and old."

(Matthew 13:53) 
And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.

(Matthew 13:54) 
And coming into his hometown, He taught them in their synagogues, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?

(Matthew 13:55) 
Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?

(Matthew 13:56) 
And are not His sisters all with us?" Where did this man get all these things?"

(Matthew 13:57) 
And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."

(Matthew 13:58) 
And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

(Matthew 14:1) 
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,

(Matthew 14:2) 
and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous works are happening through him.”

(Matthew 14:3) 
For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

(Matthew 14:4) 
John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”

(Matthew 14:5) 
And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because they considered John a prophet.

(Matthew 14:6) 
When Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and she pleased Herod.

(Matthew 14:7) 
So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.

(Matthew 14:8) 
Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”

(Matthew 14:9) 
The king was distressed, but because of his oath and his guests, he commanded it to be given.

(Matthew 14:10) 
He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.

(Matthew 14:11) 
His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.

(Matthew 14:12) 
John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it, and then they went and told Jesus.

(Matthew 14:13) 
When Jesus heard this, He withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the towns.

(Matthew 14:14) 
As He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them and healed their sick.

(Matthew 14:15) 
When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”

(Matthew 14:16) 
But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”

(Matthew 14:17) 
They replied, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”

(Matthew 14:18) 
And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”

(Matthew 14:19) 
Then He commanded the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the universe, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

(Matthew 14:20) 
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over, twelve full baskets of the fragments.

(Matthew 14:21) 
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.

(Matthew 14:22) 
Immediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.

(Matthew 14:23) 
And after He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.

(Matthew 14:24) 
But the boat was already a long way from the land, battered by the waves, for the wind was against them.

(Matthew 14:25) 
And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.

(Matthew 14:26) 
And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.

(Matthew 14:27) 
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take courage; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

(Matthew 14:28) 
Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”

(Matthew 14:29) 
He said, “Come.” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

(Matthew 14:30) 
But when he saw the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”

(Matthew 14:31) 
Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of him, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

(Matthew 14:32) 
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

(Matthew 14:33) 
And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”

(Matthew 14:34) 
When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.

(Matthew 14:35) 
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that region and brought to Him all the sick.

(Matthew 14:36) 
And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched it were healed.

(Matthew 15:1) 
At that time, the scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and they were saying:

(Matthew 15:2) 
“Why do your disciples break the tradition of our elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat bread.”

(Matthew 15:3) 
Jesus then answered them, and said: “And why do you yourselves break God’s command because of your tradition?

(Matthew 15:4) 
For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever curses father or mother, let him die.’”

(Matthew 15:5) 
“But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever gift I have from you will benefit you,”

(Matthew 15:6) 
and does not honor his father or his mother,’ you have made void the command of God because of your tradition.

(Matthew 15:7) 
Hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied rightly about you, when he said:

(Matthew 15:8) 
‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

(Matthew 15:9) 
And in vain they worship me, teaching doctrines and commands of men.’

(Matthew 15:10) 
And calling the crowds to him, he said to them: “Hear and understand.

(Matthew 15:11) 
It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a man.”

(Matthew 15:12) 
Then, approaching him, his disciples said to him: “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”

(Matthew 15:13) 
But he answered them, and said: “Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

(Matthew 15:14) 
Leave them be: they are blind, and are leaders of the blind. But if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”

(Matthew 15:15) 
And Peter answered, and said to him: “Explain to us this parable.”

(Matthew 15:16) 
But Jesus said: “Are you also still without understanding?

(Matthew 15:17) 
Do you not understand that everything that enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is eliminated in the privy?

(Matthew 15:18) 
But the things that proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and these defile a man.

(Matthew 15:19) 
For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.

(Matthew 15:20) 
These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”

(Matthew 15:21) 
And Jesus, going out from there, withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

(Matthew 15:22) 
And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and was crying out, saying to him: “Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David! My daughter is severely vexed by a demon.”

(Matthew 15:23) 
But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples, approaching him, were begging him, saying: “Send her away, because she cries out after us.”

(Matthew 15:24) 
He answered, and said: “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

(Matthew 15:25) 
But she came and worshiped him, saying: “Lord, help me.”

(Matthew 15:26) 
He answered, and said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.”

(Matthew 15:27) 
But she said: “Yes, Lord; for even the puppies eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

(Matthew 15:28) 
Then Jesus answered, and said to her: “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.

(Matthew 15:29) 
And Jesus, having passed on from there, came near the sea of Galilee, and going up into a mountain, was sitting there.

(Matthew 15:30) 
And many crowds came to him, bringing with them the mute, the blind, the lame, the infirm, and many others. And they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them.

(Matthew 15:31) 
So that the crowds were astonished, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.

(Matthew 15:32) 
Then Jesus, calling his disciples, said: “I have compassion on the crowds, because they have been with me now for three days, and they have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”

(Matthew 15:33) 
And his disciples said to him: “Where do we get so many loaves in the wilderness so that we can satisfy such a large crowd?”

(Matthew 15:34) 
And Jesus said to them: “How many loaves do you have?” And they said: “Seven, and a few small fishes.”

(Matthew 15:35) 
And he commanded the crowds to recline on the ground.

(Matthew 15:36) 
And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

(Matthew 15:37) 
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what remained, seven baskets full of fragments.

(Matthew 15:38) 
Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.

(Matthew 15:39) 
And having dismissed the crowds, he went into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.

(Matthew 16:1) 
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi, and He asked His disciples, “What do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”

(Matthew 16:2) 
And they said: “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”

(Matthew 16:3) 
Jesus said to them, “But you, who do you say that I am?”

(Matthew 16:4) 
Then Simon Peter answered, saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

(Matthew 16:5) 
Then Jesus answered, saying to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father Who is in the universe.

(Matthew 16:6) 
And I say to you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.

(Matthew 16:7) 
And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the sky. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in the sky. And whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in the sky.”

(Matthew 16:8) 
Then He commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.

(Matthew 16:9) 
From that time on, Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and scribes and chief priests, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.

(Matthew 16:10) 
And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This shall never happen to You!”

(Matthew 16:11) 
But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”

(Matthew 16:12) 
Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.

(Matthew 16:13) 
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.

(Matthew 16:14) 
For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?

(Matthew 16:15) 
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each one according to his works.

(Matthew 16:16) 
Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”

(Matthew 17:1) 
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, and James, and his brother John, and led them up a high mountain, just the three of them.

(Matthew 17:2) 
And he was transfigured before their eyes. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as snow.

(Matthew 17:3) 
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.

(Matthew 17:4) 
Then Peter responded to Jesus and said: “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

(Matthew 17:5) 
As he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud, saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”

(Matthew 17:6) 
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.

(Matthew 17:7) 
But Jesus came and touched them, and said: “Get up, and do not be afraid.”

(Matthew 17:8) 
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus alone.

(Matthew 17:9) 
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man rises from the dead.”

(Matthew 17:10) 
And his disciples asked him, saying: “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

(Matthew 17:11) 
And answering, he said to them: “Elijah will come, and he will restore all things.”

(Matthew 17:12) 
“But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”

(Matthew 17:13) 
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.

(Matthew 17:14) 
And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, kneeling before him.

(Matthew 17:15) 
He said: “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is epileptic and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.

(Matthew 17:16) 
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”

(Matthew 17:17) 
Then Jesus answered and said: “O faithless and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him here to me.”

(Matthew 17:18) 
And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and the boy was cured from that hour.

(Matthew 17:19) 
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: “Why could we not cast it out?”

(Matthew 17:20) 
Jesus said to them: “Because of your lack of faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”

(Matthew 17:21) 
“But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.”

(Matthew 17:22) 
While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them: “The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the hands of men.

(Matthew 17:23) 
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.” And they were exceedingly sorrowful.

(Matthew 17:24) 
When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said: “Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma tax?”

(Matthew 17:25) 
He said: “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or tribute? From their sons or from strangers?”

(Matthew 17:26) 
He said: “From strangers.” Jesus said to him: “Therefore, the sons are free.”

(Matthew 17:27) 
“However, so that we do not offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a stater. Give that for me and for you.”

(Matthew 18:1) 
At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of the sky?”

(Matthew 18:2) 
Jesus then called a little child, and made him stand in their midst,

(Matthew 18:3) 
and said: “I assure you: unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of the sky.

(Matthew 18:4) 
Whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of the sky.

(Matthew 18:5) 
And whoever welcomes one such child in My name welcomes Me.

(Matthew 18:6) 
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea.

(Matthew 18:7) 
Woe to the world because of scandals! For it is necessary that scandals come, but woe to the man by whom the scandal comes!

(Matthew 18:8) 
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

(Matthew 18:9) 
And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire.

(Matthew 18:10) 
See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in the sky always behold the face of My Father who is in the sky.

(Matthew 18:11) 
For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.

(Matthew 18:12) 
What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?

(Matthew 18:13) 
And if he finds it, I assure you that he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

(Matthew 18:14) 
Therefore, it is not the will of your Father who is in the sky that one of these little ones should perish.

(Matthew 18:15) 
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.

(Matthew 18:16) 
But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed.

(Matthew 18:17) 
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the Church. And if he refuses to listen even to the Church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

(Matthew 18:18) 
I assure you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in the sky, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in the sky.

(Matthew 18:19) 
Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by My Father who is in the sky.

(Matthew 18:20) 
For where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them.

(Matthew 18:21) 
Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”

(Matthew 18:22) 
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.

(Matthew 18:23) 
For this reason, the kingdom of the sky is compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.

(Matthew 18:24) 
When he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.

(Matthew 18:25) 
And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.

(Matthew 18:26) 
So the servant fell down and implored him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’

(Matthew 18:27) 
And out of pity for the servant, the master released him and forgave him the debt.

(Matthew 18:28) 
But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And seizing him, he choked him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’

(Matthew 18:29) 
So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’

(Matthew 18:30) 
But he was unwilling and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.

(Matthew 18:31) 
When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place.

(Matthew 18:32) 
Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.

(Matthew 18:33) 
Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’

(Matthew 18:34) 
And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt.

(Matthew 18:35) 
So also My heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.

(Matthew 19:1) 
After Jesus had finished saying these things, He left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.

(Matthew 19:2) 
Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

(Matthew 19:3) 
The Pharisees came to Him and tried to test Him, asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”

(Matthew 19:4) 
He answered and said to them, “Haven’t you read that the One who made mankind in the beginning made them male and female?”

(Matthew 19:5) 
And He said, ‘For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’

(Matthew 19:6) 
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no man separate.”

(Matthew 19:7) 
They said to Him, “Then why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to dismiss her?”

(Matthew 19:8) 
He said to them, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts, but it was not so from the beginning.

(Matthew 19:9) 
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”

(Matthew 19:10) 
His disciples said to Him, “If the case of a man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.”

(Matthew 19:11) 
But He said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but those to whom it has been given.

(Matthew 19:12) 
For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone who can receive this, receive it.”

(Matthew 19:13) 
Then children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them,

(Matthew 19:14) 
But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”

(Matthew 19:15) 
And after He laid hands on them, He departed from there.

(Matthew 19:16) 
And behold, one came to Him and said, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life?”

(Matthew 19:17) 
But He said to him, “Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

(Matthew 19:18) 
He said to Him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,

(Matthew 19:19) 
honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Matthew 19:20) 
The young man said to Him, “All these things I have kept. What am I still lacking?”

(Matthew 19:21) 
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.”

(Matthew 19:22) 
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.

(Matthew 19:23) 
And Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.

(Matthew 19:24) 
Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”

(Matthew 19:25) 
When His disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”

(Matthew 19:26) 
But Jesus looked at them and said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

(Matthew 19:27) 
Then Peter responded and said to Him, “Behold, we have forsaken everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?”

(Matthew 19:28) 
And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

(Matthew 19:29) 
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name’s sake will receive many times more, and will inherit eternal life.

(Matthew 19:30) 
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

(Matthew 20:1) 
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning looking to hire workers for his vineyard.

(Matthew 20:2) 
After he agreed to pay the workers a denarius for a day's work, he sent them to his vineyard.

(Matthew 20:3) 
He went out again at about the third hour of the day and found others standing idle in the marketplace,

(Matthew 20:4) 
and said to them, 'Go into my vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is fair.' And so they went.

(Matthew 20:5) 
He went out again at about the sixth and ninth hours of the day, and did the same.

(Matthew 20:6) 
And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found still others standing there, and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?'

(Matthew 20:7) 
They said to him, 'Because nobody hired us.' He said to them, 'Go into my vineyard too.'

(Matthew 20:8) 
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and going to the first.'

(Matthew 20:9) 
So when those hired at the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.

(Matthew 20:10) 
When the first ones came, they thought they would receive more, but they too received a denarius.

(Matthew 20:11) 
When they received it, they began to complain about the owner of the vineyard,

(Matthew 20:12) 
saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and yet you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.'

(Matthew 20:13) 
But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

(Matthew 20:14) 
Take what belongs to you and go. I want to give to this last one the same as I gave to you.

(Matthew 20:15) 
Am I not allowed to do what I want with my own things? Or are you envious because I am generous?'

(Matthew 20:16) 
In this way the last will be first, and the first will be last. Many are called, but few are chosen.

(Matthew 20:17) 
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside in private and said to them,

(Matthew 20:18) 
“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,

(Matthew 20:19) 
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and on the third day he will be raised.”

(Matthew 20:20) 
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.

(Matthew 20:21) 
He said to her, “What do you want?” She replied, “Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”

(Matthew 20:22) 
But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am going to drink?”

(Matthew 20:23) 
They said to him, “We are able.” Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right and left is not mine to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”

(Matthew 20:24) 
When the other ten disciples heard about this, they became indignant with the two brothers.

(Matthew 20:25) 
But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.

(Matthew 20:26) 
It shall not be this way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,

(Matthew 20:27) 
and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave,

(Matthew 20:28) 
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

(Matthew 20:29) 
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.

(Matthew 20:30) 
And two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by. They cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

(Matthew 20:31) 
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

(Matthew 20:32) 
Jesus stopped and called them. He asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”

(Matthew 20:33) 
They said to him, “Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.”

(Matthew 20:34) 
Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.

(Matthew 21:1) 
When they drew near to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,

(Matthew 21:2) 
saying to them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.”

(Matthew 21:3) 
If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord has need of them, and immediately he will let them go.”

(Matthew 21:4) 
All this happened so that what was spoken by the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,

(Matthew 21:5) 
“Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, and a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”

(Matthew 21:6) 
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.

(Matthew 21:7) 
They brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments on them, and He sat on them.

(Matthew 21:8) 
Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.

(Matthew 21:9) 
The crowds, who went before Him and who followed Him, cried out, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”

(Matthew 21:10) 
And when He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”

(Matthew 21:11) 
The crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.”

(Matthew 21:12) 
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.

(Matthew 21:13) 
He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers.”

(Matthew 21:14) 
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.

(Matthew 21:15) 
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant.

(Matthew 21:16) 
And they said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise’?”

(Matthew 21:17) 
And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.

(Matthew 21:18) 
Now in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.

(Matthew 21:19) 
Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went to it and found nothing on it except leaves, and He said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again.” And immediately the fig tree withered.

(Matthew 21:20) 
Seeing this, the disciples were amazed, and said, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”

(Matthew 21:21) 
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.

(Matthew 21:22) 
And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

(Matthew 21:23) 
And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, “By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”

(Matthew 21:24) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “I will also ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.

(Matthew 21:25) 
The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?” They reasoned with themselves, saying,

(Matthew 21:26) 
“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.”

(Matthew 21:27) 
So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Matthew 21:28) 
“But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’

(Matthew 21:29) 
“And he answered and said, ‘I will not’; but afterward he regretted it and went.

(Matthew 21:30) 
“The man came to the second and said the same thing. And he answered and said, ‘I will, sir’; but he did not go.

(Matthew 21:31) 
“Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.

(Matthew 21:32) 
“For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.

(Matthew 21:33) 
“Hear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.

(Matthew 21:34) 
“When the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his fruits.

(Matthew 21:35) 
“The vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.

(Matthew 21:36) 
“Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they did the same to them.

(Matthew 21:37) 
“Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

(Matthew 21:38) 
“But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’

(Matthew 21:39) 
“And they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

(Matthew 21:40) 
“Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?”

(Matthew 21:41) 
They said to Him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers who will pay him the fruits in their seasons.”

(Matthew 21:42) 
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, This became the chief corner stone; This came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

(Matthew 21:43) 
“Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruit of it.

(Matthew 21:44) 
“And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

(Matthew 21:45) 
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.

(Matthew 21:46) 
And although they sought to arrest Him, they feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet.

(Matthew 22:1) 
Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying:

(Matthew 22:2) 
“The kingdom of the universe is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.

(Matthew 22:3) 
He sent his servants to summon those who were invited, but they refused to come.

(Matthew 22:4) 
Then he sent more servants, saying, ‘Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet!’

(Matthew 22:5) 
But they paid no attention and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his business.

(Matthew 22:6) 
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.

(Matthew 22:7) 
The king was enraged and sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their cities.

(Matthew 22:8) 
Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

(Matthew 22:9) 
Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the banquet whomever you find.’

(Matthew 22:10) 
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

(Matthew 22:11) 
But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in a wedding garment.

(Matthew 22:12) 
He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And the man was speechless.

(Matthew 22:13) 
Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.’

(Matthew 22:14) 
For many are called, but few are chosen.”

(Matthew 22:15) 
Then the Pharisees went off and plotted how to trap Jesus in what he said.

(Matthew 22:16) 
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth, and you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status.

(Matthew 22:17) 
So tell us your opinion: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

(Matthew 22:18) 
But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites?

(Matthew 22:19) 
Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.

(Matthew 22:20) 
Then he said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?”

(Matthew 22:21) 
They replied, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “So give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”

(Matthew 22:22) 
When they heard this, they were amazed, and they left him and went away.

(Matthew 22:23) 
On that day, the Sadducees came to him, saying that there is no resurrection, and they questioned him,

(Matthew 22:24) 
saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’

(Matthew 22:25) 
Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.

(Matthew 22:26) 
The same happened with the second and the third, down to the seventh.

(Matthew 22:27) 
Finally, the woman died.

(Matthew 22:28) 
In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had been married to her.”

(Matthew 22:29) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.

(Matthew 22:30) 
For in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but they will be like the angels of God in the universe.

(Matthew 22:31) 
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said:

(Matthew 22:32) 
‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”

(Matthew 22:33) 
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.

(Matthew 22:34) 
But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

(Matthew 22:35) 
And one of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:

(Matthew 22:36) 
“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”

(Matthew 22:37) 
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”

(Matthew 22:38) 
This is the greatest and first commandment.

(Matthew 22:39) 
And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’

(Matthew 22:40) 
On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”

(Matthew 22:41) 
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

(Matthew 22:42) 
saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”

(Matthew 22:43) 
They said to him, “David’s.”

(Matthew 22:44) 
He said to them, “Then how is it that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying:

(Matthew 22:45) 
‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.”’

(Matthew 22:46) 
If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”

(Matthew 22:47) 
No one could answer him a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him any further.

(Matthew 23:1) 
Jesus then spoke to the crowds of people and to His disciples,

(Matthew 23:2) 
saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their place as the official teachers of Moses' Law."

(Matthew 23:3) 
Therefore, you must observe and do everything they tell you, because they teach God's Law. But do not live according to their works, for they say one thing and do not practice what they preach.

(Matthew 23:4) 
They tie up heavy, burdensome loads of rules and regulations and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves are unwilling to move these burdens with even a single finger.

(Matthew 23:5) 
All of their works are done to be seen and admired by other people. They make their phylacteries very broad—these are the small boxes containing Scripture worn on the forehead and arm during prayer—and they make the fringes of their garments very long.

(Matthew 23:6) 
They love the places of honor at dinner parties and the most prominent seats in the synagogues, which are places of worship and community gathering.

(Matthew 23:7) 
They love greetings of respect in the marketplaces, and they love to be called 'Rabbi'—meaning 'my great one' or 'my master'—by people.

(Matthew 23:8) 
But you, my followers, must not allow yourselves to be called 'Rabbi,' for only one is your Master, who is Christ. All of you are brothers and sisters in Christ.

(Matthew 23:9) 
Do not call anyone on earth your 'father' in a spiritual sense, for you have only one Father, who is in heaven.

(Matthew 23:10) 
Nor are you to be called 'teachers' or 'guides' in this way, for your one and only true Teacher is Christ.

(Matthew 23:11) 
Whoever is greatest among you must be your servant.

(Matthew 23:12) 
For whoever humbles himself will be exalted by God. And whoever exalts himself will be humbled by God.

(Matthew 23:13) 
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter it, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in.

(Matthew 23:14) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses—meaning you exploit and steal from vulnerable women—while making long, showy prayers. Because of this, you will receive a greater judgment from God.

(Matthew 23:15) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you travel across the sea and the dry land to make one convert to Judaism. And when he is made a convert, you make him twice as much a child of Gehenna—a place of eternal punishment and destruction—as yourselves.

(Matthew 23:16) 
Woe to you, you blind guides! You teach, 'Whoever swears an oath by the Temple, it means nothing. But whoever swears an oath by the gold of the Temple, that oath is binding.'

(Matthew 23:17) 
You are foolish and blind! For which is greater: the gold, or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?

(Matthew 23:18) 
And you also say, 'Whoever swears an oath by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever swears an oath by the gift that is on the altar, that oath is binding.'

(Matthew 23:19) 
You are blind! For which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

(Matthew 23:20) 
Therefore, whoever swears an oath by the altar is swearing an oath by it and by everything that is on it.

(Matthew 23:21) 
And whoever swears an oath by the Temple is swearing an oath by it and by God, who dwells within it.

(Matthew 23:22) 
And whoever swears an oath by heaven is swearing an oath by God's throne and by God Himself, who sits upon it.

(Matthew 23:23) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you carefully tithe even the smallest garden herbs like mint, dill, and cumin. Yet you have neglected the more important matters of the Law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness to God. You ought to have practiced these weightier matters without neglecting the others.

(Matthew 23:24) 
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat from your drink, yet you swallow a camel. This means you obsess over minor rules but ignore major commands of God.

(Matthew 23:25) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside, they are full of greed, extortion, and impurity.

(Matthew 23:26) 
You blind Pharisee! First, clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become truly clean. This is about inner spiritual purity before outward appearance.

(Matthew 23:27) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful and clean on the outside to people. But inside, they are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of filth and impurity.

(Matthew 23:28) 
In the same way, on the outside, you appear righteous to people. But inside, you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

(Matthew 23:29) 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the memorials of the righteous.

(Matthew 23:30) 
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'

(Matthew 23:31) 
So you yourselves bear witness against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.

(Matthew 23:32) 
Go on, then, and fill up the measure of your ancestors' guilt.

(Matthew 23:33) 
You serpents, you brood of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of Gehenna—the place of eternal punishment?

(Matthew 23:34) 
Therefore, behold, I am sending to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues, and you will persecute them from city to city.

(Matthew 23:35) 
This is so that all the righteous blood shed on the earth may come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar.

(Matthew 23:36) 
Truly, I tell you, all these things will come upon this present generation.

(Matthew 23:37) 
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I longed to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling to let me!

(Matthew 23:38) 
Behold, your house—meaning your Temple and your city—is being left to you desolate and deserted.

(Matthew 23:39) 
For I tell you, you will not see Me again from now on until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.'

(Matthew 24:24:1) 
And as Jesus was leaving the Temple, He was going away. Then His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the Temple.

(Matthew 24:24:2) 
But He, answering, said to them: "Do you see all these things? Truly, I tell you, not a single stone will be left here upon another stone that will not be thrown down (destroyed)."

(Matthew 24:24:3) 
And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, His disciples came to Him privately, saying: "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age (the completion of time as we know it)?"

(Matthew 24:24:4) 
And Jesus, answering, said to them: "Be careful that no one misleads you:

(Matthew 24:24:5) 
for many will come in my name, saying: 'I am the Anointed One (the Christ)!' and they will mislead many people.

(Matthew 24:24:6) 
For you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed; for it is necessary for these things to happen, but the end is not yet.

(Matthew 24:24:7) 
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be plagues (diseases), and famines, and earthquakes in various places:

(Matthew 24:24:8) 
but all these things are only the beginning of sorrows (or birth pangs).

(Matthew 24:24:9) 
Then they will hand you over to tribulation, and they will kill you; and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.

(Matthew 24:24:10) 
And then many will be scandalized (will fall away from the faith into sin or unbelief), and they will betray one another, and they will hate one another.

(Matthew 24:24:11) 
And many false prophets will rise up, and they will mislead many.

(Matthew 24:24:12) 
And because wickedness has abounded (will increase greatly), the charity (the supernatural love for God and neighbor) of many will grow cold.

(Matthew 24:24:13) 
But he who perseveres (remains steadfast in faith and good works) to the end will be saved.

(Matthew 24:24:14) 
And this Gospel (Good News) of the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world (the entire planet), as a testimony to all nations: and then the end (the consummation of all things) will come.

(Matthew 24:24:15) 
Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place — whoever reads, let him understand:

(Matthew 24:24:16) 
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains:

(Matthew 24:24:17) 
and let him who is on the housetop (the flat roof of his house) not come down to take anything from his house:

(Matthew 24:24:18) 
and let him who is in the field not return to get his cloak.

(Matthew 24:24:19) 
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!

(Matthew 24:24:20) 
And pray that your flight (fleeing) may not be in winter, or on the Sabbath (when travel was restricted by religious law):

(Matthew 24:24:21) 
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be.

(Matthew 24:24:22) 
And unless those days had been shortened, no living thing (no human life) would be saved: but for the sake of the elect (God's chosen people) those days will be shortened.

(Matthew 24:24:23) 
Then if anyone says to you: 'Look, here is the Anointed One (the Christ)!' or 'There!', do not believe it.

(Matthew 24:24:24) 
For false Anointed Ones (false Christs) and false prophets will arise: and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if it were possible, even the elect (God's chosen people).

(Matthew 24:24:25) 
Behold, I have told you beforehand.

(Matthew 24:24:26) 
Therefore, if they say to you: 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out: 'Look, He is in the inner rooms (secret chambers)!' do not believe it.

(Matthew 24:24:27) 
For just as lightning comes from the East and flashes even to the West across the sky: so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:28) 
Wherever the dead body (carrion) is, there the eagles (vultures) will gather.

(Matthew 24:24:29) 
But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky (the visible cosmos), and the celestial powers (the spiritual forces of the heavens) will be shaken.

(Matthew 24:24:30) 
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky: and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn (lament): and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with great power and majesty.

(Matthew 24:24:31) 
And He will send His Angels with a trumpet call and a loud voice: and they will gather His elect (His chosen people) from the four winds (from all directions), from one end of the universe to the other (from the highest reaches of the cosmos to its very ends).

(Matthew 24:24:32) 
Now learn a parable (a lesson) from the fig tree: When its branch is already tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:

(Matthew 24:24:33) 
So also, when you see all these things, know that He (the time of His coming) is near, at the doors.

(Matthew 24:24:34) 
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened (come to pass).

(Matthew 24:24:35) 
The universe and the earth will pass away (will come to an end), but my words will not pass away (will endure forever).

(Matthew 24:24:36) 
But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the Angels of the heavens (the spiritual realms), but the Father alone.

(Matthew 24:24:37) 
For just as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:38) 
For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,

(Matthew 24:24:39) 
and they did not understand (or know) until the flood came and swept them all away: so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.

(Matthew 24:24:40) 
Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken (assumed to God), and the other will be left behind.

(Matthew 24:24:41) 
Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken (assumed to God), and one will be left behind.

(Matthew 24:24:42) 
Therefore, be vigilant (keep watch), for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.

(Matthew 24:24:43) 
But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would certainly have kept watch, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into (dug through).

(Matthew 24:24:44) 
Therefore, you also be ready: for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.

(Matthew 24:24:45) 
Who then, do you think, is the faithful and prudent (wise) servant, whom his master has set over his household (his family), to give them food at the proper time?

(Matthew 24:24:46) 
Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find doing so (carrying out his duty faithfully).

(Matthew 24:24:47) 
Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions (all his property).

(Matthew 24:24:48) 
But if that wicked servant says in his heart: 'My master delays his coming (is taking a long time to return):'

(Matthew 24:24:49) 
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with drunkards:

(Matthew 24:24:50) 
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour when he does not know (is unaware):

(Matthew 24:24:51) 
and will cut him in pieces (severely punish him), and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

(Matthew 25:1) 
At that time, the Kingdom of God will be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

(Matthew 25:2) 
Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.

(Matthew 25:3) 
The foolish ones, when they took their lamps, did not take any oil for them.

(Matthew 25:4) 
But the wise ones took oil in their containers along with their lamps.

(Matthew 25:5) 
As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and fell asleep.

(Matthew 25:6) 
But at midnight, a shout was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming! Go out to meet him!'

(Matthew 25:7) 
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps, preparing them to burn brightly.

(Matthew 25:8) 
But the foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.'

(Matthew 25:9) 
The wise ones answered, saying, 'No, there probably won't be enough for us and for you. Instead, go to those who sell and buy some for yourselves.'

(Matthew 25:10) 
While they were on their way to buy, the bridegroom arrived. And those who were prepared went in with him to the wedding feast, and then the door was shut.

(Matthew 25:11) 
Finally, the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'

(Matthew 25:12) 
But he answered, saying, 'Truly, I tell you, I do not know you.'

(Matthew 25:13) 
Therefore, stay awake and be vigilant, because you do not know the day nor the hour of My return.

(Matthew 25:14) 
For it is just like a man who, going on a journey, called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.

(Matthew 25:15) 
To one, he gave five talents—a very large sum of money or skill. To another, he gave two, and to another, one, to each according to his own ability. And then he immediately left on his journey.

(Matthew 25:16) 
Then the one who had received five talents immediately went and traded with them, and he gained another five talents.

(Matthew 25:17) 
Similarly, the one who had received two talents also gained another two.

(Matthew 25:18) 
But the one who had received one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.

(Matthew 25:19) 
Now, after a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them, requiring each to explain how they used what was given to them.

(Matthew 25:20) 
And the one who had received five talents came forward and brought another five talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me. Behold, I have gained another five on top of that amount!'

(Matthew 25:21) 
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! Because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many things. Come, enter into the joy of your master!'

(Matthew 25:22) 
Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. Behold, I have gained another two on top of that amount!'

(Matthew 25:23) 
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! Because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many things. Come, enter into the joy of your master!'

(Matthew 25:24) 
Then the one who had received one talent also came forward and said, 'Master, I knew that you are a harsh man. You reap where you have not sown, and you gather where you have not scattered any seed.'

(Matthew 25:25) 
And so, out of fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground. Behold, here you have what is yours back again.

(Matthew 25:26) 
But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered!'

(Matthew 25:27) 
Therefore, you should have entrusted my money to the bankers, and then, when I returned, I would have received what is mine with interest, a profit on my investment.

(Matthew 25:28) 
So, take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents.

(Matthew 25:29) 
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him.

(Matthew 25:30) 
And cast this useless servant into the outer darkness, the place of suffering and separation from God. There, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth in despair.

(Matthew 25:31) 
When the Son of Man comes in His divine majesty, and all the Angels are with Him, then He will sit upon the throne of His glory.

(Matthew 25:32) 
And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

(Matthew 25:33) 
And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.

(Matthew 25:34) 
Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the very foundation of the world.'

(Matthew 25:35) 
For I was hungry, and you gave Me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink. I was a stranger, a foreigner in your land, and you welcomed Me into your home.

(Matthew 25:36) 
I was naked, and you clothed Me. I was sick, and you visited Me. I was in prison, and you came to Me.

(Matthew 25:37) 
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?'

(Matthew 25:38) 
Or when did we see You a stranger and welcome You in, or naked and clothe You?

(Matthew 25:39) 
Or when did we see You sick or in prison and come to You?

(Matthew 25:40) 
And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly, I tell you, just as you did it for one of the least of these, My brothers and sisters in faith, you did it for Me.'

(Matthew 25:41) 
Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, not for you.'

(Matthew 25:42) 
For I was hungry, and you gave Me no food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink.

(Matthew 25:43) 
I was a stranger, a foreigner, and you did not welcome Me in. I was naked, and you did not clothe Me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.

(Matthew 25:44) 
Then they also will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and fail to minister to Your needs?'

(Matthew 25:45) 
Then He will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I tell you, just as you did not do it for one of the least of these My brothers and sisters, you did not do it for Me.'

(Matthew 25:46) 
And these will go away into eternal punishment, the ultimate consequence of their choices, but the righteous will go into eternal life, the unending union with God.

(Matthew 26:26:1) 
It came to pass that when Jesus had finished all these discourses, He said to His disciples:

(Matthew 26:26:2) 
“You know that the Passover is coming in two days, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to be crucified.”

(Matthew 26:26:3) 
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.

(Matthew 26:26:4) 
And they formed a plan to seize Jesus by cunning and kill Him.

(Matthew 26:26:5) 
However, they were saying: “Not during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”

(Matthew 26:26:6) 
Now, when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

(Matthew 26:26:7) 
a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it over His head as He was reclining at the table.

(Matthew 26:26:8) 
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying: “Why this waste?

(Matthew 26:26:9) 
This ointment could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor.”

(Matthew 26:26:10) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: “Why are you troubling this woman? For she has done a good work for me.

(Matthew 26:26:11) 
For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.

(Matthew 26:26:12) 
For by pouring this ointment on my body, she has done this as preparation for my burial.

(Matthew 26:26:13) 
Amen, I say to you, wherever this Gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.”

(Matthew 26:26:14) 
Then one of the twelve disciples, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.

(Matthew 26:26:15) 
And he said to them: “What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you?” And they weighed out and agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver.

(Matthew 26:26:16) 
And from that time on, he sought an opportunity to betray Jesus.

(Matthew 26:26:17) 
Now, on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”

(Matthew 26:26:18) 
But Jesus said: “Go into the city to a certain man and say to him: ‘The Teacher says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”

(Matthew 26:26:19) 
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Matthew 26:26:20) 
When evening came, He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.

(Matthew 26:26:21) 
And as they were eating, He said: “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”

(Matthew 26:26:22) 
And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each one began to say: “Surely it is not I, Lord?”

(Matthew 26:26:23) 
But He answered and said: “The one who dips his hand with me into the dish, he will betray me.”

(Matthew 26:26:24) 
“The Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written concerning Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.”

(Matthew 26:26:25) 
Then Judas, who was betraying Him, responded and said: “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus said to him: “You have said it.”

(Matthew 26:26:26) 
Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to His disciples, and said: “Take and eat; this is my Body.”

(Matthew 26:26:27) 
And taking the chalice, He gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: “Drink from this, all of you.”

(Matthew 26:26:28) 
“For this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which will be poured out for many unto the remission of sins.”

(Matthew 26:26:29) 
“And I say to you: I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.”

(Matthew 26:26:30) 
And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

(Matthew 26:26:31) 
Then Jesus said to them: “All of you will stumble because of me this very night. For it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’”

(Matthew 26:26:32) 
“But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.”

(Matthew 26:26:33) 
Peter responded and said to Him: “Even if all others stumble because of you, I will never stumble.”

(Matthew 26:26:34) 
Jesus said to him: “Amen, I say to you, that on this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”

(Matthew 26:26:35) 
Peter said to Him: “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And all the disciples said the same.

(Matthew 26:26:36) 
Then Jesus came with them to a country estate called Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples: “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”

(Matthew 26:26:37) 
And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, He began to be sorrowful and distressed.

(Matthew 26:26:38) 
Then He said to them: “My soul is sorrowful, even to the point of death. Remain here and keep watch with me.”

(Matthew 26:26:39) 
And going forward a little, He fell on His face, praying and saying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”

(Matthew 26:26:40) 
And He came to His disciples and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter: “So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?”

(Matthew 26:26:41) 
“Keep watch and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

(Matthew 26:26:42) 
Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying: “My Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, then your will be done.”

(Matthew 26:26:43) 
And He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

(Matthew 26:26:44) 
And leaving them again, He went away and prayed a third time, saying the same words.

(Matthew 26:26:45) 
Then He came to His disciples and said to them: “Sleep now and take your rest. Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners.”

(Matthew 26:26:46) 
“Rise, let us go! Behold, he who is betraying me has drawn near.”

(Matthew 26:26:47) 
And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.

(Matthew 26:26:48) 
Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying: “Whomever I kiss, that is He; seize Him.”

(Matthew 26:26:49) 
And immediately he came to Jesus and said: “Hail, Rabbi!” And he kissed Him.

(Matthew 26:26:50) 
Jesus said to him: “Friend, for what purpose have you come?” Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and seized Him.

(Matthew 26:26:51) 
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.

(Matthew 26:26:52) 
Then Jesus said to him: “Return your sword to its place, for all who take up the sword will perish by the sword.”

(Matthew 26:26:53) 
“Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and He would immediately send me more than twelve legions of angels?”

(Matthew 26:26:54) 
“How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen in this way?”

(Matthew 26:26:55) 
At that very hour, Jesus said to the crowds: “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to apprehend me? Day after day I sat teaching among you in the Temple, and you did not seize me.”

(Matthew 26:26:56) 
“But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.

(Matthew 26:26:57) 
Then those who had seized Jesus led Him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and elders were gathered.

(Matthew 26:26:58) 
But Peter followed Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and sat with the servants to see the outcome.

(Matthew 26:26:59) 
Now the chief priests and the entire council were seeking false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death.

(Matthew 26:26:60) 
But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last, however, two false witnesses came,

(Matthew 26:26:61) 
and they said: “This man said: ‘I can destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”

(Matthew 26:26:62) 
And the high priest stood up and said to Him: “Do you answer nothing concerning what these men testify against you?”

(Matthew 26:26:63) 
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him: “I put you under oath by the Living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”

(Matthew 26:26:64) 
Jesus said to him: “You have said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power of God, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”

(Matthew 26:26:65) 
Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.

(Matthew 26:26:66) 
What do you think?” And they answered and said: “He is guilty of death.”

(Matthew 26:26:67) 
Then they spit in His face and struck Him with their fists. Others slapped Him in the face,

(Matthew 26:26:68) 
saying: “Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who is it that struck you?”

(Matthew 26:26:69) 
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying: “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”

(Matthew 26:26:70) 
But he denied it before everyone, saying: “I do not know what you are talking about.”

(Matthew 26:26:71) 
And when he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there: “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”

(Matthew 26:26:72) 
And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”

(Matthew 26:26:73) 
And after a little while, those who were standing by came and said to Peter: “Certainly, you too are one of them, for your dialect and accent betray you.”

(Matthew 26:26:74) 
Then he began to curse and swear, saying that he did not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed.

(Matthew 26:26:75) 
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which He had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And going outside, he wept bitterly.

(Matthew 27:1) 
When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people met together to conspire against Jesus and to put Him to death.

(Matthew 27:2) 
They bound Him, led Him away, and gave Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.

(Matthew 27:3) 
When Judas, who betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,

(Matthew 27:4) 
saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? You take care of it."

(Matthew 27:5) 
So Judas threw the silver into the temple, left, and went and hanged himself.

(Matthew 27:6) 
The chief priests took the silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, since it is blood money."

(Matthew 27:7) 
They conferred and bought the potter's field with the money, to be used as a burial place for strangers.

(Matthew 27:8) 
Therefore, that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.

(Matthew 27:9) 
Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one whose worth was set by the sons of Israel,

(Matthew 27:10) 
and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

(Matthew 27:11) 
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You have said it."

(Matthew 27:12) 
But when He was accused by the chief priests and the elders, He made no reply.

(Matthew 27:13) 
Then Pilate said to Him, "Do you not hear how many things they are accusing You of?"

(Matthew 27:14) 
But He did not answer him one word, so the governor was greatly amazed.

(Matthew 27:15) 
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner whom they wanted.

(Matthew 27:16) 
At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

(Matthew 27:17) 
So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"

(Matthew 27:18) 
For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.

(Matthew 27:19) 
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."

(Matthew 27:20) 
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.

(Matthew 27:21) 
The governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."

(Matthew 27:22) 
Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let Him be crucified."

(Matthew 27:23) 
The governor said, "Why? What evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified."

(Matthew 27:24) 
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this Man’s blood; see to it yourselves."

(Matthew 27:25) 
And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"

(Matthew 27:26) 
Then he released Barabbas for them; but Jesus he scourged and handed over to be crucified.

(Matthew 27:27) 
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around Him.

(Matthew 27:28) 
And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.

(Matthew 27:29) 
And they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"

(Matthew 27:30) 
And they spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the head.

(Matthew 27:31) 
After they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him and put His own garments back on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.

(Matthew 27:32) 
As they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry His cross.

(Matthew 27:33) 
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,

(Matthew 27:34) 
they gave Him wine to drink mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He was unwilling to drink.

(Matthew 27:35) 
And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves by casting lots. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots."

(Matthew 27:36) 
And sitting down, they were guarding Him there.

(Matthew 27:37) 
And above His head they put up the charge against Him, which read, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."

(Matthew 27:38) 
Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.

(Matthew 27:39) 
And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads

(Matthew 27:40) 
and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."

(Matthew 27:41) 
In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking Him and saying,

(Matthew 27:42) 
"He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him."

(Matthew 27:43) 
"He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He delights in Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"

(Matthew 27:44) 
The robbers who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him in the same way.

(Matthew 27:45) 
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came over all the land.

(Matthew 27:46) 
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"

(Matthew 27:47) 
And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, were saying, "This man is calling for Elijah."

(Matthew 27:48) 
Immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.

(Matthew 27:49) 
But the rest said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him."

(Matthew 27:50) 
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.

(Matthew 27:51) 
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split,

(Matthew 27:52) 
and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;

(Matthew 27:53) 
and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.

(Matthew 27:54) 
Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"

(Matthew 27:55) 
Many women were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.

(Matthew 27:56) 
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

(Matthew 27:57) 
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.

(Matthew 27:58) 
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.

(Matthew 27:59) 
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

(Matthew 27:60) 
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.

(Matthew 27:61) 
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.

(Matthew 27:62) 
Now on the next day, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,

(Matthew 27:63) 
and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I am to rise again.'

(Matthew 27:64) 
"So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."

(Matthew 27:65) 
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how."

(Matthew 27:66) 
And they went and made the tomb secure, and sealed the stone, along with the guard.

(Matthew 28:1) 
Late on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.

(Matthew 28:2) 
Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from the universe. He approached the tomb, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.

(Matthew 28:3) 
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.

(Matthew 28:4) 
Because the guards were so terrified of him, they were terrified and became like dead men.

(Matthew 28:5) 
The angel spoke to the women, saying, “Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

(Matthew 28:6) 
He isn’t here. He has risen, just as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord was lying.

(Matthew 28:7) 
Then go quickly, and tell His disciples that He has risen. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see Him there. Behold, I have told you.”

(Matthew 28:8) 
So the women left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy. They ran to tell His disciples.

(Matthew 28:9) 
Suddenly, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” They approached, held onto His feet, and worshipped Him.

(Matthew 28:10) 
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee, and they will see Me there.”

(Matthew 28:11) 
While they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.

(Matthew 28:12) 
When they had assembled with the elders, they took counsel and gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,

(Matthew 28:13) 
saying, “Tell everyone, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.’

(Matthew 28:14) 
And if the governor hears about this, we will persuade him and keep you out of trouble.”

(Matthew 28:15) 
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.

(Matthew 28:16) 
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had instructed them to go.

(Matthew 28:17) 
And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some still doubted.

(Matthew 28:18) 
Jesus came near and spoke to them, saying, “All power in the universe and on earth has been given to Me.

(Matthew 28:19) 
Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

(Matthew 28:20) 
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, even until the end of the age.”

(Mark 1:1) 
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

(Mark 1:2) 
Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way before you.”

(Mark 1:3) 
The voice of one crying in the desert: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.”

(Mark 1:4) 
John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

(Mark 1:5) 
And all the land of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

(Mark 1:6) 
And John was clothed in camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

(Mark 1:7) 
And he preached, saying: “There comes after me the One who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.”

(Mark 1:8) 
I have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”

(Mark 1:9) 
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

(Mark 1:10) 
And immediately, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open, and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.

(Mark 1:11) 
And there came a voice from the heavens: “You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.”

(Mark 1:12) 
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.

(Mark 1:13) 
And he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan; and he was with the beasts, and the angels ministered to him.

(Mark 1:14) 
And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God,

(Mark 1:15) 
and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the Gospel.”

(Mark 1:16) 
And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

(Mark 1:17) 
And Jesus said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men.”

(Mark 1:18) 
And immediately they left their nets and followed him.

(Mark 1:19) 
And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.

(Mark 1:20) 
And immediately he called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

(Mark 1:21) 
And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.

(Mark 1:22) 
And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

(Mark 1:23) 
And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

(Mark 1:24) 
saying: “What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.”

(Mark 1:25) 
And Jesus rebuked him, saying: “Be quiet, and come out of him.”

(Mark 1:26) 
And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.

(Mark 1:27) 
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying: “What is this? A new teaching with authority! For he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”

(Mark 1:28) 
And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the region of Galilee.

(Mark 1:29) 
And immediately, when they came out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

(Mark 1:30) 
Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.

(Mark 1:31) 
And he came and lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she served them.

(Mark 1:32) 
And when evening had come, after the sun went down, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.

(Mark 1:33) 
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.

(Mark 1:34) 
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.

(Mark 1:35) 
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and went to a lonely place, and there he prayed.

(Mark 1:36) 
And Simon and those who were with him followed him.

(Mark 1:37) 
And when they found him, they said to him: “Everyone is looking for you.”

(Mark 1:38) 
And he said to them: “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”

(Mark 1:39) 
And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

(Mark 1:40) 
And a leper came to him, beseeching him, and kneeling said to him: “If you will, you can make me clean.”

(Mark 1:41) 
And Jesus, moved with pity, stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.”

(Mark 1:42) 
And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.

(Mark 1:43) 
And immediately he sternly warned him and sent him away,

(Mark 1:44) 
and said to him: “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.”

(Mark 1:45) 
But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the word, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.

(Mark 2:1) 
Jesus returned to Capernaum a few days later.

(Mark 2:2) 
The news spread that he was at home.

(Mark 2:3) 
A crowd gathered, so many that there was no room left, not even near the door. Jesus began to preach the word of God to them.

(Mark 2:4) 
Some men arrived, carrying a paralytic. The men carried him.

(Mark 2:5) 
Because of the crowd, they couldn't bring him to Jesus. So, they uncovered the roof above where Jesus was and made an opening, then they lowered the man on his mat.

(Mark 2:6) 
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”

(Mark 2:7) 
Some scribes were sitting there, and they began to think to themselves:

(Mark 2:8) 
“Why does this man speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”

(Mark 2:9) 
Jesus, immediately aware in his spirit that they were thinking this, said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?”

(Mark 2:10) 
“Which is easier: to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?”

(Mark 2:11) 
“But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralytic,

(Mark 2:12) 
“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”

(Mark 2:13) 
He got up immediately, took his mat, and walked out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

(Mark 2:14) 
Jesus went out again to the sea, and the whole crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.

(Mark 2:15) 
As he was walking along, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.

(Mark 2:16) 
While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.

(Mark 2:17) 
When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

(Mark 2:18) 
Hearing this, Jesus said to them, “Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

(Mark 2:19) 
John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came to Jesus and asked, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”

(Mark 2:20) 
Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?

(Mark 2:21) 
As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

(Mark 2:22) 
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.

(Mark 2:23) 
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece tears away from the old, and the tear becomes worse.

(Mark 2:24) 
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is to be put into new wineskins.”

(Mark 2:25) 
One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the grainfields, his disciples began to pick some heads of grain.

(Mark 2:26) 
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”

(Mark 2:27) 
He answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?

(Mark 2:28) 
He entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for the priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions.”

(Mark 3:1) 
Again, He entered the synagogue. And there was a man there whose hand was shriveled.

(Mark 3:2) 
And they watched Him to see if He would heal on the Sabbath so that they could accuse Him.

(Mark 3:3) 
And He said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in the middle.”

(Mark 3:4) 
And He said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent.

(Mark 3:5) 
And looking around at them with anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out; and his hand was restored.

(Mark 3:6) 
And immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to conspire against Him, as to how they might destroy Him.

(Mark 3:7) 
And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed Him,

(Mark 3:8) 
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan. And those near Tyre and Sidon, a great crowd, hearing all that He was doing, came to Him.

(Mark 3:9) 
And He told His disciples that a small boat should be ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they crush Him.

(Mark 3:10) 
For He healed many, so that all those who had afflictions were pressing Him in order to touch Him.

(Mark 3:11) 
And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and cry out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”

(Mark 3:12) 
And He sternly warned them not to make Him known.

(Mark 3:13) 
And going up on the mountain, He called to Him those whom He Himself willed, and they came to Him.

(Mark 3:14) 
And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,

(Mark 3:15) 
and have authority to cast out demons.

(Mark 3:16) 
And He appointed Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;

(Mark 3:17) 
and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder;

(Mark 3:18) 
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,

(Mark 3:19) 
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.

(Mark 3:20) 
And He went home. And the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat a meal.

(Mark 3:21) 
And when His family heard it, they went out to seize Him, for they were saying, “He is out of His mind.”

(Mark 3:22) 
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of demons He casts out demons.”

(Mark 3:23) 
And He called them to Himself and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?

(Mark 3:24) 
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

(Mark 3:25) 
And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.

(Mark 3:26) 
And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.

(Mark 3:27) 
But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.

(Mark 3:28) 
“Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter,

(Mark 3:29) 
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”

(Mark 3:30) 
For they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”

(Mark 3:31) 
And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to Him, calling Him.

(Mark 3:32) 
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are outside, seeking You.”

(Mark 3:33) 
And answering them, He said, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”

(Mark 3:34) 
And looking around at those who sat around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!

(Mark 3:35) 
For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”

(Mark 4:1) 
And again, He began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd gathered around Him, so that He entered a boat and sat on the sea. And all the crowd was on the land near the sea.

(Mark 4:2) 
And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching:

(Mark 4:3) 
Listen: behold, a sower went out to sow.

(Mark 4:4) 
And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds of the sky came and ate it up.

(Mark 4:5) 
And some fell upon stony ground where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.

(Mark 4:6) 
And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.

(Mark 4:7) 
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

(Mark 4:8) 
And some fell on good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased, and produced, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.

(Mark 4:9) 
And He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 4:10) 
And when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.

(Mark 4:11) 
And He said to them, “To you has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,

(Mark 4:12) 
so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they should turn and their sins be forgiven them.”

(Mark 4:13) 
And He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?

(Mark 4:14) 
The sower sows the word.

(Mark 4:15) 
And these are the ones by the wayside, where the word is sown. And immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.

(Mark 4:16) 
And these are the ones sown on stony ground: who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.

(Mark 4:17) 
And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they are scandalized.

(Mark 4:18) 
And these are the ones sown among thorns: they are those who hear the word,

(Mark 4:19) 
and the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

(Mark 4:20) 
And those are the ones sown on good ground: who hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.”

(Mark 4:21) 
And He said to them, “Does a lamp come to be put under a basket, or under a bed? Is it not to be put on a lampstand?

(Mark 4:22) 
For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.

(Mark 4:23) 
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 4:24) 
And He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be added.

(Mark 4:25) 
For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”

(Mark 4:26) 
And He said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed on the earth,

(Mark 4:27) 
and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.

(Mark 4:28) 
For the earth bears fruit of itself: first the blade, then the head, and then the full grain in the head.

(Mark 4:29) 
But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”

(Mark 4:30) 
And He said, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we present it?

(Mark 4:31) 
It is like a mustard seed which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;

(Mark 4:32) 
but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the sky can dwell under its shade.”

(Mark 4:33) 
And with many such parables, He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.

(Mark 4:34) 
But without a parable, He did not speak to them. But privately to His own disciples, He explained everything.

(Mark 4:35) 
And on that day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us pass over to the other side.”

(Mark 4:36) 
And leaving the crowd, they took Him along in the boat, and there were also other boats with Him.

(Mark 4:37) 
And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that it was already filling.

(Mark 4:38) 
But He was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”

(Mark 4:39) 
Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.

(Mark 4:40) 
And He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?”

(Mark 4:41) 
And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”

(Mark 5:1) 
They went to the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes. As soon as He disembarked from the boat, a man possessed by an evil spirit met Him there from the tombs,

(Mark 5:2) 
The man lived in the tombs. No one could bind him anymore, not even with chains.

(Mark 5:3) 
Often he had been bound with shackles and chains. But he would tear apart the chains and break the shackles, and no one could control him.

(Mark 5:4) 
Day and night among the tombs and in the mountains, he was constantly shouting and cutting himself with stones.

(Mark 5:5) 
Seeing Jesus from afar, he ran to Him and bowed down,

(Mark 5:6) 
shouting in a loud voice, “What have You to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me.”

(Mark 5:7) 
Jesus was already saying to him, “Come out, unclean spirit, from this man.”

(Mark 5:8) 
Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”

(Mark 5:9) 
And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.

(Mark 5:10) 
A large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.

(Mark 5:11) 
And the spirits begged Him, saying, “Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.”

(Mark 5:12) 
Jesus gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned there.

(Mark 5:13) 
Those who were tending them ran off and reported it in the city and the surrounding countryside. People went out to see what had happened.

(Mark 5:14) 
They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.

(Mark 5:15) 
Those who had seen what had happened told them the whole story about the demon-possessed man and the swine.

(Mark 5:16) 
Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.

(Mark 5:17) 
As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him to go with him.

(Mark 5:18) 
Jesus did not let him, but said to him, “Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.”

(Mark 5:19) 
So the man went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and all those who heard it were amazed.

(Mark 5:20) 
When Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him, and He was by the sea.

(Mark 5:21) 
Then one of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came to Jesus. Seeing Him, he fell at His feet,

(Mark 5:22) 
and begged Him repeatedly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and put Your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.”

(Mark 5:23) 
So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around Him.

(Mark 5:24) 
And a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.

(Mark 5:25) 
She had heard about Jesus and came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His cloak,

(Mark 5:26) 
because she said, “If I just touch His clothes, I will be healed.”

(Mark 5:27) 
Immediately her flow of blood dried up, and she realized in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

(Mark 5:28) 
At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from Him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched My clothes?”

(Mark 5:29) 
His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing around You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’

(Mark 5:30) 
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

(Mark 5:31) 
The woman, knowing what had happened to her, came with fear and trembling, and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.

(Mark 5:32) 
He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free from your affliction.”

(Mark 5:33) 
While He was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue official’s house and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”

(Mark 5:34) 
But Jesus overheard what they were saying and said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”

(Mark 5:35) 
He allowed no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.

(Mark 5:36) 
They came to the home of the synagogue official, and Jesus saw a commotion, with people weeping and wailing loudly.

(Mark 5:37) 
When He entered, He said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.”

(Mark 5:38) 
And they laughed at Him. But He put them all out and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with Him and went in where the child was.

(Mark 5:39) 
Taking her by the hand, He said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”

(Mark 5:40) 
Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around (for she was twelve years old). And the people were utterly amazed.

(Mark 5:41) 
He gave them strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

(Mark 6:1) 
Jesus left that place and returned to His home country. His disciples followed Him.

(Mark 6:2) 
When the Sabbath arrived, He began teaching in the synagogue. Many people heard Him and were astonished by His teaching. They asked, “Where did He get these things? What is this wisdom given to Him? And what are these mighty works that are done by His hands?”

(Mark 6:3) 
“Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joseph, and Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us?” And they took offense at Him.

(Mark 6:4) 
Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.”

(Mark 6:5) 
And He could do no mighty works there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.

(Mark 6:6) 
And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went around teaching in the surrounding villages.

(Mark 6:7) 
He called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.

(Mark 6:8) 
He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff: no bag, no bread, and no money in their belts.

(Mark 6:9) 
They were to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.

(Mark 6:10) 
He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.

(Mark 6:11) 
And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them when you leave. Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.”

(Mark 6:12) 
So they went out and preached that people should repent.

(Mark 6:13) 
And they cast out many demons, and they anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed them.

(Mark 6:14) 
King Herod heard about Him, for His name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in Him.”

(Mark 6:15) 
Others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets.”

(Mark 6:16) 
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”

(Mark 6:17) 
For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.

(Mark 6:18) 
For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”

(Mark 6:19) 
And Herodias was angry with him and wanted to kill him, but she could not.

(Mark 6:20) 
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him.

(Mark 6:21) 
But when a convenient time came, Herod gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.

(Mark 6:22) 
When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who were with him. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”

(Mark 6:23) 
And he swore an oath to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even up to half of my kingdom.”

(Mark 6:24) 
She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”

(Mark 6:25) 
And immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter right away.”

(Mark 6:26) 
And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oath and because of those who were with him, he did not want to break his word to her.

(Mark 6:27) 
And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded that John’s head be brought. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,

(Mark 6:28) 
and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

(Mark 6:29) 
When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

(Mark 6:30) 
The apostles returned to Jesus and reported to Him all that they had done and taught.

(Mark 6:31) 
He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.

(Mark 6:32) 
And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.

(Mark 6:33) 
Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.

(Mark 6:34) 
When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.

(Mark 6:35) 
And when it was already late, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and it is already late.

(Mark 6:36) 
Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat, for they have nothing to eat.”

(Mark 6:37) 
But He answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to Him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?”

(Mark 6:38) 
And He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”

(Mark 6:39) 
Then He commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.

(Mark 6:40) 
They reclined in companies of hundreds and of fifties.

(Mark 6:41) 
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to the universe and blessed and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all.

(Mark 6:42) 
And they all ate and were satisfied.

(Mark 6:43) 
And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.

(Mark 6:44) 
Those who ate the loaves were about five thousand men.

(Mark 6:45) 
Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He sent the crowd away.

(Mark 6:46) 
And after He had taken leave of them, He went up on the mountain to pray.

(Mark 6:47) 
When evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and He was alone on the land.

(Mark 6:48) 
And seeing that they were straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, He came to them in the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them.

(Mark 6:49) 
But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost, and they cried out.

(Mark 6:50) 
For they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and said to them, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

(Mark 6:51) 
Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,

(Mark 6:52) 
because they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.

(Mark 6:53) 
When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.

(Mark 6:54) 
And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him

(Mark 6:55) 
and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to where they heard He was.

(Mark 6:56) 
And wherever He went, into villages or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch even the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.

(Mark 7:1) 
Then the Pharisees and some scribes came together to see Him, having traveled from Jerusalem.

(Mark 7:2) 
And when they saw some of His disciples eating food with hands that were not washed—that is, common hands—they criticized them.

(Mark 7:3) 
The Pharisees and all the Jews don't eat unless they wash their hands often, holding fast to the traditions of their elders:

(Mark 7:4) 
And after coming from the marketplace, they don't eat unless they wash first. There are many other traditions which they have received to keep, such as washing cups, jugs, bronze vessels, and beds.

(Mark 7:5) 
Then the Pharisees and scribes questioned Him: “Why do Your disciples not live according to the traditions of the elders, but eat food with common hands?”

(Mark 7:6) 
He responded by saying to them: “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.’

(Mark 7:7) 
‘In vain they worship Me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.’

(Mark 7:8) 
‘For, abandoning the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men: washing of jugs and cups, and many other similar things you do.’

(Mark 7:9) 
And He said to them: “You do very well at making the commandment of God invalid, so that you can establish your own tradition.”

(Mark 7:10) 
For Moses said: ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must surely die.’

(Mark 7:11) 
But you say: ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Corban” (which means, a gift), whatever profit you might have received from me,’

(Mark 7:12) 
you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,

(Mark 7:13) 
making the word of God invalid through your tradition, which you have handed down. And you do many things similar to these.”

(Mark 7:14) 
And, having called the crowd again, He said to them: “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand.

(Mark 7:15) 
There is nothing outside a man which, entering into him, can defile him; but the things which come out of the man, these are what defile the man.

(Mark 7:16) 
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Mark 7:17) 
And when He entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.

(Mark 7:18) 
And He said to them: “Are you also as unintelligent? Don’t you understand that everything that enters a man from outside cannot defile him,

(Mark 7:19) 
because it doesn’t enter his heart, but his stomach, and it goes out into the latrine, eliminating all the food?”

(Mark 7:20) 
But He said, “What comes out of a man, that defiles the man.

(Mark 7:21) 
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders,

(Mark 7:22) 
adulteries, acts of greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.

(Mark 7:23) 
All these evils proceed from within and defile the man.”

(Mark 7:24) 
Then, getting up, He went away to the area of Tyre and Sidon. And, entering a house, He didn’t want anyone to know, and yet He couldn’t remain hidden.

(Mark 7:25) 
For a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit, immediately after hearing about Him, came and fell at His feet.

(Mark 7:26) 
The woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. And she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.

(Mark 7:27) 
He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

(Mark 7:28) 
But she responded, “Yes, Lord; but even the dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of the children.”

(Mark 7:29) 
And He said to her: “Because of this word, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”

(Mark 7:30) 
And going home, she found the girl lying on the bed, and the demon had gone out.

(Mark 7:31) 
Then, departing again from the territory of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the territory of the Decapolis.

(Mark 7:32) 
And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and mute. And they begged Him to place His hand on him.

(Mark 7:33) 
And, taking him away from the crowd privately, He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue.

(Mark 7:34) 
Then, looking up to the sky, He groaned and said to him, “Ephphatha,” which means, “Be opened.”

(Mark 7:35) 
And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he was speaking correctly.

(Mark 7:36) 
And He commanded them not to tell anyone. But as much as He commanded them, so much the more did they proclaim it:

(Mark 7:37) 
and they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak!”

(Mark 8:1) 
During those days, after a great crowd had gathered but didn't have anything to eat, Jesus summoned the disciples and told them:

(Mark 8:2) 
“I have pity on the crowd because they’ve been with me for three days, and they don’t have anything to eat.

(Mark 8:3) 
If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will weaken on the way, because some of them have come from far away.”

(Mark 8:4) 
His disciples responded to him: “How can someone possibly feed them with bread here in the desert?”

(Mark 8:5) 
Jesus then asked them: “How many loaves of bread do you have?” They replied: “Seven.”

(Mark 8:6) 
He ordered the crowd to recline on the ground. Then, taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the crowd. They did so.

(Mark 8:7) 
They also had a few small fish. Jesus blessed them and ordered that they be put before the crowd.

(Mark 8:8) 
Everyone ate and was satisfied. They collected what was left of the fragments—seven baskets full.

(Mark 8:9) 
There were about four thousand people eating, and Jesus sent them away.

(Mark 8:10) 
Immediately, He got into a boat with His disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.

(Mark 8:11) 
Then the Pharisees came out and began to debate with Him, asking for a sign from the sky, testing Him.

(Mark 8:12) 
He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”

(Mark 8:13) 
He left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side of the lake.

(Mark 8:14) 
They had forgotten to bring bread. They had only one loaf with them in the boat.

(Mark 8:15) 
Jesus then commanded them, saying: “Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”

(Mark 8:16) 
They reasoned among themselves, saying: “It’s because we have no bread.”

(Mark 8:17) 
Jesus, aware of this, said to them: “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Don’t you yet understand or comprehend? Do you still have hardened hearts?

(Mark 8:18) 
Do you have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear? Don’t you remember?

(Mark 8:19) 
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of fragments did you gather?” They said to Him: “Twelve.”

(Mark 8:20) 
“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets of fragments did you gather?” They said to Him: “Seven.”

(Mark 8:21) 
Then He said to them: “How is it that you still do not understand?”

(Mark 8:22) 
They came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged Him to touch him.

(Mark 8:23) 
Taking the blind man by the hand, He led him outside the village. Then, spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.

(Mark 8:24) 
The man looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking around.”

(Mark 8:25) 
Then Jesus laid His hands on his eyes again, and he saw clearly, and his sight was restored. He could then see everything perfectly.

(Mark 8:26) 
Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not go into the village.”

(Mark 8:27) 
Jesus and His disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He asked His disciples, “Who do people say that I am?”

(Mark 8:28) 
They replied, “John the Baptist. Others say Elijah, and others say one of the prophets.”

(Mark 8:29) 
Then He asked them, “But who do *you* say that I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”

(Mark 8:30) 
He strongly warned them not to tell anyone about Him.

(Mark 8:31) 
Jesus then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and then rise three days later.

(Mark 8:32) 
He spoke openly about this. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.

(Mark 8:33) 
But Jesus turned, and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan, because you are not thinking the things of God, but the things of men.”

(Mark 8:34) 
Then, calling the crowd to Himself along with His disciples, Jesus said to them: “If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.

(Mark 8:35) 
For whoever wants to save his own life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the Gospel will save it.

(Mark 8:36) 
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?

(Mark 8:37) 
Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

(Mark 8:38) 
If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.

(Mark 9:1) 
And He was telling them: “Truly, I say to you, some of those standing here will not experience death until they see the reign of God coming with power.”

(Mark 9:2) 
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, and led them up to a high mountain apart by themselves, and He was transfigured before them.

(Mark 9:3) 
And His garments became shining, extremely white as snow, of a whiteness no fuller on earth can produce.

(Mark 9:4) 
And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.

(Mark 9:5) 
Then Peter responded, and said to Jesus: “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. So, let us build three tabernacles—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

(Mark 9:6) 
For he did not know what he was saying, because they were overcome with fear.

(Mark 9:7) 
And a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying: “This is My beloved Son, hear Him.”

(Mark 9:8) 
And immediately, looking around, they saw no one any more, except Jesus only with them.

(Mark 9:9) 
And as they were coming down from the mountain, He commanded them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

(Mark 9:10) 
And they kept the word to themselves, questioning among themselves what this “rising from the dead” might be.

(Mark 9:11) 
And they questioned Him, saying: “Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

(Mark 9:12) 
Then He, answering, said to them: “Elijah does come first, and will restore all things. But how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be despised?

(Mark 9:13) 
But I tell you, that Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him.”

(Mark 9:14) 
And coming to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing with them.

(Mark 9:15) 
And immediately the whole crowd, seeing Jesus, were astonished, and running to Him, they greeted Him.

(Mark 9:16) 
And He asked them: “What are you disputing among yourselves?”

(Mark 9:17) 
And one of the crowd responded, and said: “Teacher, I brought my son to You because he has an unclean spirit.

(Mark 9:18) 
And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. And I told Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”

(Mark 9:19) 
Then He answered them: “O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring him to Me.”

(Mark 9:20) 
And they brought him to Him. And as soon as the spirit saw Him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. And falling on the ground, he rolled around, foaming at the mouth.

(Mark 9:21) 
And He asked his father: “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said: “From childhood.

(Mark 9:22) 
And often it has thrown him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if You can do anything, help us and have pity on us.”

(Mark 9:23) 
Jesus said to him: “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”

(Mark 9:24) 
And immediately the father of the boy cried out with tears, saying: “I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.”

(Mark 9:25) 
And when Jesus saw that the crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to it: “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.”

(Mark 9:26) 
And crying out and tearing him severely, it came out. And the boy became like a corpse, so that many said he was dead.

(Mark 9:27) 
But Jesus, taking his hand, lifted him up, and he arose.

(Mark 9:28) 
And when He had entered the house, His disciples asked Him privately: “Why could we not cast it out?”

(Mark 9:29) 
And He said to them: “This kind can be cast out by nothing except by prayer and fasting.”

(Mark 9:30) 
And departing from there, they were passing through Galilee. And He did not want anyone to know, because He was teaching His disciples, and He was saying to them: “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and being killed, after three days, He will rise.”

(Mark 9:31) 
But they did not understand the word, and they were afraid to ask Him.

(Mark 9:32) 
And they came to Capernaum. And when they had entered the house, He was asking them: “What were you arguing about on the way?”

(Mark 9:33) 
But they were silent, for on the way they had argued among themselves about who was the greatest.

(Mark 9:34) 
And sitting down, He called the twelve, and said to them: “If anyone wishes to be first, he will be last of all and the servant of all.”

(Mark 9:35) 
And taking a child, He set him in their midst, and embracing him, He said to them:

(Mark 9:36) 
“Whoever receives one of these children in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me, does not receive Me but Him who sent Me.”

(Mark 9:37) 
John answered Him, saying: “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, who does not follow us, and we forbade him.”

(Mark 9:38) 
But Jesus said: “Do not forbid him, for there is no one who does a mighty work in My name, and can soon speak evil of Me.”

(Mark 9:39) 
For he who is not against us is for us.

(Mark 9:40) 
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.

(Mark 9:41) 
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

(Mark 9:42) 
And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, than to having two hands, go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,

(Mark 9:43) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:44) 
And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into eternal life lame, than to having two feet, be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire,

(Mark 9:45) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:46) 
And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than to having two eyes, be cast into the hell of fire,

(Mark 9:47) 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.

(Mark 9:48) 
For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.

(Mark 9:49) 
Salt is good, but if salt becomes tasteless, with what will you season it?

(Mark 9:50) 
Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace among yourselves.”

(Mark 10:1) 
And then, He rose and went into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. Again, the crowds gathered to Him, and He was teaching them again.

(Mark 10:2) 
And the Pharisees approached Him and questioned Him: "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" They were trying to trip Him up.

(Mark 10:3) 
But He answering, said to them: "What did Moses command you?"

(Mark 10:4) 
They said: "Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away."

(Mark 10:5) 
To whom Jesus answering, said: "Because of the hardness of your hearts, he wrote you this commandment."

(Mark 10:6) 
But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.

(Mark 10:7) 
For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife.

(Mark 10:8) 
And the two will be in one flesh. Therefore, they are no longer two, but one flesh.

(Mark 10:9) 
What God has joined together, let no man separate."

(Mark 10:10) 
And in the house, the disciples again questioned Him about the same matter.

(Mark 10:11) 
And He said to them: "Whoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.

(Mark 10:12) 
And if a woman puts away her husband, and is married to another, she commits adultery.

(Mark 10:13) 
And they were bringing little children to Him, that He might touch them. But the disciples were rebuking those who were bringing them.

(Mark 10:14) 
When Jesus saw this, He was indignant, and said to them: "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them: for of such is the kingdom of God.

(Mark 10:15) 
Amen I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God, as a child, will not enter into it."

(Mark 10:16) 
And embracing them, and imposing hands upon them, He blessed them.

(Mark 10:17) 
And as He was going out into the way, a certain man, running up and kneeling to Him, was asking Him: "Good Master, what must I do that I may receive eternal life?"

(Mark 10:18) 
And Jesus said to him: "Why do you call Me good? No one is good, but God alone.

(Mark 10:19) 
You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Do not commit fraud. Honor your father and your mother.'

(Mark 10:20) 
But he answering, said to Him: "Master, I have kept all these things from my youth."

(Mark 10:21) 
And Jesus looking upon him, loved him, and said to him: "One thing is lacking to you: go, sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow Me."

(Mark 10:22) 
But he, being saddened by the word, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

(Mark 10:23) 
And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples: "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"

(Mark 10:24) 
But the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus again answering, said to them: "Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"

(Mark 10:25) 
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."

(Mark 10:26) 
And they were much more astonished, saying among themselves: "Who then can be saved?"

(Mark 10:27) 
And Jesus, looking upon them, said: "With men it is impossible; but not with God. For all things are possible with God."

(Mark 10:28) 
And Peter began to say to Him: "Behold, we have left all things, and have followed You."

(Mark 10:29) 
Jesus answering, said: "Amen I say to you, there is no one who has left home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for My sake, and for the Gospel,

(Mark 10:30) 
who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life everlasting.

(Mark 10:31) 
But many that are first will be last, and the last will be first."

(Mark 10:32) 
And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus was preceding them, and they were astonished: and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, He began to tell them the things that were to happen to Him.

(Mark 10:33) 
Saying: "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests, and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and will deliver Him to the Gentiles:

(Mark 10:34) 
And they will mock Him, and spit upon Him, and scourge Him, and kill Him: and the third day He will rise again."

(Mark 10:35) 
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, saying: "Master, we want You to do whatever we ask."

(Mark 10:36) 
But He said to them: "What do you want Me to do for you?"

(Mark 10:37) 
And they said to Him: "Grant to us that one of us may sit at Your right hand, and the other at Your left, in Your glory."

(Mark 10:38) 
But Jesus said to them: "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the chalice that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"

(Mark 10:39) 
They said to Him: "We can." And Jesus said to them: "The chalice indeed that I drink, you shall drink: and with the baptism that I am baptized, you shall be baptized.

(Mark 10:40) 
But to sit at My right hand or at My left is not Mine to give to you, but to those for whom it is prepared."

(Mark 10:41) 
And the ten hearing it, began to be indignant at James and John.

(Mark 10:42) 
But Jesus calling them, said to them: "You know that those who are seen to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them: and their great ones exercise power over them.

(Mark 10:43) 
But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will become greater among you, will be your servant:

(Mark 10:44) 
and whoever will want to be first among you, will be the servant of all.

(Mark 10:45) 
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a redemption for many."

(Mark 10:46) 
And they came to Jericho. And as He was departing from Jericho, and with His disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.

(Mark 10:47) 
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say: "Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me."

(Mark 10:48) 
And many were rebuking him, that he should be quiet: but he cried out much more: "Son of David, have mercy on me."

(Mark 10:49) 
And Jesus standing, ordered him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying to him: "Have confidence: arise, He calls you."

(Mark 10:50) 
Who, casting off his garment, leaping up, came to Him.

(Mark 10:51) 
And answering, Jesus said to him: "What do you want Me to do for you?" The blind man said to Him: "Rabboni, that I may see."

(Mark 10:52) 
And Jesus said to him: "Go your way; your faith has made you safe." And immediately he saw and followed Him in the way.

(Mark 11:1) 
As He approached Jerusalem, and the towns of Bethany and Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,

(Mark 11:2) 
saying to them: “Go into the village which is in front of you. Entering into it right away, you will find a colt tied up. No one has ever ridden on it. Untie it, and bring it.”

(Mark 11:3) 
“If anyone asks you, ‘What are you doing?’ Say that the Lord has need of it, and He will send it back here immediately.”

(Mark 11:4) 
So they went off and found the colt tied up at a door outside, at a fork in the road, and they untied it.

(Mark 11:5) 
Some of those standing there said to them: “What are you doing, untying the colt?”

(Mark 11:6) 
They replied as Jesus had told them to, and they let them go.

(Mark 11:7) 
Then they brought the colt to Jesus. They put their cloaks on it, and He sat upon it.

(Mark 11:8) 
And many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut down branches from the trees and scattered them on the road.

(Mark 11:9) 
And those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, saying: “Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”

(Mark 11:10) 
“Blessed is the kingdom of our father David, which is coming! Hosanna in the highest!”

(Mark 11:11) 
He entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And after looking around at everything, since it was already late in the day, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.

(Mark 11:12) 
On the next day, as they were leaving Bethany, He became hungry.

(Mark 11:13) 
Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He could find anything on it. When He went up to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.

(Mark 11:14) 
Then He said to it: “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And His disciples heard it.

(Mark 11:15) 
And they went to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those selling and buying in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.

(Mark 11:16) 
He would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.

(Mark 11:17) 
And He taught them, saying to them: “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of thieves.”

(Mark 11:18) 
The scribes and chief priests heard this and began looking for a way to kill Him, for they were afraid of Him, because all the people were amazed by His teaching.

(Mark 11:19) 
When evening came, He went out of the city.

(Mark 11:20) 
And as they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.

(Mark 11:21) 
Then Peter, remembering, said to Him: “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has dried up.”

(Mark 11:22) 
And Jesus answered, saying to them: “Have faith in God.”

(Mark 11:23) 
“Truly, I say to you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.

(Mark 11:24) 
“Therefore I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

(Mark 11:25) 
“And whenever you stand praying, forgive anything you have against anyone, so that your Father in the universe may also forgive you your sins.”

(Mark 11:26) 
“But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the universe forgive your sins.”

(Mark 11:27) 
And again they came to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him,

(Mark 11:28) 
and they were saying to Him: “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?”

(Mark 11:29) 
Jesus answered them, “I will ask you one question, and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

(Mark 11:30) 
“Was the baptism of John from the universe, or from men? Answer Me.”

(Mark 11:31) 
And they were reasoning among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From the universe,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’”

(Mark 11:32) 
“But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people, for they all consider John to have been a true prophet.”

(Mark 11:33) 
So they answered Jesus, saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus answered them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Mark 12:1) 
And He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it, and dug a pit, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers, and went away on a journey.

(Mark 12:2) 
And when the harvest season came, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect the fruit of the vineyard.

(Mark 12:3) 
And seizing the servant, they beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

(Mark 12:4) 
And he sent to them again another servant, and him they wounded in the head, and treated shamefully.

(Mark 12:5) 
Then he sent another one, and him they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat, and some they killed.

(Mark 12:6) 
He still had one beloved son. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, ‘Surely they will respect my son.’

(Mark 12:7) 
But those farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’

(Mark 12:8) 
And seizing him, they killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

(Mark 12:9) 
What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.

(Mark 12:10) 
Have you not read this scripture: ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.

(Mark 12:11) 
This was done by the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes’?

(Mark 12:12) 
And they sought to seize Him, but they feared the crowds, for they knew that He had spoken the parable to them. And leaving Him, they went away.

(Mark 12:13) 
And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch Him in His speech.

(Mark 12:14) 
And when they were come, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and care for no one; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or shall we not pay?”

(Mark 12:15) 
But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why are you tempting me? Bring me a denarius that I may see it.”

(Mark 12:16) 
And they brought it. And He said to them, “Whose is this image and inscription?” They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”

(Mark 12:17) 
And Jesus answering, said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were astonished at Him.

(Mark 12:18) 
And there came to Him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they were questioning Him, saying:

(Mark 12:19) 
“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for his brother.

(Mark 12:20) 
There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and died without leaving children.

(Mark 12:21) 
And the second took her, and died, and neither did he leave children. And the third in like manner.

(Mark 12:22) 
And the seven took her, and left no seed. Last of all, the woman died also.

(Mark 12:23) 
In the resurrection, therefore, when they rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”

(Mark 12:24) 
And Jesus answering, said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

(Mark 12:25) 
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in the heavens.

(Mark 12:26) 
And as for the dead, that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying:

(Mark 12:27) 
‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you are much mistaken.”

(Mark 12:28) 
And one of the scribes, who had heard them disputing, and seeing that He had answered them well, asked Him: “Which commandment is the first of all?”

(Mark 12:29) 
And Jesus answered him: “The first is: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

(Mark 12:30) 
‘And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment.

(Mark 12:31) 
And the second is like this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”

(Mark 12:32) 
And the scribe said to Him: “Well, Teacher, you have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but Him:

(Mark 12:33) 
‘And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is greater than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

(Mark 12:34) 
And Jesus, seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to question Him anymore.

(Mark 12:35) 
And Jesus, answering, said, while teaching in the temple: “How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?

(Mark 12:36) 
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.’

(Mark 12:37) 
David himself calls Him ‘Lord.’ How is He then his son?”

(Mark 12:38) 
And the great multitude listened to Him with pleasure.

(Mark 12:39) 
And in His teaching He was saying: “Beware of the scribes, who wish to walk in long robes, and to be greeted in the marketplace,

(Mark 12:40) 
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first places at feasts.

(Mark 12:41) 
They devour the houses of widows under the guise of long prayers. These will receive a more severe judgment.”

(Mark 12:42) 
And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched how the crowd was casting money into the treasury. And many rich people were throwing in much.

(Mark 12:43) 
And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a farthing.

(Mark 12:44) 
And calling His disciples to Him, He said to them: “Amen I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who have cast into the treasury.

(Mark 12:45) 
For they all put in out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in all that she had, even her whole living.”

(Mark 13:1) 
As He left the temple, one of His disciples said, “Teacher, look at the enormous stones and impressive buildings!”

(Mark 13:2) 
Jesus answered, “Do you see these great buildings? Not a stone will be left upon a stone; all will be torn down.”

(Mark 13:3) 
As He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately:

(Mark 13:4) 
“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to be fulfilled?”

(Mark 13:5) 
Jesus began to say to them: “Be careful that no one deceives you.

(Mark 13:6) 
For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and they will deceive many.

(Mark 13:7) 
And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; for such things must happen, but the end is not yet.

(Mark 13:8) 
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pangs.

(Mark 13:9) 
“But be careful yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.

(Mark 13:10) 
And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.

(Mark 13:11) 
And when they deliver you and bring you to trial, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you at that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

(Mark 13:12) 
And brother will deliver brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.

(Mark 13:13) 
And you will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.

(Mark 13:14) 
“But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.

(Mark 13:15) 
Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter the house to take anything out.

(Mark 13:16) 
And let the one who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak.

(Mark 13:17) 
“But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!

(Mark 13:18) 
Pray that it may not happen in the winter.

(Mark 13:19) 
“For those days will be a time of tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will occur.

(Mark 13:20) 
“And unless the Lord shortened those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.

(Mark 13:21) 
“And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘Behold, He is there,’ do not believe it.

(Mark 13:22) 
For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.

(Mark 13:23) 
“But be on your guard; I have told you everything beforehand.

(Mark 13:24) 
“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,

(Mark 13:25) 
and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

(Mark 13:26) 
“And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.

(Mark 13:27) 
“And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.

(Mark 13:28) 
“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.

(Mark 13:29) 
“So also you, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the doors.

(Mark 13:30) 
“Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.

(Mark 13:31) 
“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

(Mark 13:32) 
“But of that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.

(Mark 13:33) 
“Be on the alert, keep awake, and pray; for you do not know when the time will come.

(Mark 13:34) 
“It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house and putting his servants in charge, assigning to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay awake.

(Mark 13:35) 
“Therefore, be on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at the rooster’s crowing, or in the morning—

(Mark 13:36) 
lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.

(Mark 13:37) 
“What I say to you I say to all: ‘Be on the alert!’”

(Mark 14:1) 
The Passover and Unleavened Bread were coming in two days. The chief priests and scribes sought how to seize Jesus by treachery and kill Him.

(Mark 14:2) 
They said, “Not during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”

(Mark 14:3) 
Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, and as He reclined at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of very costly ointment of pure nard. Breaking the flask, she poured the ointment over His head.

(Mark 14:4) 
Some were indignant within themselves and said, “Why was this waste of ointment made?

(Mark 14:5) 
It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they were angry at her.

(Mark 14:6) 
Jesus said, “Let her alone! Why do you bother her? She has done a good work for Me.

(Mark 14:7) 
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them. But you do not always have Me.

(Mark 14:8) 
She has done what she could; she has beforehand anointed My body for burial.

(Mark 14:9) 
Amen, I say to you, wherever the Gospel is proclaimed throughout the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”

(Mark 14:10) 
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to hand Jesus over to them.

(Mark 14:11) 
They were pleased when they heard this and promised to give him money. And he sought how to betray Him at a convenient time.

(Mark 14:12) 
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, His disciples said to Him, “Where do you want us to go to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”

(Mark 14:13) 
He sent two of His disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.

(Mark 14:14) 
Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’

(Mark 14:15) 
Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Prepare for us there.”

(Mark 14:16) 
The disciples went out and came to the city and found everything as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Mark 14:17) 
When it was evening, He came with the Twelve.

(Mark 14:18) 
As they reclined and were eating, Jesus said, “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray Me, the one eating with Me.”

(Mark 14:19) 
They began to be sorrowful and to say to Him one by one, “Surely not I?”

(Mark 14:20) 
He said to them in reply, “One of the Twelve, the one who dips his hand into the dish with Me.

(Mark 14:21) 
The Son of Man goes as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”

(Mark 14:22) 
While they were eating, He took bread, said the blessing, broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take this, this is My body.”

(Mark 14:23) 
Then He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.

(Mark 14:24) 
He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many.

(Mark 14:25) 
Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”

(Mark 14:26) 
Then, after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

(Mark 14:27) 
Jesus said to them, “You will all have your faith shaken, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’

(Mark 14:28) 
But after I am raised up, I shall go before you to Galilee.”

(Mark 14:29) 
Peter said to Him, “Even though all should have their faith shaken, I will not.”

(Mark 14:30) 
Jesus said to him, “Amen, I say to you, this very night before the cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”

(Mark 14:31) 
But he vehemently protested, “Even though I should have to die with You, I will not deny You.” And they all spoke similarly.

(Mark 14:32) 
They came to a place named Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”

(Mark 14:33) 
He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be troubled and distressed.

(Mark 14:34) 
He said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch.”

(Mark 14:35) 
He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him.

(Mark 14:36) 
He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to You. Take this cup away from Me, but not what I will, but what You will.”

(Mark 14:37) 
Then He returned and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?

(Mark 14:38) 
Keep watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

(Mark 14:39) 
Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.

(Mark 14:40) 
Again He returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what to answer Him.

(Mark 14:41) 
He returned a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is over. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.

(Mark 14:42) 
Get up, let us go. See, My betrayer is near.”

(Mark 14:43) 
Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.

(Mark 14:44) 
The one who was to hand Him over had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I shall kiss is the one; seize him and lead him away securely.”

(Mark 14:45) 
And when he came, he immediately went up to Him and said, “Rabbi,” and kissed Him.

(Mark 14:46) 
Then they laid hands on Him.

(Mark 14:47) 
One of the bystanders drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

(Mark 14:48) 
Jesus said to them in reply, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to seize Me?

(Mark 14:49) 
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest Me; but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.”

(Mark 14:50) 
And they all left Him and fled.

(Mark 14:51) 
Now a young man followed Him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They tried to seize him,

(Mark 14:52) 
but he left the linen cloth behind and ran off naked.

(Mark 14:53) 
They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.

(Mark 14:54) 
Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the high priest's courtyard, where he sat with the guards and warmed himself by the fire.

(Mark 14:55) 
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus so they could put Him to death, but they found none.

(Mark 14:56) 
Many gave false testimony against Him, but their testimonies did not agree.

(Mark 14:57) 
Some began to give false testimony against Him, saying,

(Mark 14:58) 
“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.’”

(Mark 14:59) 
But not even so did their testimony agree.

(Mark 14:60) 
The high priest rose before them and questioned Jesus, saying, “Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?”

(Mark 14:61) 
But He remained silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”

(Mark 14:62) 
Jesus said, “I AM; and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of the sky.”

(Mark 14:63) 
The high priest tore his garments and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?

(Mark 14:64) 
You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned Him as deserving to die.

(Mark 14:65) 
Some began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him and began to beat Him, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!”

(Mark 14:66) 
The guards also took Him and beat Him.

(Mark 14:67) 
While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s maids came.

(Mark 14:68) 
Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You too were with Jesus of Nazareth.”

(Mark 14:69) 
But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are saying.” And he went out to the forecourt, and the cock crowed.

(Mark 14:70) 
The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”

(Mark 14:71) 
He again denied it. After a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.”

(Mark 14:72) 
He began to curse and to swear, “I do not know this man about whom you are speaking.”

(Mark 14:73) 
Immediately the cock crowed a second time. Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.

(Mark 15:1) 
Early in the morning, the high priests, elders, scribes, and the entire council made a plan. They bound Jesus, brought Him, and handed Him over to Pilate.

(Mark 15:2) 
Pilate questioned Him, asking: “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied: “You say so.”

(Mark 15:3) 
And many accused Him of many things.

(Mark 15:4) 
Pilate questioned Him again, saying: “Won’t you answer? See how many things they are accusing you of?”

(Mark 15:5) 
But Jesus still did not reply, so Pilate was amazed.

(Mark 15:6) 
Now, it was customary for him to release one prisoner at the feast, whomever they requested.

(Mark 15:7) 
There was a man called Barabbas, who was imprisoned with those who had started a revolt and committed murder during the revolt.

(Mark 15:8) 
The crowd then came up and began to request that he do for them what he always did.

(Mark 15:9) 
Pilate answered them, saying: “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”

(Mark 15:10) 
For he knew that the high priests had handed Him over out of envy.

(Mark 15:11) 
The high priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas for them instead.

(Mark 15:12) 
Pilate answered them again, saying: “Then what do you want me to do with the king of the Jews?”

(Mark 15:13) 
They shouted back: “Crucify him!”

(Mark 15:14) 
Pilate said to them: “Why, what wrong has he done?” But they shouted all the louder: “Crucify him!”

(Mark 15:15) 
Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them and handed Jesus over to be scourged and crucified.

(Mark 15:16) 
The soldiers then brought Him into the courtyard, that is, the praetorium, and called together the entire cohort.

(Mark 15:17) 
They put a purple cloak on Him, and twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on Him.

(Mark 15:18) 
Then they began to salute Him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”

(Mark 15:19) 
And they struck Him on the head with a reed. They spat on Him, and bowing their knees, they worshipped Him.

(Mark 15:20) 
After mocking Him, they took the purple cloak off Him and put His own clothes back on. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.

(Mark 15:21) 
They compelled a certain passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry His cross.

(Mark 15:22) 
They brought Him to the place Golgotha, which means, the place of the skull.

(Mark 15:23) 
They offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He didn’t take it.

(Mark 15:24) 
And they crucified Him, and divided His garments among them, casting lots for them to see what each one would take.

(Mark 15:25) 
It was the third hour when they crucified Him.

(Mark 15:26) 
The inscription of the charge against Him was written: “The King of the Jews.”

(Mark 15:27) 
With Him, they crucified two thieves, one on His right and the other on His left.

(Mark 15:28) 
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And he was counted among the wicked.”

(Mark 15:29) 
Those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,

(Mark 15:30) 
save yourself by coming down from the cross!”

(Mark 15:31) 
In the same way, the high priests mocked Him among themselves with the scribes, saying, “He saved others; He can’t save Himself.”

(Mark 15:32) 
“Let Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe.” Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.

(Mark 15:33) 
When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole earth until the ninth hour.

(Mark 15:34) 
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”

(Mark 15:35) 
Some of the bystanders, hearing this, said: “Look, he’s calling for Elijah.”

(Mark 15:36) 
Someone ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, “Wait! Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”

(Mark 15:37) 
Then Jesus, uttering a loud cry, breathed His last.

(Mark 15:38) 
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

(Mark 15:39) 
When the centurion who stood facing Him saw that He had breathed His last in this way, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.”

(Mark 15:40) 
There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.

(Mark 15:41) 
They had followed Him when He was in Galilee, ministering to Him, and there were many other women who had come up with Him to Jerusalem.

(Mark 15:42) 
When evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,

(Mark 15:43) 
Joseph of Arimathaea, a respected member of the council, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.

(Mark 15:44) 
Pilate was surprised that He was already dead, and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He was already dead.

(Mark 15:45) 
When he learned this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

(Mark 15:46) 
Having bought a linen shroud, Joseph took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

(Mark 15:47) 
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on where He was laid.

(Mark 16:1) 
After the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought perfumed oils, so that when they came to the tomb, they could anoint Jesus.

(Mark 16:2) 
And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb. The sun had just risen.

(Mark 16:3) 
And they were saying to one another: "Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?"

(Mark 16:4) 
But looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was very large.

(Mark 16:5) 
And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a white robe, and they were astonished.

(Mark 16:6) 
The young man said to them: "Do not be terrified. You are seeking Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.

(Mark 16:7) 
But go, tell His disciples and Peter, that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you."

(Mark 16:8) 
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and fear had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

(Mark 16:9) 
Now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.

(Mark 16:10) 
She went and announced the news to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.

(Mark 16:11) 
And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.

(Mark 16:12) 
After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking to the country.

(Mark 16:13) 
And they went and told the others, and they did not believe them.

(Mark 16:14) 
Finally, as they were reclining at table, He appeared to the eleven. And He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen.

(Mark 16:15) 
And He said to them: "Go into the entire world and preach the Gospel to every creature.

(Mark 16:16) 
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

(Mark 16:17) 
And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;

(Mark 16:18) 
they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."

(Mark 16:19) 
So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into the sky and sat at the right hand of God.

(Mark 16:20) 
And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.

(Luke 1:1) 
Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,

(Luke 1:2) 
as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.

(Luke 1:3) 
Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,

(Luke 1:4) 
so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.

(Luke 1:5) 
In the time of Herod king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and his wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

(Luke 1:6) 
Both of them were righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.

(Luke 1:7) 
But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years.

(Luke 1:8) 
Once when Zechariah was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,

(Luke 1:9) 
according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.

(Luke 1:10) 
And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.

(Luke 1:11) 
Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

(Luke 1:12) 
When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.

(Luke 1:13) 
But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.

(Luke 1:14) 
And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,

(Luke 1:15) 
because he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.

(Luke 1:16) 
And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.

(Luke 1:17) 
And he will go on before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of parents to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”

(Luke 1:18) 
And Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”

(Luke 1:19) 
And the angel answering said to him: “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you this good news.

(Luke 1:20) 
And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”

(Luke 1:21) 
And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple.

(Luke 1:22) 
When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute.

(Luke 1:23) 
And it came to pass that, as soon as the days of his service were completed, he departed to his own house.

(Luke 1:24) 
After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,

(Luke 1:25) 
“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.”

(Luke 1:26) 
In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,

(Luke 1:27) 
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

(Luke 1:28) 
And the angel came to her and said, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you.” Blessed are you among women.

(Luke 1:29) 
But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what sort of greeting this might be.

(Luke 1:30) 
Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.

(Luke 1:31) 
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus.

(Luke 1:32) 
He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David,

(Luke 1:33) 
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”

(Luke 1:34) 
And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I do not know a man?”

(Luke 1:35) 
And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy—he will be called the Son of God.

(Luke 1:36) 
And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.

(Luke 1:37) 
For nothing will be impossible with God.”

(Luke 1:38) 
And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

(Luke 1:39) 
In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,

(Luke 1:40) 
and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.

(Luke 1:41) 
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,

(Luke 1:42) 
and she cried out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

(Luke 1:43) 
And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

(Luke 1:44) 
For behold, as soon as the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.

(Luke 1:45) 
And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

(Luke 1:46) 
And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,

(Luke 1:47) 
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,

(Luke 1:48) 
for He has looked on the humble estate of His servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed;

(Luke 1:49) 
for He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.

(Luke 1:50) 
And His mercy is for those who fear Him from generation to generation.

(Luke 1:51) 
He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,

(Luke 1:52) 
He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and has exalted those of humble estate;

(Luke 1:53) 
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.

(Luke 1:54) 
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,

(Luke 1:55) 
as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his offspring forever.”

(Luke 1:56) 
And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.

(Luke 1:57) 
Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.

(Luke 1:58) 
And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.

(Luke 1:59) 
And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him by the name of his father Zechariah,

(Luke 1:60) 
and his mother answered, “No; he shall be called John.”

(Luke 1:61) 
And they said to her, “But there is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”

(Luke 1:62) 
And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called.

(Luke 1:63) 
And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they all marveled.

(Luke 1:64) 
And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.

(Luke 1:65) 
And fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.

(Luke 1:66) 
And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was with him.

(Luke 1:67) 
And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,

(Luke 1:68) 
“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people

(Luke 1:69) 
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,

(Luke 1:70) 
as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old,

(Luke 1:71) 
that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;

(Luke 1:72) 
to show mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,

(Luke 1:73) 
the oath that He swore to our father Abraham, to grant us

(Luke 1:74) 
that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,

(Luke 1:75) 
in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.

(Luke 1:76) 
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,

(Luke 1:77) 
to give knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness of their sins,

(Luke 1:78) 
because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high

(Luke 1:79) 
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”

(Luke 1:80) 
And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his appearing to Israel.

(Luke 2:1) 
In those days, Caesar Augustus gave a decree for a census to be taken of the entire world.

(Luke 2:2) 
This first census took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.

(Luke 2:3) 
And everyone went to be registered, each person to their own city.

(Luke 2:4) 
So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David, called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,

(Luke 2:5) 
to be registered with Mary, his espoused wife, who was pregnant.

(Luke 2:6) 
And it came to pass that, while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth.

(Luke 2:7) 
She brought forth her firstborn Son, wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

(Luke 2:8) 
And there were shepherds in the same region, keeping watch and guarding the night over their flock.

(Luke 2:9) 
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to them, and the glory of God shone round about them, and they were greatly afraid.

(Luke 2:10) 
Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:

(Luke 2:11) 
For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

(Luke 2:12) 
And this is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.”

(Luke 2:13) 
And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

(Luke 2:14) 
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those He favors.”

(Luke 2:15) 
And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”

(Luke 2:16) 
And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.

(Luke 2:17) 
When they had seen, they made known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.

(Luke 2:18) 
And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.

(Luke 2:19) 
But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.

(Luke 2:20) 
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it was told them.

(Luke 2:21) 
And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising the Child, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

(Luke 2:22) 
And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord,

(Luke 2:23) 
(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord,”)

(Luke 2:24) 
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”

(Luke 2:25) 
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

(Luke 2:26) 
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

(Luke 2:27) 
And he came in the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for Him according to the custom of the Law,

(Luke 2:28) 
he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:

(Luke 2:29) 
“Now, Lord, You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;

(Luke 2:30) 
For my eyes have seen Your salvation

(Luke 2:31) 
Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,

(Luke 2:32) 
A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.”

(Luke 2:33) 
And his father and mother were marveling at the things spoken concerning Him.

(Luke 2:34) 
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against

(Luke 2:35) 
and a sword will pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

(Luke 2:36) 
And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,

(Luke 2:37) 
and then as a widow until she was eighty-four years old. She did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.

(Luke 2:38) 
And coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to God and spoke of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

(Luke 2:39) 
And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.

(Luke 2:40) 
And the Child continued to grow and become strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon Him.

(Luke 2:41) 
Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.

(Luke 2:42) 
And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast,

(Luke 2:43) 
and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, but His parents did not know it.

(Luke 2:44) 
Assuming Him to be in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, and they began looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.

(Luke 2:45) 
When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for Him.

(Luke 2:46) 
After three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.

(Luke 2:47) 
And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.

(Luke 2:48) 
When they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You.”

(Luke 2:49) 
And He said to them, “Why were you looking for Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?”

(Luke 2:50) 
But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.

(Luke 2:51) 
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, and His mother kept all these things in her heart.

(Luke 2:52) 
And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

(Luke 3:1) 
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,

(Luke 3:2) 
during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the desert.

(Luke 3:3) 
And he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

(Luke 3:4) 
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "The voice of one crying in the desert: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'

(Luke 3:5) 
'Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth.'

(Luke 3:6) 
'And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'

(Luke 3:7) 
He therefore said to the crowds that went out to be baptized by him: "Offspring of vipers, who has shown you how to flee from the wrath to come?

(Luke 3:8) 
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and do not begin to say, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I tell you that God is able, even from these stones, to raise up children to Abraham.

(Luke 3:9) 
For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

(Luke 3:10) 
And the crowds were questioning him, saying: "What then should we do?

(Luke 3:11) 
And he answering, said to them: "He that has two coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do in like manner.

(Luke 3:12) 
And the publicans also came to be baptized; and they said to him: "Master, what shall we do?

(Luke 3:13) 
But he said to them: "Do nothing more than that which is appointed to you.

(Luke 3:14) 
And the soldiers also questioned him, saying: "And we, what shall we do?" And he said to them: "Do violence to no one, nor accuse anyone falsely; and be content with your pay.

(Luke 3:15) 
Now as the people were in expectation, and all were thinking in their hearts of John, if perhaps he were Christ,

(Luke 3:16) 
John, answering, said to them all: "I indeed baptize you with water; but there shall come one mightier than I, the strap of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

(Luke 3:17) 
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

(Luke 3:18) 
And many other things, exhorting, he preached to the people.

(Luke 3:19) 
But Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evils that Herod had done,

(Luke 3:20) 
added this also above all, and shut up John in prison.

(Luke 3:21) 
Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened;

(Luke 3:22) 
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him; and a voice came from heaven: "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

(Luke 3:23) 
And Jesus himself was beginning about thirty years old, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was of Heli,

(Luke 3:24) 
who was of Matthath, who was of Levi, who was of Melchi, who was of Janna, who was of Joseph,

(Luke 3:25) 
who was of Mattathias, who was of Amos, who was of Nahum, who was of Esli, who was of Naggae,

(Luke 3:26) 
who was of Maath, who was of Mattathias, who was of Semei, who was of Josech, who was of Joda,

(Luke 3:27) 
who was of Joannan, who was of Rhesa, who was of Zorobabel, who was of Salaathiel, who was of Neri,

(Luke 3:28) 
who was of Melchi, who was of Addi, who was of Chosam, who was of Elmodam, who was of Her,

(Luke 3:29) 
who was of Jose, who was of Eliezer, who was of Jorim, who was of Matthath, who was of Levi,

(Luke 3:30) 
who was of Simeon, who was of Juda, who was of Joseph, who was of Jona, who was of Eliachim,

(Luke 3:31) 
who was of Melea, who was of Menna, who was of Matthata, who was of Nathan, who was of David,

(Luke 3:32) 
who was of Isai, who was of Obed, who was of Booz, who was of Sela, who was of Aram,

(Luke 3:33) 
who was of Aminadab, who was of Admin, who was of Arni, who was of Esrom, who was of Phares, who was of Juda,

(Luke 3:34) 
who was of Jacob, who was of Isaac, who was of Abraham, who was of Thare, who was of Nachor,

(Luke 3:35) 
who was of Seruch, who was of Ragau, who was of Phalec, who was of Heber, who was of Sale,

(Luke 3:36) 
who was of Cainan, who was of Arphaxad, who was of Sem, who was of Noe, who was of Lamech,

(Luke 3:37) 
who was of Matusala, who was of Enoch, who was of Jared, who was of Malaleel, who was of Cainan,

(Luke 3:38) 
who was of Enos, who was of Seth, who was of Adam, who was of God.

(Luke 4:1) 
Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desert.

(Luke 4:2) 
There, He was tested by the Devil for forty days. And during those days, He ate nothing. When those days were over, He was hungry.

(Luke 4:3) 
The Devil said to Him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."

(Luke 4:4) 
Jesus answered him, "It is written: ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’"

(Luke 4:5) 
Then the Devil led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.

(Luke 4:6) 
And the Devil said to Him, "To you I will give all this power and their glory, because it has been given to me, and I give it to whomever I wish."

(Luke 4:7) 
If you worship me, then all shall be yours."

(Luke 4:8) 
Jesus answered him, "It is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.’"

(Luke 4:9) 
Then he brought Him to Jerusalem and placed Him on the highest part of the Temple, and said to Him, "If you are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;

(Luke 4:10) 
for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you;’

(Luke 4:11) 
and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.’"

(Luke 4:12) 
And Jesus answering, said to him, "It is said: ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’"

(Luke 4:13) 
When the Devil had finished every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.

(Luke 4:14) 
Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about Him went out through all the surrounding region.

(Luke 4:15) 
And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

(Luke 4:16) 
He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And, as was His custom, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.

(Luke 4:17) 
And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. When He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:

(Luke 4:18) 
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,

(Luke 4:19) 
to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

(Luke 4:20) 
Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of all those in the synagogue were fixed on Him.

(Luke 4:21) 
And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”

(Luke 4:22) 
And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the gracious words that proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, “Is this not the son of Joseph?”

(Luke 4:23) 
And He said to them, "You will surely quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.’"

(Luke 4:24) 
And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.

(Luke 4:25) 
But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, and when great famine was throughout all the land;

(Luke 4:26) 
and Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.

(Luke 4:27) 
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."

(Luke 4:28) 
And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath.

(Luke 4:29) 
Then they rose up and thrust Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw Him down headlong.

(Luke 4:30) 
But He, passing through their midst, went His way.

(Luke 4:31) 
Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.

(Luke 4:32) 
And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.

(Luke 4:33) 
Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,

(Luke 4:34) 
saying, “Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are—the Holy One of God!”

(Luke 4:35) 
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out of him, without hurting him.

(Luke 4:36) 
Then they were all amazed, and they spoke among themselves, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.”

(Luke 4:37) 
And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.

(Luke 4:38) 
Then He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s wife’s mother was ill with a high fever, and they made request of Him concerning her.

(Luke 4:39) 
So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.

(Luke 4:40) 
When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him. And He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.

(Luke 4:41) 
And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And rebuking them, He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.

(Luke 4:42) 
Now when day came, He departed and went into a desolate place. And the crowds were looking for Him, and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from going away from them;

(Luke 4:43) 
but He said to them, “I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this reason I have been sent."

(Luke 4:44) 
And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

(Luke 5:1) 
It came to pass that when the crowds pressed in on Him, wanting to hear the Word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.

(Luke 5:2) 
He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.

(Luke 5:3) 
And He, entering into one of the boats, which was Simon's, asked him to move the boat a little from the land. And, sitting down, He taught the crowds from the boat.

(Luke 5:4) 
When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”

(Luke 5:5) 
And Simon answering, said to Him: “Master, we have toiled all night and taken nothing; but at your word, I will let down the net.”

(Luke 5:6) 
And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish, and their nets were breaking.

(Luke 5:7) 
And they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they were almost sinking.

(Luke 5:8) 
Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying: “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.”

(Luke 5:9) 
For he was astonished, and all who were with him, at the catch of the fish that they had taken.

(Luke 5:10) 
And so also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men.”

(Luke 5:11) 
And when they had brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.

(Luke 5:12) 
And it came to pass that when He was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy; and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and besought Him, saying: “Lord, if You will, You can make me clean.”

(Luke 5:13) 
And extending His hand, He touched him, saying: “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him.

(Luke 5:14) 
And He charged him to tell no one, but “Go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”

(Luke 5:15) 
But so much the more the report about Him spread, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.

(Luke 5:16) 
But He was withdrawing to the deserts and praying.

(Luke 5:17) 
And it came to pass on one of those days, that He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

(Luke 5:18) 
And behold, men were carrying a man on a bed who was paralyzed; and they were seeking to bring him in and to set him before Him.

(Luke 5:19) 
And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went upon the housetop, and let him down with the bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.

(Luke 5:20) 
When He saw their faith, He said: “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”

(Luke 5:21) 
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying: “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”

(Luke 5:22) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, answering, said to them: “What do you question in your hearts?

(Luke 5:23) 
Which is easier, to say: ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say: ‘Rise and walk’?

(Luke 5:24) 
But that you may know that the Son of Man has the power on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic: “I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”

(Luke 5:25) 
And immediately rising up before them, and taking up the bed on which he was lying, he went to his own house, glorifying God.

(Luke 5:26) 
And amazement took hold of all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying: “We have seen wonderful things today.”

(Luke 5:27) 
And after these things, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and He said to him: “Follow Me.”

(Luke 5:28) 
And leaving everything, he arose and followed Him.

(Luke 5:29) 
And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.

(Luke 5:30) 
And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against His disciples, saying: “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”

(Luke 5:31) 
And Jesus answering, said to them: “Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick.”

(Luke 5:32) 
“I have not come to call the just, but sinners to repentance.”

(Luke 5:33) 
And they said to Him: “The disciples of John fast often and make supplications; likewise, the Pharisees do; but Yours eat and drink.”

(Luke 5:34) 
To whom Jesus said: “Can you make the sons of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?

(Luke 5:35) 
“But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.”

(Luke 5:36) 
He spoke also a parable to them: “No one puts a piece from a new garment onto an old garment; otherwise, the new will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.”

(Luke 5:37) 
“And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.

(Luke 5:38) 
“But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins; then both are preserved.”

(Luke 5:39) 
And no one, drinking the old, wants the new immediately; for he says, ‘The old is better.’”

(Luke 6:1) 
One Sabbath day, Jesus went out through a field of grain. His disciples began to pluck some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.

(Luke 6:2) 
Some Pharisees said, “Why are you doing things that are not allowed on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 6:3) 
Jesus answered, “Haven’t you read about how David and those who were with him did when they were hungry?

(Luke 6:4) 
He went into God’s house, and took the bread offered to God, and ate it, and gave it to his companions. He was not permitted to eat this bread because it was only for the priests.

(Luke 6:5) 
Then He told them, “The Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.”

(Luke 6:6) 
On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach. There was a man there whose right hand was shriveled.

(Luke 6:7) 
The scribes and the Pharisees watched Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so they could accuse Him.

(Luke 6:8) 
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Get up and stand in the middle.” He got up and stood there.

(Luke 6:9) 
Jesus then said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save a life, or to destroy it?”

(Luke 6:10) 
Then He looked around at everyone. He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored.

(Luke 6:11) 
But they were filled with rage, and began to talk about what they should do to Jesus.

(Luke 6:12) 
In these days, Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God.

(Luke 6:13) 
When the sun rose, He called His disciples and chose twelve of them, whom He also named Apostles.

(Luke 6:14) 
Simon, whom He named Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

(Luke 6:15) 
Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon, who is called the Zealot,

(Luke 6:16) 
Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was a traitor.

(Luke 6:17) 
He came down with them and stood on a level place, and a large crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.

(Luke 6:18) 
They had come to hear Him and be healed of their diseases. Those tormented by evil spirits were cured.

(Luke 6:19) 
And all the crowd were trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him that was healing everyone.

(Luke 6:20) 
Then Jesus looked at His disciples and said: “Blessed are you who are poor, because yours is the kingdom of God.

(Luke 6:21) 
Blessed are you who hunger now, because you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, because you will laugh.

(Luke 6:22) 
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you, and reject your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man.

(Luke 6:23) 
Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, because your reward is great in the universe. Their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.

(Luke 6:24) 
But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your consolation.

(Luke 6:25) 
Woe to you who are full now, because you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep.

(Luke 6:26) 
Woe to you when all speak well of you, for their ancestors treated the false prophets in the same way.

(Luke 6:27) 
But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you.

(Luke 6:28) 
Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.

(Luke 6:29) 
To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also. From the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.

(Luke 6:30) 
Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your belongings back from the one who takes them away.

(Luke 6:31) 
And as you want people to do to you, do the same to them.

(Luke 6:32) 
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.

(Luke 6:33) 
If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.

(Luke 6:34) 
And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount.

(Luke 6:35) 
But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, for He is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.

(Luke 6:36) 
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

(Luke 6:37) 
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

(Luke 6:38) 
Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”

(Luke 6:39) 
He also told them this parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?

(Luke 6:40) 
A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

(Luke 6:41) 
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?

(Luke 6:42) 
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first remove the log from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye.

(Luke 6:43) 
For no good tree produces bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.

(Luke 6:44) 
Each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.

(Luke 6:45) 
The good person brings forth good things from the good treasury of his heart, and the evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasury. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

(Luke 6:46) 
“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

(Luke 6:47) 
I will show you what someone is like who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them.

(Luke 6:48) 
That person is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. When a flood came, the river beat against that house, but it could not shake it, because it was well built.

(Luke 6:49) 
But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river beat against it, the house immediately fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”

(Luke 7:1) 
When Jesus finished speaking to the people, he went into Capernaum.

(Luke 7:2) 
A centurion's servant was very ill and near death—he was very dear to the centurion.

(Luke 7:3) 
When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to beg him to come and heal his servant.

(Luke 7:4) 
When they came to Jesus, they earnestly pleaded with him, saying, “This man deserves your help,

(Luke 7:5) 
because he loves our people, and he built our synagogue.”

(Luke 7:6) 
So Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter my home,

(Luke 7:7) 
and that is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. Just give the order, and my servant will be healed.

(Luke 7:8) 
For I myself am a man subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

(Luke 7:9) 
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to the crowd following him, “I tell you, I have not found such faith even in Israel.”

(Luke 7:10) 
And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.

(Luke 7:11) 
Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.

(Luke 7:12) 
As he approached the gate of the town, a dead man was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her.

(Luke 7:13) 
When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her, and he said, “Do not weep.”

(Luke 7:14) 
Then he went up and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”

(Luke 7:15) 
The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.

(Luke 7:16) 
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and, “God has come to help his people.”

(Luke 7:17) 
This news about him spread throughout Judea and the surrounding area.

(Luke 7:18) 
John’s disciples told him about all these things.

(Luke 7:19) 
Calling two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”

(Luke 7:20) 
When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”

(Luke 7:21) 
At that very time Jesus cured many who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons; and he granted sight to many who were blind.

(Luke 7:22) 
So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.

(Luke 7:23) 
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”

(Luke 7:24) 
After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

(Luke 7:25) 
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in royal palaces.

(Luke 7:26) 
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

(Luke 7:27) 
This is the one about whom it is written: ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’

(Luke 7:28) 
I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”

(Luke 7:29) 
All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard this, acknowledged that God was in the right, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.

(Luke 7:30) 
But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.

(Luke 7:31) 
To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?

(Luke 7:32) 
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’

(Luke 7:33) 
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’

(Luke 7:34) 
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’

(Luke 7:35) 
But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”

(Luke 7:36) 
Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.

(Luke 7:37) 
A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came with a jar of expensive perfume.

(Luke 7:38) 
As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.

(Luke 7:39) 
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”

(Luke 7:40) 
Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, teacher,” he said.

(Luke 7:41) 
“Two people owed money to a certain money lender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

(Luke 7:42) 
Neither of them could pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”

(Luke 7:43) 
Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.

(Luke 7:44) 
Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

(Luke 7:45) 
You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.

(Luke 7:46) 
You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.

(Luke 7:47) 
Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”

(Luke 7:48) 
Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

(Luke 7:49) 
The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

(Luke 7:50) 
Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”

(Luke 8:1) 
After this, Jesus Christ traveled through the cities and villages, preaching and proclaiming the Kingdom of God; and the twelve apostles were with Him,

(Luke 8:2) 
and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,

(Luke 8:3) 
and Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them from their resources.

(Luke 8:4) 
And when a very large crowd was gathering, and people were coming to Him from every city, He said this parable:

(Luke 8:5) 
“A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell beside the way and was trodden down, and the birds of the sky ate it up.

(Luke 8:6) 
“And some fell on the rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it had no moisture.

(Luke 8:7) 
“And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.

(Luke 8:8) 
“And some fell on the good ground, and sprang up, and produced a hundredfold.” As He said these things, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Luke 8:9) 
Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant.

(Luke 8:10) 
And He said, “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to the rest, it is in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

(Luke 8:11) 
“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

(Luke 8:12) 
“Those by the way are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.

(Luke 8:13) 
“Those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.

(Luke 8:14) 
“And what fell among the thorns are those who have heard, and as they go, are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit.

(Luke 8:15) 
“But what fell on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, having heard the word, keep it and bear fruit with patience.

(Luke 8:16) 
“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

(Luke 8:17) 
“For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.

(Luke 8:18) 
“Take heed therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”

(Luke 8:19) 
Then His mother and brothers came to Him, but they could not get to Him because of the crowd.

(Luke 8:20) 
And it was told Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.”

(Luke 8:21) 
But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”

(Luke 8:22) 
Now it happened on a certain day that He got into a boat with His disciples, and He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they launched out.

(Luke 8:23) 
But as they sailed, He fell asleep; and a tempest of wind descended on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.

(Luke 8:24) 
And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.

(Luke 8:25) 
But He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they, afraid, marveled, saying to one another, “Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!”

(Luke 8:26) 
Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.

(Luke 8:27) 
And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. He was not wearing clothes, nor did he live in a house, but in the tombs.

(Luke 8:28) 
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!”

(Luke 8:29) 
For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the wilderness.

(Luke 8:30) 
Jesus asked him, saying, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him.

(Luke 8:31) 
And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.

(Luke 8:32) 
Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.

(Luke 8:33) 
Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and were drowned.

(Luke 8:34) 
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.

(Luke 8:35) 
Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.

(Luke 8:36) 
And those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.

(Luke 8:37) 
Then the whole multitude of the region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into a boat and returned.

(Luke 8:38) 
Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,

(Luke 8:39) 
“Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.” And he went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.

(Luke 8:40) 
Now it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.

(Luke 8:41) 
And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to come to his house,

(Luke 8:42) 
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him.

(Luke 8:43) 
Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by anyone,

(Luke 8:44) 
came behind Him and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.

(Luke 8:45) 
And Jesus said, “Who touched Me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’

(Luke 8:46) 
But Jesus said, “Someone touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.”

(Luke 8:47) 
Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.

(Luke 8:48) 
And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”

(Luke 8:49) 
While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.”

(Luke 8:50) 
But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, “Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.”

(Luke 8:51) 
When He came to the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.

(Luke 8:52) 
Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, “Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.”

(Luke 8:53) 
And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.

(Luke 8:54) 
But He, taking her by the hand, called out, saying, “Little girl, arise.”

(Luke 8:55) 
Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.

(Luke 8:56) 
And her parents were astonished, but He commanded them to tell no one what had happened.

(Luke 9:1) 
Then, collecting the twelve Apostles, He gave them power and authority over all demons, to heal sicknesses.

(Luke 9:2) 
And He sent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

(Luke 9:3) 
And He said to them: "Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.

(Luke 9:4) 
And into whatsoever house you shall enter, there abide, and do not depart from there.

(Luke 9:5) 
And whosoever will not receive you, going out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."

(Luke 9:6) 
Going forth, they went about through the towns, preaching the Gospel and healing everywhere.

(Luke 9:7) 
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by Him. And he was in doubt, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead;

(Luke 9:8) 
but by some, that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the prophets of old was risen again.

(Luke 9:9) 
And Herod said: "John I have beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things?" And he sought to see Him.

(Luke 9:10) 
And the Apostles, when they were returned, told Him all they had done. And taking them, He went aside into a desert place, which is called Bethsaida.

(Luke 9:11) 
And when the crowds knew it, they followed Him; and He welcomed them and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God and healed those who had need of healing.

(Luke 9:12) 
But the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to Him: "Send away the crowds, that they may go into the towns and the villages around, and lodge, and find provisions, for here we are in a desert place."

(Luke 9:13) 
But He said to them: "Give them to eat." And they said: "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people."

(Luke 9:14) 
For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples: "Make them sit down by fifties in a company."

(Luke 9:15) 
And they did so, and made them all sit down.

(Luke 9:16) 
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them; and He broke them and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

(Luke 9:17) 
And they all ate and were filled. And there were taken up what remained to them of fragments, twelve baskets.

(Luke 9:18) 
And it came to pass, as He was alone praying, that His disciples were with Him; and He asked them, saying: "Whom do the people say that I am?"

(Luke 9:19) 
But they answering, said: "John the Baptist"; and others say: "Elias"; and others: "That one of the former prophets has risen again."

(Luke 9:20) 
Then He said to them: "But whom do you say that I am?" Peter answering, said: "The Christ of God."

(Luke 9:21) 
But He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one.

(Luke 9:22) 
Saying: "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and rise again on the third day."

(Luke 9:23) 
And He said to all: "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross every day, and follow Me.

(Luke 9:24) 
For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; but he who shall lose his life for My sake, shall save it.

(Luke 9:25) 
For what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but lose himself, and suffer harm?

(Luke 9:26) 
For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed, when He shall come in His majesty and that of the Father and of the holy angels.

(Luke 9:27) 
And I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death, until they see the kingdom of God."

(Luke 9:28) 
And it came to pass after these words, that He took Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray.

(Luke 9:29) 
And it came to pass, as He was praying, that the appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became white and shining.

(Luke 9:30) 
And behold, two men were talking with Him. And they were Moses and Elias,

(Luke 9:31) 
who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His decease that He was to accomplish in Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:32) 
Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And when they were awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.

(Luke 9:33) 
And it came to pass, as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus: "Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elias," not knowing what he said.

(Luke 9:34) 
And as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they were afraid when they entered into the cloud.

(Luke 9:35) 
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: "This is My beloved Son; hear Him."

(Luke 9:36) 
And while the voice was made, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace and told no one in those days any of the things that they had seen.

(Luke 9:37) 
And it came to pass the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a great crowd met Him.

(Luke 9:38) 
And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying: "Master, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child:

(Luke 9:39) 
and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out and convulses him with foaming, and scarcely departs from him, bruising him.

(Luke 9:40) 
And I begged Your disciples to cast him out, and they could not."

(Luke 9:41) 
And Jesus answering, said: "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring your son here."

(Luke 9:42) 
And as he was coming, the devil threw him down and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.

(Luke 9:43) 
And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. But while all were wondering at all the things that He was doing, He said to His disciples:

(Luke 9:44) 
"Let these words sink down into your ears: For it is destined that the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men."

(Luke 9:45) 
But they did not understand this word; and it was hidden from them, so that they should not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask Him about this word.

(Luke 9:46) 
Then a thought arose in them, which of them should be the greater.

(Luke 9:47) 
But Jesus, seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and placed him beside Himself.

(Luke 9:48) 
And He said to them: "Whosoever shall receive this child in My name, receives Me. And whosoever receives Me, receives Him Who sent Me. For he who is the lesser among you all, he is the greater."

(Luke 9:49) 
And John answering, said: "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us."

(Luke 9:50) 
And Jesus said to him: "Do not forbid him; for he who is not against you is for you."

(Luke 9:51) 
And it came to pass, when the days of His assumption were being fulfilled, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:52) 
And He sent messengers before His face; and going in, they entered into a city of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.

(Luke 9:53) 
And they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.

(Luke 9:54) 
And when His disciples James and John saw this, they said: "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"

(Luke 9:55) 
And turning, He rebuked them, saying: "You do not know of what spirit you are."

(Luke 9:56) 
The Son of Man came not to destroy souls, but to save them." And they went into another town.

(Luke 9:57) 
And it came to pass, as they were going on the road, that someone said to Him: "I will follow You wherever You go."

(Luke 9:58) 
And Jesus said to him: "The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."

(Luke 9:59) 
And He said to another: "Follow Me." But he said: "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."

(Luke 9:60) 
And Jesus said to him: "Let the dead bury their dead; but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."

(Luke 9:61) 
And another also said: "I will follow You, Lord; but allow me first to bid farewell to those at home."

(Luke 9:62) 
To whom Jesus said: "No one putting his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God."

(Luke 10:1) 
After these things, the Lord then designated seventy-two others and sent them, two by two, before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to go.

(Luke 10:2) 
He said, therefore, to them: "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that He send laborers into His harvest."

(Luke 10:3) 
Go; behold, I send you as lambs among wolves.

(Luke 10:4) 
Do not carry a bag, nor a satchel, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way.

(Luke 10:5) 
Into whatsoever house you enter, first say: "Peace be to this house."

(Luke 10:6) 
And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.

(Luke 10:7) 
And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things that they have, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.

(Luke 10:8) 
And into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you:

(Luke 10:9) 
And heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'

(Luke 10:10) 
But into whatsoever city you enter, and they do not receive you, going out into the streets of the same, say:

(Luke 10:11) 
Even the dust that has stuck to us from your city we wipe off against you; however, know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.

(Luke 10:12) 
I tell you, that it will be more tolerable for the Sodomites in that day, than for that city.

(Luke 10:13) 
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the powers that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

(Luke 10:14) 
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.

(Luke 10:15) 
And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to hell.

(Luke 10:16) 
He who hears you, hears Me; and he who rejects you, rejects Me; and he who rejects Me, rejects Him who sent Me.

(Luke 10:17) 
And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying: "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."

(Luke 10:18) 
And He said to them: "I saw Satan like lightning falling from the sky.

(Luke 10:19) 
Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall harm you.

(Luke 10:20) 
However, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice more that your names are written in heaven."

(Luke 10:21) 
In that hour, rejoicing in the Spirit, He exclaimed and said: "I confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to little ones. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."

(Luke 10:22) 
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. And no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him."

(Luke 10:23) 
And turning to the disciples, He said: "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

(Luke 10:24) 
For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it; and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it."

(Luke 10:25) 
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, tempting Him, and saying: "Teacher, what must I do to possess eternal life?"

(Luke 10:26) 
And He said to him: "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"

(Luke 10:27) 
He answering said: "You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."

(Luke 10:28) 
And He said to him: "You have answered rightly; do this and you will live."

(Luke 10:29) 
But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus: "And who is my neighbor?"

(Luke 10:30) 
Jesus answering, said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who also, having stripped him and inflicted wounds, departed, leaving him half dead.

(Luke 10:31) 
And it happened that a certain priest was going down the same way; and seeing him, he passed by.

(Luke 10:32) 
And likewise a Levite, when he was near the place, and saw him, passed by.

(Luke 10:33) 
But a certain Samaritan, journeying, came near him; and seeing him, he was moved with compassion.

(Luke 10:34) 
And approaching, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine; and putting him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

(Luke 10:35) 
And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said: 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, I will repay you when I return.'

(Luke 10:36) 
Which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?

(Luke 10:37) 
And he said: "He who showed mercy on him." And Jesus said to him: "Go, and do likewise."

(Luke 10:38) 
Now it came to pass, as they went, that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.

(Luke 10:39) 
And she had a sister named Mary, who also, sitting beside the feet of the Lord, was listening to His Word.

(Luke 10:40) 
But Martha was occupied about much serving. Who stood and said: "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me alone to serve? Tell her, therefore, to help me."

(Luke 10:41) 
And the Lord answering, said to her: "Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and you are troubled about many things;

(Luke 10:42) 
but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her."

(Luke 11:1) 
One day, after Jesus had finished praying, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”

(Luke 11:2) 
He said to them, “When you pray, say: 'Father, may Your name be kept holy. May Your kingdom come.'

(Luke 11:3) 
Give us each day the food we need for that day.

(Luke 11:4) 
And forgive us our sins, as we too forgive all who are in debt to us. And do not lead us into temptation.”

(Luke 11:5) 
Then He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,

(Luke 11:6) 
because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?’

(Luke 11:7) 
And he from within will answer, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’

(Luke 11:8) 
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.

(Luke 11:9) 
So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.

(Luke 11:10) 
For everyone who asks receives; everyone who searches finds; and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.

(Luke 11:11) 
What father among you, if his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake instead of a fish?

(Luke 11:12) 
Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?

(Luke 11:13) 
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

(Luke 11:14) 
Jesus was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute person spoke; and the crowds were amazed.

(Luke 11:15) 
But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.”

(Luke 11:16) 
Others, trying to test Him, asked Him for a sign from heaven.

(Luke 11:17) 
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house will fall.

(Luke 11:18) 
And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.

(Luke 11:19) 
Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

(Luke 11:20) 
But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

(Luke 11:21) 
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his palace, his goods are in peace.

(Luke 11:22) 
But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoils.

(Luke 11:23) 
Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.”

(Luke 11:24) 
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through arid places looking for rest, and finding none it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’

(Luke 11:25) 
And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order.

(Luke 11:26) 
Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.”

(Luke 11:27) 
As He was saying these things, a woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts that nursed You!”

(Luke 11:28) 
But He said, “Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”

(Luke 11:29) 
As the crowds were increasing, He began to say, “This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

(Luke 11:30) 
For just as Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.

(Luke 11:31) 
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here.

(Luke 11:32) 
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, something greater than Jonah is here.

(Luke 11:33) 
“No one, when they have lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

(Luke 11:34) 
The eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sound, your whole body is full of light; but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness.

(Luke 11:35) 
Therefore be careful that the light in you is not darkness.

(Luke 11:36) 
If then your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”

(Luke 11:37) 
While He was speaking, a Pharisee asked Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.

(Luke 11:38) 
The Pharisee was surprised to see that He did not wash before dinner.

(Luke 11:39) 
And the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

(Luke 11:40) 
You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside also?

(Luke 11:41) 
But give as charity the things that are within, and then all things will be clean for you.

(Luke 11:42) 
“But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and you ignore justice and the love of God; these things you should have done, without neglecting the others.

(Luke 11:43) 
Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.

(Luke 11:44) 
Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.”

(Luke 11:45) 
Then one of the lawyers answered Him, “Teacher, in saying these things You insult us too.”

(Luke 11:46) 
And He said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

(Luke 11:47) 
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.

(Luke 11:48) 
So you are witnesses and you approve the deeds of your ancestors, because they killed the prophets and you build their tombs.

(Luke 11:49) 
Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,’

(Luke 11:50) 
so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,

(Luke 11:51) 
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.

(Luke 11:52) 
“Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and those who were entering you hindered.”

(Luke 11:53) 
As He went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press Him hard and to provoke Him to speak about many things,

(Luke 11:54) 
seeking to catch Him in something He might say.

(Luke 12:1) 
Meanwhile, when many thousands of people gathered together, crushing each other, Jesus began to speak to His disciples, saying: "Be careful of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees!"

(Luke 12:2) 
For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor is there anything secret that will not be known.

(Luke 12:3) 
Therefore, whatever you speak in darkness will be spoken in the light, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.

(Luke 12:4) 
I say to you, my friends: Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that, they cannot do anything more.

(Luke 12:5) 
I will show you whom you should fear: fear the One who, after killing, has the power to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him.

(Luke 12:6) 
Are not five sparrows sold for two coins? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.

(Luke 12:7) 
Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.

(Luke 12:8) 
I tell you: Whoever acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.

(Luke 12:9) 
But whoever disowns Me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.

(Luke 12:10) 
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

(Luke 12:11) 
When they bring you before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should respond or what you should say,

(Luke 12:12) 
For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you ought to say.

(Luke 12:13) 
Then someone from the crowd said to Him: "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."

(Luke 12:14) 
Jesus replied to him: "Man, who appointed Me a judge or divider over you?"

(Luke 12:15) 
And He said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed, for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."

(Luke 12:16) 
Then He told them a parable: "The land of a rich man produced an abundant crop.

(Luke 12:17) 
And he thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'

(Luke 12:18) 
And he said, 'This is what I will do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.'

(Luke 12:19) 
And I will say to myself, 'You have many good things stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, and be merry.'

(Luke 12:20) 
But God said to him, 'You fool! This night your soul is required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?'

(Luke 12:21) 
So is the man who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."

(Luke 12:22) 
And He said to His disciples, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will put on.

(Luke 12:23) 
For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.

(Luke 12:24) 
Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, who have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them. How much more are you better than the birds?

(Luke 12:25) 
And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his stature?

(Luke 12:26) 
If you cannot do the least, why are you anxious about the rest?

(Luke 12:27) 
Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.

(Luke 12:28) 
Now if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?

(Luke 12:29) 
And do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink, nor be anxious.

(Luke 12:30) 
For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things.

(Luke 12:31) 
But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you.

(Luke 12:32) 
Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

(Luke 12:33) 
Sell what you have and give alms; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys.

(Luke 12:34) 
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

(Luke 12:35) 
Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning;

(Luke 12:36) 
and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master to return from the wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.

(Luke 12:37) 
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes! Truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.

(Luke 12:38) 
If he comes in the second watch, or if he comes in the third watch, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!

(Luke 12:39) 
But understand this: If the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

(Luke 12:40) 
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.

(Luke 12:41) 
Peter said to Him: "Lord, are You telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"

(Luke 12:42) 
And the Lord said: "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward whom his master will put in charge of his servants to give them their portion of food at the proper time?

(Luke 12:43) 
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.

(Luke 12:44) 
Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

(Luke 12:45) 
But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is delaying his coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,

(Luke 12:46) 
the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful.

(Luke 12:47) 
And that servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do what was required of him will be beaten with many blows.

(Luke 12:48) 
But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a few blows. To whom much is given, much will be required, and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded.

(Luke 12:49) 
I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!

(Luke 12:50) 
But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am constrained until it is completed!

(Luke 12:51) 
Do you think that I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.

(Luke 12:52) 
For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two, and two against three.

(Luke 12:53) 
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

(Luke 12:54) 
He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.

(Luke 12:55) 
And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, 'There will be scorching heat,' and it happens.

(Luke 12:56) 
You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?

(Luke 12:57) 
And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?

(Luke 12:58) 
When you go with your accuser before a magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

(Luke 12:59) 
I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny.

(Luke 13:1) 
At that time, some people told Jesus about some Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

(Luke 13:2) 
And He answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?

(Luke 13:3) 
I tell you, no; but unless you do penance, you will all perish in the same way.

(Luke 13:4) 
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell—do you think that they were debtors above all the people who live in Jerusalem?

(Luke 13:5) 
I tell you, no; but unless you do penance, you will all perish in the same way.

(Luke 13:6) 
He spoke also this parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.

(Luke 13:7) 
He said to the vinedresser, 'Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why does it still occupy the ground?'

(Luke 13:8) 
But he answering, said to him, 'Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.

(Luke 13:9) 
And if it bears fruit, well; but if not, then after that you can cut it down.'

(Luke 13:10) 
And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

(Luke 13:11) 
And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; and she was bent over and could not in any way look up.

(Luke 13:12) 
When Jesus saw her, He called her and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."

(Luke 13:13) 
And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

(Luke 13:14) 
And the ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days on which work ought to be done; come, therefore, and be cured on those days, and not on the Sabbath day."

(Luke 13:15) 
The Lord answered him, "Hypocrite, does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead them away to water?

(Luke 13:16) 
And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?"

(Luke 13:17) 
And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the people were rejoicing at all the glorious things that were being done by Him.

(Luke 13:18) 
He was saying therefore: "To what is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?

(Luke 13:19) 
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in its branches."

(Luke 13:20) 
And again He said, "To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

(Luke 13:21) 
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."

(Luke 13:22) 
And He was going through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying towards Jerusalem.

(Luke 13:23) 
And someone said to Him, "Lord, are only a few being saved?"

(Luke 13:24) 
But He said to them, "Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

(Luke 13:25) 
When once the householder has risen and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us.' And He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'

(Luke 13:26) 
Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.'

(Luke 13:27) 
And He will say to you, 'I do not know where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.'

(Luke 13:28) 
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.

(Luke 13:29) 
And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.

(Luke 13:30) 
And behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.

(Luke 13:31) 
At that very hour, some Pharisees came up and said to Him, "Go away and depart from here, for Herod wishes to kill You."

(Luke 13:32) 
And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected.'

(Luke 13:33) 
Nevertheless, I must go on My way today and tomorrow and the next day; for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem.

(Luke 13:34) 
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!

(Luke 13:35) 
Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I say to you that you shall not see Me until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.'

(Luke 14:1) 
One sabbath, Jesus went to eat bread in the house of a leader of the Pharisees, and they were all watching Him closely.

(Luke 14:2) 
A man suffering from dropsy was present before them.

(Luke 14:3) 
Jesus responded, asking the lawyers and Pharisees, “Is it permissible to heal on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 14:4) 
They remained silent. Then, taking hold of the man, He healed him and let him go.

(Luke 14:5) 
Then, He said to them, “If your donkey or ox falls into a well, who among you won’t immediately pull it out, even on the Sabbath?”

(Luke 14:6) 
They were not able to respond to these things.

(Luke 14:7) 
He also told a parable to those who were invited, as He observed how they chose the best places at the table, saying to them:

(Luke 14:8) 
“When you are invited to a wedding feast, don’t recline in the best place, lest a more important person than you has been invited.

(Luke 14:9) 
Then, the one who invited you and the other guest may come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then you would begin to take the lowest place with shame.

(Luke 14:10) 
But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then it will be a glory to you in the sight of all those at table with you.

(Luke 14:11) 
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

(Luke 14:12) 
He also said to the one who invited Him: “When you give a lunch or a dinner, don’t invite your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you back, and you will be repaid.

(Luke 14:13) 
But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.

(Luke 14:14) 
Then you will be blessed, because they have no means to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”

(Luke 14:15) 
Hearing this, one of those reclining at table with Him said to Him, “Blessed is the one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

(Luke 14:16) 
But He said to him: “A man once gave a great dinner and invited many.

(Luke 14:17) 
And at the time of the dinner, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited to come, because everything was now ready.

(Luke 14:18) 
But they all began to make excuses together. The first one said to him, ‘I bought a piece of land, and I must go out and see it. I ask you, consider me excused.’

(Luke 14:19) 
And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m going to try them out. I ask you, consider me excused.’

(Luke 14:20) 
And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’

(Luke 14:21) 
The servant returned and reported these things to his master. Then, the master of the house, angered, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.’

(Luke 14:22) 
The servant said, ‘Master, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’

(Luke 14:23) 
And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.’

(Luke 14:24) 
I tell you, that none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner.”

(Luke 14:25) 
Large crowds were traveling with Him; and turning, He said to them:

(Luke 14:26) 
“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:27) 
And whoever does not carry his own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:28) 
For which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?

(Luke 14:29) 
Otherwise, after laying the foundation but not being able to complete it, all who see it may begin to ridicule him,

(Luke 14:30) 
saying, ‘This man began to build but was not able to finish.’

(Luke 14:31) 
Or what king, going to war against another king, does not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?

(Luke 14:32) 
If he is not able, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.

(Luke 14:33) 
So, in the same way, whoever of you does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be My disciple.

(Luke 14:34) 
Salt is good; but if the salt loses its flavor, with what will it be seasoned?

(Luke 14:35) 
It is neither good for the land nor for the manure pile; they throw it out. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”

(Luke 15:1) 
The tax collectors and other sinners were approaching Jesus to listen to Him.

(Luke 15:2) 
But the Pharisees and scribes were murmuring. They said, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

(Luke 15:3) 
He then told them this parable:

(Luke 15:4) 
“If one of you has one hundred sheep, and loses one of them, won't you leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until you find it?

(Luke 15:5) 
And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders rejoicing.

(Luke 15:6) 
When he arrives home, he calls his friends and neighbors, saying to them: ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my sheep that was lost.’”

(Luke 15:7) 
“I tell you, there will be more joy in the sky over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance.”

(Luke 15:8) 
“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins, if she loses one, does she not light a lamp, sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it?

(Luke 15:9) 
When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors, saying: ‘Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I had lost.’”

(Luke 15:10) 
“So I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

(Luke 15:11) 
And He said: “A certain man had two sons:

(Luke 15:12) 
The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of inheritance that belongs to me.’ So the father divided his property between them.

(Luke 15:13) 
Not long after, the younger son gathered all his possessions and set off for a distant country. There, he squandered his wealth in wild living.

(Luke 15:14) 
When he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.

(Luke 15:15) 
So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed swine.

(Luke 15:16) 
And he longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.

(Luke 15:17) 
Then, when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, and I am dying here of hunger?

(Luke 15:18) 
I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against the sky and before you.

(Luke 15:19) 
I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”

(Luke 15:20) 
So he arose and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him, and kissed him.

(Luke 15:21) 
And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against the sky and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

(Luke 15:22) 
But the father said to his servants, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

(Luke 15:23) 
Also bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us eat and celebrate.

(Luke 15:24) 
For this my son was dead and has come back to life; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.

(Luke 15:25) 
Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.

(Luke 15:26) 
He summoned one of the servants and asked what these things meant.

(Luke 15:27) 
The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’

(Luke 15:28) 
But he was angry and refused to go in. Therefore his father came out and began to plead with him.

(Luke 15:29) 
But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends.

(Luke 15:30) 
But when this son of yours, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, came, you killed the fattened calf for him.’

(Luke 15:31) 
And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.

(Luke 15:32) 
But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead and has come back to life, and was lost and is found.’”

(Luke 16:1) 
Jesus also said to his disciples: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. This manager was accused of wasting his possessions.

(Luke 16:2) 
So the rich man called him and said, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can no longer be my manager.’

(Luke 16:3) 
The manager said to himself, ‘What am I going to do now that my master is taking away my management? I cannot dig, and I am ashamed to beg.’

(Luke 16:4) 
‘I know what I will do, so that, when I am removed from my management, people may welcome me into their houses.’

(Luke 16:5) 
So he summoned each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’

(Luke 16:6) 
He replied, ‘One hundred measures of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Here is your bill. Sit down quickly and write fifty.’

(Luke 16:7) 
Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘One hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and write eighty.’

(Luke 16:8) 
And the master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.

(Luke 16:9) 
And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.

(Luke 16:10) 
He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much. And he who is unjust in a very little thing is unjust also in much.

(Luke 16:11) 
If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will trust you with the true wealth?

(Luke 16:12) 
And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?

(Luke 16:13) 
No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

(Luke 16:14) 
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things, and they ridiculed Him.

(Luke 16:15) 
And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.

(Luke 16:16) 
The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since then the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it.

(Luke 16:17) 
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.

(Luke 16:18) 
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.

(Luke 16:19) 
“There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and who feasted sumptuously every day.

(Luke 16:20) 
And at his gate was laid a certain beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores,

(Luke 16:21) 
longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.

(Luke 16:22) 
So it was that the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried in hell.

(Luke 16:23) 
And in hell, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.

(Luke 16:24) 
And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.’

(Luke 16:25) 
But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented.’

(Luke 16:26) 
And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.’

(Luke 16:27) 
And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father’s house—

(Luke 16:28) 
for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.’

(Luke 16:29) 
But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’

(Luke 16:30) 
And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’

(Luke 16:31) 
He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though someone rises from the dead.’

(Luke 17:1) 
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "It is impossible that no scandals come, but woe to him by whom they come!"

(Luke 17:2) 
It is better for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is thrown into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.

(Luke 17:3) 
Be careful about this. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

(Luke 17:4) 
And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times a day turns back to you saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.

(Luke 17:5) 
And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."

(Luke 17:6) 
And the Lord said: "If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you."

(Luke 17:7) 
But who of you, having a servant plowing or feeding sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and recline at table'?

(Luke 17:8) 
And will he not say to him, 'Prepare my dinner, and gird yourself and serve me, until I have eaten and drunk; and afterward you shall eat and drink'?

(Luke 17:9) 
Does he thank that servant because he did the things commanded him? I do not think so.

(Luke 17:10) 
So you also, when you have done all that is commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have done what we ought to do.'

(Luke 17:11) 
And it came to pass as He was going to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

(Luke 17:12) 
And as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.

(Luke 17:13) 
And they lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"

(Luke 17:14) 
And when He saw them, He said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And it happened that as they went, they were cleansed.

(Luke 17:15) 
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, glorifying God with a loud voice,

(Luke 17:16) 
and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.

(Luke 17:17) 
And Jesus answering, said: "Were there not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?

(Luke 17:18) 
Was there not any found to return and give glory to God, except this foreigner?

(Luke 17:19) 
And He said to him, "Arise, go your way; your faith has made you whole."

(Luke 17:20) 
And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation;"

(Luke 17:21) 
nor will they say, 'See here!' or 'See there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you."

(Luke 17:22) 
Then He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.

(Luke 17:23) 
And they will say to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go, nor follow them.

(Luke 17:24) 
For as the lightning flashes out of one part under heaven, and shines to the other part under heaven, so also will the Son of Man be in His day.

(Luke 17:25) 
But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

(Luke 17:26) 
And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the Son of Man:

(Luke 17:27) 
they ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

(Luke 17:28) 
Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;

(Luke 17:29) 
but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

(Luke 17:30) 
Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.

(Luke 17:31) 
In that day, he who is on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back.

(Luke 17:32) 
Remember Lot's wife.

(Luke 17:33) 
Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.

(Luke 17:34) 
I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed: one will be taken and the other will be left.

(Luke 17:35) 
Two women will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.

(Luke 17:36) 
Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.

(Luke 17:37) 
And answering, they said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together."

(Luke 18:1) 
Jesus told this parable to those who were very confident in their own righteousness and who looked down on everyone else:

(Luke 18:2) 
“Two men went up to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.

(Luke 18:3) 
“The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—thieves, rogues, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.

(Luke 18:4) 
I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of all I get.’

(Luke 18:5) 
“But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’

(Luke 18:6) 
“I tell you, this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

(Luke 18:7) 
People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to touch. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

(Luke 18:8) 
But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.

(Luke 18:9) 
Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

(Luke 18:10) 
A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

(Luke 18:11) 
“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone.

(Luke 18:12) 
You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’

(Luke 18:13) 
“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he replied.

(Luke 18:14) 
When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”

(Luke 18:15) 
When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.

(Luke 18:16) 
Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!

(Luke 18:17) 
Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”

(Luke 18:18) 
Those who heard this asked, “Then who can be saved?”

(Luke 18:19) 
Jesus replied, “What is impossible for human beings is possible for God.”

(Luke 18:20) 
Peter said, “We have left our own homes and followed you.”

(Luke 18:21) 
And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left home or parents or brothers or sisters or wife or children for the sake of the kingdom of God

(Luke 18:22) 
who will not receive many times more in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.”

(Luke 18:23) 
Then he took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be fulfilled.

(Luke 18:24) 
He will be delivered over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, insulted, and spat upon.

(Luke 18:25) 
They will flog him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.”

(Luke 18:26) 
The disciples understood none of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.

(Luke 18:27) 
As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting by the roadside.

(Luke 18:28) 
When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.

(Luke 18:29) 
They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”

(Luke 18:30) 
He cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

(Luke 18:31) 
Those who were in front told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”

(Luke 18:32) 
Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,

(Luke 18:33) 
“What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord,” he replied, “I want to see.”

(Luke 18:34) 
Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. When all the people saw this, they also praised God.

(Luke 19:1) 
And having entered, He was passing through Jericho.

(Luke 19:2) 
And behold, a man, by the name of Zacchaeus: and he was the chief of the tax collectors, and he himself was rich:

(Luke 19:3) 
and he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was: and he could not because of the crowd, because he was small in stature.

(Luke 19:4) 
And running ahead, he ran behind, and he climbed a sycamore tree to see Him: because He was to pass by that way.

(Luke 19:5) 
And when He had come to the place, looking up, Jesus saw him, and said to him: "Zacchaeus, hurry down: because today I must stay in your house."

(Luke 19:6) 
And he hurried down, and received Him, rejoicing.

(Luke 19:7) 
And when all saw, they murmured, saying that He had turned aside to a sinful man.

(Luke 19:8) 
But standing, Zacchaeus said to the Lord: "Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor: and if I have defrauded anyone, I restore fourfold."

(Luke 19:9) 
Jesus said to him: "Today salvation has come to this house: because he is also a son of Abraham."

(Luke 19:10) 
For the Son of Man came to seek, and to save that which was lost.

(Luke 19:11) 
And while they were listening to these things, He added a parable: because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

(Luke 19:12) 
He said therefore: "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."

(Luke 19:13) 
And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten talents, and said to them: 'Do business until I come."

(Luke 19:14) 
But his citizens hated him: and they sent a delegation after him, saying: 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'

(Luke 19:15) 
And it came to pass that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what they had gained.

(Luke 19:16) 
And the first came, saying: 'Lord, your talent has gained ten talents.'

(Luke 19:17) 
And he said to him: 'Well done, good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you will have power over ten cities.'

(Luke 19:18) 
And the second came, saying: 'Lord, your talent has made five talents.'

(Luke 19:19) 
And to this one he said: 'You also shall be over five cities.'

(Luke 19:20) 
And another came, saying: 'Lord, behold, your talent, which I had put away in a napkin:

(Luke 19:21) 
For I feared you, because you are a harsh man: you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.'

(Luke 19:22) 
He said to him: 'By your own mouth I judge you, wicked servant. You knew that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:

(Luke 19:23) 
and why did you not put my money at the table? And I, coming, might have required it with interest.'

(Luke 19:24) 
And to those who were standing there, he said: 'Take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has ten talents.'

(Luke 19:25) 
And they said to him: 'Lord, he has ten talents.'

(Luke 19:26) 
I tell you, because to everyone who has, more will be given, and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

(Luke 19:27) 
But as for those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here, and kill them before me.'

(Luke 19:28) 
And when He had said these things, He went on, going up to Jerusalem.

(Luke 19:29) 
And it happened, when He had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mountain that is called Olivet, He sent two of His disciples,

(Luke 19:30) 
saying: 'Go into the village which is opposite you: entering into it, you will find a colt of an ass tied, on which no one has ever sat: untie him, and bring him.'

(Luke 19:31) 
And if anyone asks you: "Why are you untying it?" so shall you say to him: 'Because the Lord has need of his service.'

(Luke 19:32) 
And they that were sent went, and found it as He had told them.

(Luke 19:33) 
And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them: 'Why are you untying the colt?'

(Luke 19:34) 
And they said: 'Because the Lord has need of him.'

(Luke 19:35) 
And they led him to Jesus: and casting their garments on the colt, they placed Jesus on it.

(Luke 19:36) 
And as He went, they spread their garments in the way.

(Luke 19:37) 
And when He was now approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen,

(Luke 19:38) 
saying: "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."

(Luke 19:39) 
And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him: "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."

(Luke 19:40) 
To whom He said: "I tell you, that if these should be silent, the stones will cry out."

(Luke 19:41) 
And when He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,

(Luke 19:42) 
saying: "If only you had known, even you, and especially on this day, the things that belong to your peace: but now they are hidden from your eyes.

(Luke 19:43) 
For the days will come upon you: and your enemies will build a rampart around you, and they will encircle you and hem you in on every side:

(Luke 19:44) 
and they will dash you to the ground, and your children within you: and they will not leave in you one stone upon another: because you did not know the time of your visitation."

(Luke 19:45) 
And entering the temple, He began to cast out those who were selling and buying in it,

(Luke 19:46) 
saying to them: "It is written: 'My house is a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of thieves."

(Luke 19:47) 
And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief men of the people sought to destroy Him:

(Luke 19:48) 
and they did not find what they could do to Him: for all the people were hanging on to Him, listening.

(Luke 20:1) 
One day, as Jesus was teaching the crowds in the Temple and preaching the Good News, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came up to Him.

(Luke 20:2) 
They said: “Tell us, by what authority do You do these things? Or who gave You this authority?”

(Luke 20:3) 
Jesus answered, saying to them: “I will also ask you one question. Answer Me,

(Luke 20:4) 
Was John’s baptism from Heaven, or from men?”

(Luke 20:5) 
They reasoned among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From Heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’

(Luke 20:6) 
But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, because they are certain that John was a prophet.”

(Luke 20:7) 
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.

(Luke 20:8) 
Jesus said to them: “Then neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

(Luke 20:9) 
Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went away for a long time.

(Luke 20:10) 
At the right time, he sent a servant to the tenant farmers, so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers, after beating him, sent him away empty-handed.

(Luke 20:11) 
So he sent another servant, but they beat him, insulted him, and sent him away empty-handed as well.

(Luke 20:12) 
Then he sent a third servant. They wounded this one and threw him out.

(Luke 20:13) 
Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Surely they will respect him.’

(Luke 20:14) 
But when the tenant farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance will be ours.’

(Luke 20:15) 
So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

(Luke 20:16) 
He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and will give the vineyard to others.” Hearing this, they said: “May it never be!”

(Luke 20:17) 
But looking at them, He said: “Then what does this Scripture mean: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?

(Luke 20:18) 
“Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and upon whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

(Luke 20:19) 
The chief priests and the scribes sought to arrest Him that very hour, but they feared the people, because they knew He had spoken this parable against them.

(Luke 20:20) 
Watching closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, to trap Him in His speech, so that they could hand Him over to the authority and the power of the governor.

(Luke 20:21) 
So they questioned Him, saying: “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and that You do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.

(Luke 20:22) 
Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

(Luke 20:23) 
But He perceived their craftiness and said to them: “Why do you test Me?

(Luke 20:24) 
Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?”

(Luke 20:25) 
They replied, “Caesar’s.” So He said to them: “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

(Luke 20:26) 
They could not take hold of His word in front of the people, and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.

(Luke 20:27) 
Then some Sadducees came up to Him, who deny the resurrection, and they questioned Him,

(Luke 20:28) 
saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.

(Luke 20:29) 
Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, but died childless.

(Luke 20:30) 
Then the second and third brother married her,

(Luke 20:31) 
and the third took her, and in the same way all seven, but they left no children and died.

(Luke 20:32) 
Finally, the woman died too.

(Luke 20:33) 
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as a wife.”

(Luke 20:34) 
Jesus said to them: “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,

(Luke 20:35) 
but those who are considered worthy to attain the next age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.

(Luke 20:36) 
For they cannot die anymore, since they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

(Luke 20:37) 
But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

(Luke 20:38) 
Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”

(Luke 20:39) 
Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well.”

(Luke 20:40) 
And they dared not question Him any further.

(Luke 20:41) 
Then He said to them: “How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?

(Luke 20:42) 
For David himself says in the Book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand,

(Luke 20:43) 
until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’

(Luke 20:44) 
David therefore calls Him Lord, so how is He his son?

(Luke 20:45) 
As all the people were listening, He said to His disciples:

(Luke 20:46) 
“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.

(Luke 20:47) 
They devour the houses of widows, pretending to pray at length; these will receive a greater condemnation.”

(Luke 21:1) 
And having raised His eyes, He saw those who were throwing their gifts into the treasury.

(Luke 21:2) 
He also saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites.

(Luke 21:3) 
And He said: "Truly, I say to you, that this poor widow put in more than all the rest.

(Luke 21:4) 
For all these put in gifts out of their abundance, into the works of God: but she from that which she lacks, she put in her whole living."

(Luke 21:5) 
And as some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with good stones and gifts, He said:

(Luke 21:6) 
"These things which you see, the days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone that will not be torn down."

(Luke 21:7) 
And they asked Him, saying: "Teacher, when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to happen?"

(Luke 21:8) 
Who said: "See that you are not seduced; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and 'The time is at hand.' Do not therefore go after them.

(Luke 21:9) 
And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end is not immediately."

(Luke 21:10) 
Then He said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

(Luke 21:11) 
And great earthquakes will be in various places, and plagues, and famines; and terrors from heaven, and great signs will be.

(Luke 21:12) 
But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, dragging you to kings and governors for My name's sake.

(Luke 21:13) 
And this will be for a testimony to you.

(Luke 21:14) 
Therefore lay it up in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how you should answer.

(Luke 21:15) 
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.

(Luke 21:16) 
But you will be delivered up even by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and some of you they will put to death.

(Luke 21:17) 
And you will be hated by all because of My name.

(Luke 21:18) 
And not a hair of your head will perish.

(Luke 21:19) 
In your patience you will possess your souls.

(Luke 21:20) 
And when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, then know that its desolation has drawn near.

(Luke 21:21) 
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and those who are in the midst of it, depart; and those who are in the regions, not enter into it.

(Luke 21:22) 
For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

(Luke 21:23) 
But woe to those who are pregnant and nursing in those days; for there will be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

(Luke 21:24) 
And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

(Luke 21:25) 
And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea and the waves,

(Luke 21:26) 
men withering away for fear, and for expectation of the things which will come upon the whole world: for the powers of the heavens will be moved.

(Luke 21:27) 
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty.

(Luke 21:28) 
And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.

(Luke 21:29) 
And He spoke to them a parable: "See the fig tree, and all the trees:

(Luke 21:30) 
When they are already budding, you know that summer is near.

(Luke 21:31) 
So you also, when you see these things happen, know that the kingdom of God is near.

(Luke 21:32) 
Amen I say to you, that this generation will not pass away, until all things are fulfilled.

(Luke 21:33) 
The universe and the earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

(Luke 21:34) 
And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with overeating and drunkenness and the cares of this life; and that day come upon you suddenly.

(Luke 21:35) 
For as a snare it will come upon all those who sit upon the face of the whole earth.

(Luke 21:36) 
Watch therefore, praying at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come, and to stand before the Son of Man.

(Luke 21:37) 
And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple; and going out in the night, He would stay at the mountain which is called Olivet.

(Luke 21:38) 
And all the people came early in the morning to Him in the temple to listen to Him.

(Luke 22:1) 
The feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was now approaching.

(Luke 22:2) 
The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put Him to death, but they were afraid of the people.

(Luke 22:3) 
Then Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.

(Luke 22:4) 
And he went away, and he spoke with the chief priests and the captains about how he might betray Him to them.

(Luke 22:5) 
They were glad, and they agreed to give him money.

(Luke 22:6) 
And he promised, and he sought an opportunity to betray Him in the absence of the crowd.

(Luke 22:7) 
Then came the day of the Unleavened Bread, on which it was necessary that the Passover should be sacrificed.

(Luke 22:8) 
And He sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and prepare the Passover for us that we may eat.”

(Luke 22:9) 
But they said, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”

(Luke 22:10) 
And He said to them, “Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.

(Luke 22:11) 
And you shall say to the master of the house: ‘The Master says to you: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’

(Luke 22:12) 
And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Prepare it there.”

(Luke 22:13) 
And they went, and they found as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.

(Luke 22:14) 
And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the twelve Apostles with Him.

(Luke 22:15) 
And He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

(Luke 22:16) 
For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”

(Luke 22:17) 
And taking a chalice, He gave thanks and said, “Take this, and divide it among yourselves.

(Luke 22:18) 
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”

(Luke 22:19) 
And taking bread, He gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”

(Luke 22:20) 
Likewise also the chalice, after supper, saying: “This is the chalice, the new testament in My blood, which will be poured out for you.”

(Luke 22:21) 
Yet behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.

(Luke 22:22) 
And truly the Son of Man goes according to what is determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”

(Luke 22:23) 
And they began to inquire among themselves who it was that would do this.

(Luke 22:24) 
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should seem to be the greater.

(Luke 22:25) 
But He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have power over them are called benefactors.

(Luke 22:26) 
But not so with you. Instead, let the one who is greatest among you become as the least, and the leader as the one who serves.

(Luke 22:27) 
For who is greater, the one who reclines or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am in your midst as one who serves.

(Luke 22:28) 
You are those who have remained with Me in My trials.

(Luke 22:29) 
And I appoint to you, as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,

(Luke 22:30) 
that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

(Luke 22:31) 
And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat.

(Luke 22:32) 
But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.”

(Luke 22:33) 
He said to Him, “Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.”

(Luke 22:34) 
But He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied Me three times that you know Me.”

(Luke 22:35) 
And He said to them, “When I sent you without a purse or a bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”

(Luke 22:36) 
They said, “Nothing.” Then He said to them, “But now, let the one who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag, and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.

(Luke 22:37) 
For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was reckoned with the lawless.’ For those things concerning Me have an end.”

(Luke 22:38) 
And they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It is enough.”

(Luke 22:39) 
And going out, He went as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.

(Luke 22:40) 
And when He arrived at the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

(Luke 22:41) 
And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw; and He knelt down and prayed,

(Luke 22:42) 
saying, “Father, if You are willing, remove this chalice from Me. But not My will, but Yours, be done.”

(Luke 22:43) 
And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him.

(Luke 22:44) 
And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

(Luke 22:45) 
And when He arose from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.

(Luke 22:46) 
And He said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

(Luke 22:47) 
While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came up, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and approached Jesus to kiss Him.

(Luke 22:48) 
But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”

(Luke 22:49) 
When those who were with Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”

(Luke 22:50) 
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

(Luke 22:51) 
But Jesus answered and said, “Stop! No more of this.” And He touched his ear and healed him.

(Luke 22:52) 
Then Jesus said to those who had come out to Him, the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

(Luke 22:53) 
When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”

(Luke 22:54) 
Then, taking Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.

(Luke 22:55) 
And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting together, Peter was in the midst of them.

(Luke 22:56) 
But when a certain servant girl saw him sitting near the light, and looking closely at him, she said, “This man was also with Him.”

(Luke 22:57) 
But he denied Him, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”

(Luke 22:58) 
And after a little while, another one seeing him said, “You are also one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”

(Luke 22:59) 
And after about an hour had passed, another one was insisting, saying, “Truly, this man also was with Him, for he is also a Galilean.”

(Luke 22:60) 
But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

(Luke 22:61) 
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”

(Luke 22:62) 
And Peter went out and wept bitterly.

(Luke 22:63) 
And the men who were holding Him mocked Him, beating Him.

(Luke 22:64) 
And they blindfolded Him, and struck His face, and were questioning Him, saying, “Prophesy, who is the one who struck you?”

(Luke 22:65) 
And they were saying many other blasphemies against Him.

(Luke 22:66) 
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people assembled, along with the chief priests and scribes, and they led Him into their council,

(Luke 22:67) 
saying, “If You are the Christ, tell us.”

(Luke 22:68) 
But He said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe Me,

(Luke 22:69) 
and if I also ask you, you will not answer Me, nor will you let Me go.

(Luke 22:70) 
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”

(Luke 22:71) 
They all said, “Are You then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”

(Luke 22:72) 
And they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”

(Luke 23:1) 
And the entire crowd rose and led Him to Pilate.

(Luke 23:2) 
They began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding taxes to be paid to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ the King.”

(Luke 23:3) 
Pilate questioned Him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “You say so.”

(Luke 23:4) 
Pilate then said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no crime in this man.”

(Luke 23:5) 
But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.”

(Luke 23:6) 
When Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

(Luke 23:7) 
And when he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.

(Luke 23:8) 
Herod, upon seeing Jesus, was greatly pleased. For he had long desired to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle performed by Him.

(Luke 23:9) 
He questioned Him at length, but Jesus gave him no answer.

(Luke 23:10) 
Meanwhile, the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.

(Luke 23:11) 
Herod, along with his soldiers, scorned and mocked Jesus. He dressed Him in a white robe and sent Him back to Pilate.

(Luke 23:12) 
And on that day, Herod and Pilate became friends, for they had been enemies before.

(Luke 23:13) 
Pilate, having called together the chief priests, the magistrates, and the people,

(Luke 23:14) 
said to them, “You have brought this man to me as one who perverts the people. Behold, I have examined Him before you and have found in this man no cause for the accusations you bring against Him.

(Luke 23:15) 
Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him.

(Luke 23:16) 
Therefore, I will chastise Him and release Him.”

(Luke 23:17) 
Now, he was obliged to release one prisoner to them at the feast.

(Luke 23:18) 
Then the whole crowd cried out together, saying, “Away with this man, and release Barabbas to us:

(Luke 23:19) 
Barabbas, who had been imprisoned for a riot that occurred in the city, and for murder.

(Luke 23:20) 
Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,

(Luke 23:21) 
But they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”

(Luke 23:22) 
Pilate addressed them a third time: “Why? What evil has He done? I find no cause of death in Him. Therefore, I will chastise Him and release Him.”

(Luke 23:23) 
But they persisted, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.

(Luke 23:24) 
So Pilate gave his decision that their demand should be granted.

(Luke 23:25) 
He released the man who was imprisoned for sedition and murder, the one they had asked for, but he handed Jesus over to their will.

(Luke 23:26) 
As they led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and they laid the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.

(Luke 23:27) 
A great crowd of people and women followed Him, and they were mourning and lamenting Him.

(Luke 23:28) 
But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

(Luke 23:29) 
For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’

(Luke 23:30) 
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’

(Luke 23:31) 
For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

(Luke 23:32) 
Two others, both criminals, were also being led away to be executed with Him.

(Luke 23:33) 
When they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him, and also the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.

(Luke 23:34) 
And Jesus was saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” They divided His garments and cast lots.

(Luke 23:35) 
And the people stood watching, and the rulers scoffed at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the chosen one.”

(Luke 23:36) 
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him and offering Him vinegar,

(Luke 23:37) 
saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.”

(Luke 23:38) 
There was also an inscription over Him, written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”

(Luke 23:39) 
One of the criminals hanging there blasphemed Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”

(Luke 23:40) 
But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?

(Luke 23:41) 
And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”

(Luke 23:42) 
And he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.”

(Luke 23:43) 
And Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”

(Luke 23:44) 
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.

(Luke 23:45) 
The sun was obscured, and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.

(Luke 23:46) 
And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.” And having said this, He breathed His last.

(Luke 23:47) 
When the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent.”

(Luke 23:48) 
And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, seeing what had taken place, returned home, beating their breasts.

(Luke 23:49) 
And all His acquaintances, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

(Luke 23:50) 
And behold, a man named Joseph, who was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, a good and righteous man,

(Luke 23:51) 
who had not agreed to their plan and action, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God,

(Luke 23:52) 
this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

(Luke 23:53) 
He took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever been laid.

(Luke 23:54) 
It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning.

(Luke 23:55) 
The women who had come with Him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.

(Luke 23:56) 
Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.

(Luke 24:1) 
Very early on the first day of the week, the women went to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.

(Luke 24:2) 
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

(Luke 24:3) 
They went inside, but they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.

(Luke 24:4) 
While they were stunned and didn't know what to make of this, two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them.

(Luke 24:5) 
The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. The men asked them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?

(Luke 24:6) 
He isn't here! He's risen! Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee,

(Luke 24:7) 
telling you that the Son of Man must be handed over to the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise on the third day?”

(Luke 24:8) 
Then they remembered His words.

(Luke 24:9) 
They returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the others.

(Luke 24:10) 
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told the apostles these things.

(Luke 24:11) 
The apostles thought what the women said was nonsense, and they didn't believe them.

(Luke 24:12) 
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw the linen cloths but nothing else. Then he went away, wondering what had happened.

(Luke 24:13) 
That same day, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,

(Luke 24:14) 
and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.

(Luke 24:15) 
As they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and walked with them.

(Luke 24:16) 
But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.

(Luke 24:17) 
He asked them, “What are you discussing with each other as you walk along?” They stopped, looking sad.

(Luke 24:18) 
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days?”

(Luke 24:19) 
He asked them, “What things?” They said, “About Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in word and deed before God and all the people,

(Luke 24:20) 
and how our chief priests and leaders handed Him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified Him.

(Luke 24:21) 
We had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.

(Luke 24:22) 
Some women of our group have astonished us. They went to the tomb early this morning,

(Luke 24:23) 
and didn't find His body. They came back saying they had even seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.

(Luke 24:24) 
Some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Him.”

(Luke 24:25) 
Then Jesus said to them, “You foolish people! You are slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

(Luke 24:26) 
Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter His glory?”

(Luke 24:27) 
And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.

(Luke 24:28) 
As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if He were going farther.

(Luke 24:29) 
But they urged Him, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them.

(Luke 24:30) 
When He was at the table with them, He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and began to give it to them.

(Luke 24:31) 
Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. But He vanished from their sight.

(Luke 24:32) 
They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening the Scriptures to us?”

(Luke 24:33) 
They got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven disciples and those with them gathered together,

(Luke 24:34) 
and they were saying, “The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Simon!”

(Luke 24:35) 
Then the two disciples told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Him when He broke the bread.

(Luke 24:36) 
While they were talking about this, Jesus Himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace to you.” But they were startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost.

(Luke 24:37) 
But they were startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost.

(Luke 24:38) 
He said to them, “Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?

(Luke 24:39) 
Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself! Touch Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.”

(Luke 24:40) 
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.

(Luke 24:41) 
Because they still did not believe for joy, and were astonished, He said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”

(Luke 24:42) 
They gave Him a piece of broiled fish, and some honeycomb.

(Luke 24:43) 
He took it and ate it in front of them.

(Luke 24:44) 
Then He said to them, “These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”

(Luke 24:45) 
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.

(Luke 24:46) 
He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ must suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,

(Luke 24:47) 
and repentance and forgiveness of sins must be preached in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

(Luke 24:48) 
You are witnesses of these things.

(Luke 24:49) 
And look, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

(Luke 24:50) 
Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

(Luke 24:51) 
As He was blessing them, He departed from them and was carried up into the universe.

(Luke 24:52) 
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

(Luke 24:53) 
and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

(John 1:1) 
Eternally, God the Son has been the Son of God the Father, and God the Son has had all the power, wisdom, and love of God the Father.

(John 1:2) 
God the Son has always been One God with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, who shares in all of the power, wisdom, and love of the Father and the Son.

(John 1:3) 
All things were made by Jesus Christ Our Lord, there is nothing that was not made by him.

(John 1:4) 
In His light is all fulfillment and everything meaningful about life.

(John 1:5) 
And the light of Him shined in the world darkened by sin, and the dark and sinful world could not understand Him.

(John 1:6) 
There was a man who was sent on a mission by God, and his name was John.

(John 1:7) 
He came to be a witness, to testify concerning the light, so that all might believe in the light.

(John 1:8) 
He wasn't the light, but he came to testify about the light.

(John 1:9) 
The true light was coming into the world, which illuminates every person.

(John 1:10) 
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know Him.

(John 1:11) 
He came to his own people, and his own people did not receive Him.

(John 1:12) 
But to all who did receive Him, He gave the power to become children of God; to those who believe in His name.

(John 1:13) 
They were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

(John 1:14) 
And God the Son became a man of flesh and blood, and He lived among us. We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

(John 1:15) 
John testified about Him and cried out, saying, “This is He who was to come after me, but He was before me, because He was before me.”

(John 1:16) 
From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.

(John 1:17) 
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

(John 1:18) 
No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is at the Father's side, He has made Him known.

(John 1:19) 
And this is the testimony of John: when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”

(John 1:20) 
He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”

(John 1:21) 
They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”

(John 1:22) 
So they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”

(John 1:23) 
He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”

(John 1:24) 
Now they who had been sent were from the Pharisees.

(John 1:25) 
And they asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”

(John 1:26) 
John answered them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands One you do not know.

(John 1:27) 
He is the One who comes after me, who is before me, and I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.”

(John 1:28) 
These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

(John 1:29) 
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

(John 1:30) 
This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who is before me, because He was before me.’

(John 1:31) 
I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was so that He might be revealed to Israel.”

(John 1:32) 
And John testified, “I have seen the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him.

(John 1:33) 
I myself did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit descending and remaining, He is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’

(John 1:34) 
And I have seen, and I have testified that this is the Son of God.”

(John 1:35) 
The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples.

(John 1:36) 
And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”

(John 1:37) 
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

(John 1:38) 
Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, “What are you seeking?” They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”

(John 1:39) 
He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.

(John 1:40) 
One of the two who heard John and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

(John 1:41) 
He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).

(John 1:42) 
He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).

(John 1:43) 
The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, “Follow Me.”

(John 1:44) 
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

(John 1:45) 
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”

(John 1:46) 
And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”

(John 1:47) 
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”

(John 1:48) 
Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”

(John 1:49) 
Nathanael answered Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”

(John 1:50) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”

(John 1:51) 
And He said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

(John 2:1) 
On the third day, a wedding was held in Cana of Galilee. The Mother of Jesus was there.

(John 2:2) 
Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.

(John 2:3) 
When the wine gave out, the Mother of Jesus said to Him, "They have no wine."

(John 2:4) 
And Jesus said to her, "What is that to Me and to you, woman? My hour has not yet come."

(John 2:5) 
His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever He tells you."

(John 2:6) 
Now there were six stone water jars there, placed for the Jewish custom of cleansing, each holding two or three measures.

(John 2:7) 
Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them up to the brim.

(John 2:8) 
Then He said to them, "Draw some out now, and take it to the headwaiter." And they took it.

(John 2:9) 
When the headwaiter tasted the water that had been turned into wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom,

(John 2:10) 
and said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first; and when they have drunk freely, then the less good wine. But you have kept the good wine until now."

(John 2:11) 
Jesus did this as the beginning of His signs in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.

(John 2:12) 
After this He went down to Capernaum, with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.

(John 2:13) 
The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

(John 2:14) 
In the temple, He found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and also the money changers sitting there.

(John 2:15) 
And He made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.

(John 2:16) 
And to those who were selling doves, He said, "Take these things away; do not make My Father's house a house of trade."

(John 2:17) 
His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for Your house will consume me."

(John 2:18) 
The Jews then responded and said to Him, "What sign do You show us for doing these things?"

(John 2:19) 
Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."

(John 2:20) 
The Jews then said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will You raise it up in three days?"

(John 2:21) 
But He was speaking of the temple of His body.

(John 2:22) 
So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.

(John 2:23) 
Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the festival, many believed in His name because they saw the signs He was performing.

(John 2:24) 
But Jesus Himself was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all men,

(John 2:25) 
and because He had no need that anyone should testify about man, for He knew what was in man.

(John 3:1) 
There was a Pharisee, a leader of the Jews, named Nicodemus.

(John 3:2) 
This man came to see Jesus at night, and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher sent by God; because no one can do these signs which you do, unless God is with him.”

(John 3:3) 
Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

(John 3:4) 
Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”

(John 3:5) 
Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.

(John 3:6) 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

(John 3:7) 
Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’

(John 3:8) 
The Spirit blows where He wishes, and you hear the sound of Him, but you do not know where He comes from, or where He goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

(John 3:9) 
Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?”

(John 3:10) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?

(John 3:11) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify to what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.

(John 3:12) 
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

(John 3:13) 
And no one has ascended into the sky except the one who descended from the sky, the Son of Man, who is in the sky.

(John 3:14) 
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;

(John 3:15) 
so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life.

(John 3:16) 
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

(John 3:17) 
For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

(John 3:18) 
He who believes in Him is not judged; but he who does not believe is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

(John 3:19) 
And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

(John 3:20) 
For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.

(John 3:21) 
But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, because they have been wrought in God.”

(John 3:22) 
After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was staying with them, and baptizing.

(John 3:23) 
John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they were coming and being baptized.

(John 3:24) 
For John had not yet been put in prison.

(John 3:25) 
Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews concerning purification.

(John 3:26) 
And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him.”

(John 3:27) 
John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.

(John 3:28) 
You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent ahead of Him.’

(John 3:29) 
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.

(John 3:30) 
He must increase, but I must decrease.

(John 3:31) 
He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of earthly things. He who comes from heaven is above all.

(John 3:32) 
And what He has seen and heard, of that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.

(John 3:33) 
He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.

(John 3:34) 
For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.

(John 3:35) 
The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.

(John 3:36) 
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.

(John 4:1) 
The Lord realized that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,

(John 4:2) 
Though it was actually the disciples who were baptizing, not Jesus himself,

(John 4:3) 
He left Judea and went back into Galilee.

(John 4:4) 
But it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.

(John 4:5) 
He arrived at a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

(John 4:6) 
Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, tired from the journey, sat down beside the well. It was about noon.

(John 4:7) 
A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”

(John 4:8) 
For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.

(John 4:9) 
The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.”

(John 4:10) 
Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”

(John 4:11) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?

(John 4:12) 
Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, with his sons and his livestock?”

(John 4:13) 
Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.

(John 4:14) 
The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”

(John 4:15) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”

(John 4:16) 
Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”

(John 4:17) 
The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’:

(John 4:18) 
for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.”

(John 4:19) 
The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.

(John 4:20) 
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”

(John 4:21) 
Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.

(John 4:22) 
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.

(John 4:23) 
But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such to worship him.

(John 4:24) 
God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”

(John 4:25) 
The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.”

(John 4:26) 
Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one speaking to you.”

(John 4:27) 
Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What are you seeking?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”

(John 4:28) 
So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,

(John 4:29) 
“Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”

(John 4:30) 
They went out of the town and were coming to him.

(John 4:31) 
Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”

(John 4:32) 
But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”

(John 4:33) 
So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”

(John 4:34) 
Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.

(John 4:35) 
Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.

(John 4:36) 
Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering crops for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.

(John 4:37) 
For here the saying holds true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’

(John 4:38) 
I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”

(John 4:39) 
Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”

(John 4:40) 
So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.

(John 4:41) 
And many more believed because of his word.

(John 4:42) 
They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”

(John 4:43) 
After the two days he departed for Galilee.

(John 4:44) 
For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.

(John 4:45) 
So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.

(John 4:46) 
So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the wine from water. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.

(John 4:47) 
When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.

(John 4:48) 
So Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”

(John 4:49) 
The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”

(John 4:50) 
Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.

(John 4:51) 
As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering.

(John 4:52) 
So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”

(John 4:53) 
The father knew that it was at that hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And he himself believed, and all his household.

(John 4:54) 
This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.

(John 5:1) 
After these things, there was a feast day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

(John 5:2) 
Now in Jerusalem, there is a pool, the Sheep Pool, which is called Bethsaida in Hebrew, having five porticos.

(John 5:3) 
In these porticos was lying a great multitude of the sick, the blind, the lame, the withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

(John 5:4) 
For an angel of the Lord would descend at certain times into the pool, and the water was moved. And whoever first descended into the pool after the movement of the water was made whole from whatever illness held him.

(John 5:5) 
Now there was a certain man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.

(John 5:6) 
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been ill for a long time, He said to him: “Do you wish to be made whole?”

(John 5:7) 
The sick man answered Him: “Lord, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is moved; for while I am coming, another steps down before me.”

(John 5:8) 
Jesus said to him: “Rise, take up your bed, and walk.”

(John 5:9) 
And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the Sabbath on that day.

(John 5:10) 
The Jews therefore said to him who was healed: “It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”

(John 5:11) 
He answered them: “He who made me whole, He said to me: ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’

(John 5:12) 
They therefore asked him: “Who is that man who said to you: ‘Take up your bed, and walk?’”

(John 5:13) 
But he who had been healed did not know who it was. For Jesus had turned aside from the crowd that was standing in that place.

(John 5:14) 
After these things, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: “Behold, you are made whole; sin no more, lest something worse happen to you.”

(John 5:15) 
The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.

(John 5:16) 
And therefore the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.

(John 5:17) 
But Jesus answered them: “My Father works until now; and I work.”

(John 5:18) 
Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him: because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal to God.

(John 5:19) 
Jesus therefore answered and said to them: “Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing: for whatever He does, these things the Son also does in like manner.”

(John 5:20) 
For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does: and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.

(John 5:21) 
For just as the Father raises the dead, and gives them life: so also the Son gives life to whom He will.

(John 5:22) 
For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,

(John 5:23) 
so that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son, does not honor the Father who sent Him.

(John 5:24) 
Amen, amen, I say to you, that he who hears My word, and believes in Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.

(John 5:25) 
Amen, amen, I say to you, that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who hear will live.

(John 5:26) 
For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He gave to the Son to have life in Himself:

(John 5:27) 
and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.

(John 5:28) 
Do not marvel at this: for the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God.

(John 5:29) 
And those who have done good will come forth to the resurrection of life: but those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

(John 5:30) 
I can do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge: and My judgment is just: because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.

(John 5:31) 
If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.

(John 5:32) 
There is another who bears witness of Me: and I know that the witness which He bears of Me is true.

(John 5:33) 
You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.

(John 5:34) 
But I do not receive testimony from man: but I say these things so that you may be saved.

(John 5:35) 
He was a burning and shining lamp: and you for a time were willing to rejoice in his light.

(John 5:36) 
But I have a greater witness than John: for the works which the Father has given Me to perfect them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.

(John 5:37) 
And the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given testimony of Me: nor have you ever heard His voice, nor have you seen His form.

(John 5:38) 
And you do not have His word abiding in you: for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.

(John 5:39) 
Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life: and it is they that bear witness of Me;

(John 5:40) 
and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.

(John 5:41) 
I do not receive glory from men.

(John 5:42) 
But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.

(John 5:43) 
I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me: if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.

(John 5:44) 
How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from God alone?

(John 5:45) 
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.

(John 5:46) 
For if you believed Moses, perhaps you would believe Me also: for he wrote of Me.

(John 5:47) 
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?

(John 6:1) 
After this, Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.

(John 6:2) 
And a great crowd was following Him, because they were seeing the signs that He was performing on those who were sick.

(John 6:3) 
So Jesus went up into the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.

(John 6:4) 
Now the Passover, a feast day of the Jews, was near.

(John 6:5) 
When Jesus had lifted up His eyes, and saw that a great crowd was coming to Him, He said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?”

(John 6:6) 
Now He was saying this, testing him: for He Himself knew what He would do.

(John 6:7) 
Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each one may take a little.”

(John 6:8) 
One of His disciples, Simon Peter, said to Him:

(John 6:9) 
“There is a young boy here who has five barley loaves and two fishes: but what are these among so many?”

(John 6:10) 
Jesus therefore said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.

(John 6:11) 
Jesus therefore took the loaves: and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those sitting down: likewise also of the fishes, as much as they wanted.

(John 6:12) 
Therefore when they were filled, He said to His disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.”

(John 6:13) 
They gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over from those who had eaten.

(John 6:14) 
Those men therefore, when they had seen what sign Jesus had done, said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”

(John 6:15) 
Jesus, when He knew that they would come to seize Him and make Him king, fled again into the mountain by Himself alone.

(John 6:16) 
When evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea:

(John 6:17) 
And when they had entered into a boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum: and now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.

(John 6:18) 
And the sea was rising because a great wind was blowing.

(John 6:19) 
When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea, and approaching the boat: and they were afraid.

(John 6:20) 
He said to them therefore, “It is I, do not be afraid.”

(John 6:21) 
They wished therefore to take Him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.

(John 6:22) 
The next day the crowd that was standing across the sea saw that there was only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone:

(John 6:23) 
And other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, giving thanks to the Lord.

(John 6:24) 
Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they went into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.

(John 6:25) 
And when they had found Him across the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”

(John 6:26) 
Jesus answered them and said, “Amen, amen I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.”

(John 6:27) 
“Labor not for the food that perishes, but for that which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For Him the Father, God, has sealed.”

(John 6:28) 
They said therefore to Him, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”

(John 6:29) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in Him Whom He has sent.”

(John 6:30) 
They said therefore to Him, “What sign then do You do, that we may see, and believe You? What do You work?”

(John 6:31) 
“Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from the sky to eat.’”

(John 6:32) 
Jesus therefore said to them: “Amen, amen I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from the sky; but My Father gives you the true bread from the sky.

(John 6:33) 
“For the bread of God is He Who comes down from the sky, and gives life to the world.”

(John 6:34) 
They said therefore to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”

(John 6:35) 
And Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall not hunger: and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.”

(John 6:36) 
“But I said to you that you have also seen Me, and you do not believe.

(John 6:37) 
“All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me; and him who comes to Me I will not cast out.

(John 6:38) 
“For I have come down from the sky, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me.”

(John 6:39) 
“Now this is the will of Him Who sent Me: that of all that He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again on the last day.

(John 6:40) 
“For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life: and I will raise him up on the last day.”

(John 6:41) 
The Jews therefore were murmuring about Him, because He had said, “I am the living bread, Who came down from the sky.”

(John 6:42) 
And they were saying, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does He say, ‘I have come down from the sky’?”

(John 6:43) 
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves.

(John 6:44) 
“No one can come to Me, unless the Father, Who sent Me, draws him: and I will raise him up on the last day.

(John 6:45) 
“It is written in the prophets: ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ Everyone who has heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.

(John 6:46) 
“Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He Who is from God, He has seen the Father.

(John 6:47) 
“Amen, amen I say to you: he who believes in Me has eternal life.

(John 6:48) 
“I am the bread of life.

(John 6:49) 
“Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and they died.

(John 6:50) 
“This is the bread that comes down from the sky, so that if anyone eats of it, he will not die.

(John 6:51) 
“I am the living bread, Who came down from the sky.

(John 6:52) 
“If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, for the life of the world.”

(John 6:53) 
The Jews therefore began to quarrel among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”

(John 6:54) 
Jesus therefore said to them: “Amen, amen I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in yourselves.

(John 6:55) 
“He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life: and I will raise him up on the last day.

(John 6:56) 
“For My flesh is truly food: and My blood is truly drink.

(John 6:57) 
“He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood, abides in Me, and I in him.

(John 6:58) 
“As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father: and he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.

(John 6:59) 
“This is the bread that came down from the sky. Not as your fathers ate, and died. He who eats this bread shall live forever.”

(John 6:60) 
These things He said as He was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.

(John 6:61) 
Many therefore of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, “This is a hard saying: and who can hear it?”

(John 6:62) 
But Jesus, knowing within Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, “Does this scandalize you?

(John 6:63) 
“What if you shall see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?

(John 6:64) 
“It is the Spirit that gives life: but the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

(John 6:65) 
“But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who were believing, and who would betray Him.

(John 6:66) 
And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been given to him by My Father.”

(John 6:67) 
From this time many of His disciples went back: and they were no longer walking with Him.

(John 6:68) 
Jesus therefore said to the twelve: “Do you also want to go away?”

(John 6:69) 
Simon Peter therefore answered Him: “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.

(John 6:70) 
“And we believe and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

(John 6:71) 
Jesus answered them: “Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil.”

(John 7:1) 
After this, Jesus was staying in Galilee, because He didn't want to travel in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.

(John 7:2) 
Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.

(John 7:3) 
His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also can see the works you are doing.

(John 7:4) 
For nobody does anything in secret while seeking to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”

(John 7:5) 
For not even His brothers believed in Him.

(John 7:6) 
Then Jesus said to them: “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.”

(John 7:7) 
The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I bear witness of it, that its works are evil.

(John 7:8) 
Go up to this feast. I am not going up to this feast, because My time is not yet fulfilled.”

(John 7:9) 
After saying this, He remained in Galilee.

(John 7:10) 
But after His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as if in secret.

(John 7:11) 
The Jews therefore were looking for Him at the feast, and they were saying, “Where is He?”

(John 7:12) 
And there was a great murmuring about Him among the crowds. For some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “No, but He deceives the crowd.”

(John 7:13) 
Yet no one spoke openly about Him, for fear of the Jews.

(John 7:14) 
But when the feast was now half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.

(John 7:15) 
And the Jews were marveling, saying, “How does this man know letters, not having learned?”

(John 7:16) 
Jesus answered them and said: “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.

(John 7:17) 
If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak from Myself.

(John 7:18) 
The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.

(John 7:19) 
Did not Moses give you the law? And yet none of you keeps the law.

(John 7:20) 
Why are you seeking to kill Me?”

(John 7:21) 
The crowd answered, “You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?”

(John 7:22) 
Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel.

(John 7:23) 
For this reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.

(John 7:24) 
If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?

(John 7:25) 
Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”

(John 7:26) 
Therefore some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is not this the man whom they are seeking to kill?

(John 7:27) 
And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers really come to know that this is truly the Christ?

(John 7:28) 
But we know where this man is from, but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.”

(John 7:29) 
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know Me and know where I am from, and I have not come from Myself, but the One who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.

(John 7:30) 
I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.”

(John 7:31) 
Therefore they were seeking to arrest Him, and no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.

(John 7:32) 
But many of the crowd believed in Him, and they were saying, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than this man has done?”

(John 7:33) 
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.

(John 7:34) 
Jesus therefore said, “For a little while longer I am with you, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.

(John 7:35) 
You will seek Me, and will not find Me, and where I am, you cannot come.”

(John 7:36) 
Therefore the Jews said to one another, “Where is this man going that we will not find Him? Will He go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

(John 7:37) 
What is this statement that He said, ‘You will seek Me, and will not find Me, and where I am, you cannot come’?”

(John 7:38) 
On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.

(John 7:39) 
Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’

(John 7:40) 
But He spoke this concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him were to receive, for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.

(John 7:41) 
Therefore some of the crowd, when they heard this statement, were saying, “This is truly the Prophet.”

(John 7:42) 
Others were saying, “This is the Christ.” But others were saying, “Surely the Christ does not come from Galilee, does He?

(John 7:43) 
Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”

(John 7:44) 
So there was a division in the crowd because of Him.

(John 7:45) 
Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid hands on Him.

(John 7:46) 
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why did you not bring Him?”

(John 7:47) 
The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks!”

(John 7:48) 
The Pharisees answered them, “Are you also deceived?

(John 7:49) 
Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in Him?

(John 7:50) 
But this crowd, which does not know the law, is accursed.”

(John 7:51) 
Nicodemus, who had come to Him before, and who was one of them, said, “Does our law judge a man before it hears from him and knows what he is doing?”

(John 7:52) 
They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.”

(John 7:53) 
And everyone went to his home.

(John 8:1) 
Jesus then went towards the Mount of Olives.

(John 8:2) 
And in the early morning, Jesus came back to the Temple, and the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.

(John 8:3) 
But the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and they put her in the middle.

(John 8:4) 
They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.”

(John 8:5) 
Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do you say?”

(John 8:6) 
They were saying this to test Him, so that they might be able to accuse Him. But Jesus bent down and with His finger wrote on the ground.

(John 8:7) 
So when they continued asking Him, He straightened up and said to them: “Let the one of you who is without sin cast the first stone at her.”

(John 8:8) 
And again, He bent down and wrote on the ground.

(John 8:9) 
But when they heard this, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.

(John 8:10) 
When Jesus straightened up, He said to her: “Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?”

(John 8:11) 
She said: “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said: “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and sin no more.”

(John 8:12) 
Jesus spoke to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. The one who follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

(John 8:13) 
So the Pharisees said to Him: “You are bearing witness about Yourself; Your testimony is not true.”

(John 8:14) 
Jesus answered and said to them: “Even if I bear witness about Myself, My testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.

(John 8:15) 
You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.

(John 8:16) 
And if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.

(John 8:17) 
And in your law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.

(John 8:18) 
I am the one who bears witness about Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness about Me.”

(John 8:19) 
So they were saying to Him: “Where is Your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would have known My Father also.”

(John 8:20) 
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, while He was teaching in the Temple. And no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.

(John 8:21) 
Then Jesus said to them again: “I am going away, and you will seek Me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”

(John 8:22) 
So the Jews were saying: “Is He going to kill Himself, because He said, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”

(John 8:23) 
And He said to them: “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.”

(John 8:24) 
Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.”

(John 8:25) 
So they were saying to Him: “Who are You?” Jesus said to them: “I AM, that is also what I am telling you.”

(John 8:26) 
“I have many things to say and to judge about you; but the One who sent Me is true, and the things that I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.”

(John 8:27) 
They did not understand that He was speaking to them about the Father.

(John 8:28) 
So Jesus said to them: “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing on My own, but I speak these things just as the Father taught Me.”

(John 8:29) 
And the One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.”

(John 8:30) 
As He spoke these things, many believed in Him.

(John 8:31) 
So Jesus was saying to the Jews who had believed in Him: “If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples.

(John 8:32) 
And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

(John 8:33) 
They answered Him: “We are Abraham’s descendants, and we have never been slaves to anyone. How do You say, ‘You will be set free’?”

(John 8:34) 
Jesus answered them: “Amen, amen I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.

(John 8:35) 
Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.

(John 8:36) 
So if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.

(John 8:37) 
I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.

(John 8:38) 
I speak the things that I have seen with My Father, and you do the things that you have heard from your father.”

(John 8:39) 
They answered and said to Him: “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them: “If you are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham.

(John 8:40) 
But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.

(John 8:41) 
You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him: “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.”

(John 8:42) 
So Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I did not come on My own, but He sent Me.

(John 8:43) 
Why do you not understand what I say? Because you cannot hear My word.

(John 8:44) 
You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

(John 8:45) 
But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.

(John 8:46) 
Which of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?

(John 8:47) 
He who is from God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear, because you are not from God.”

(John 8:48) 
The Jews answered Him and said: “Are we not right in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?”

(John 8:49) 
Jesus answered: “I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.

(John 8:50) 
I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.

(John 8:51) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”

(John 8:52) 
So the Jews said to Him: “Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets also; and You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death.’

(John 8:53) 
Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets also died. Who do You make Yourself out to be?”

(John 8:54) 
Jesus answered: “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’

(John 8:55) 
You have not known Him, but I know Him. If I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar. But I know Him and I keep His word.

(John 8:56) 
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.”

(John 8:57) 
So the Jews said to Him: “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?”

(John 8:58) 
Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.”

(John 8:59) 
Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the Temple.

(John 9:1) 
As He was walking, Jesus saw a man who had been blind from birth.

(John 9:2) 
And His disciples asked Him: "Teacher, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"

(John 9:3) 
Jesus answered: "Neither this man sinned, nor his parents, but the work of God should be manifested in him."

(John 9:4) 
I must do the works of Him who sent Me, while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work.

(John 9:5) 
As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.

(John 9:6) 
Having said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the spittle and spread the clay on the blind man's eyes,

(John 9:7) 
and said to him: "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means, "Sent"). Then he went and washed, and came seeing.

(John 9:8) 
Therefore the neighbors and those who had seen him before when he was begging said: "Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?"

(John 9:9) 
Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am he."

(John 9:10) 
Then they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?"

(John 9:11) 
He answered, "The Man called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: 'Go to Siloam, and wash.' And I went and washed, and I saw."

(John 9:12) 
They said to him, "Where is He?" He said, "I don't know."

(John 9:13) 
They brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.

(John 9:14) 
And it was the Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

(John 9:15) 
Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."

(John 9:16) 
Some of the Pharisees then said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a sinner do such signs?" And there was a division among them.

(John 9:17) 
Then they said again to the blind man, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?"

(John 9:18) 
He answered, "He is a prophet."

(John 9:19) 
Then the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and received sight until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.

(John 9:20) 
And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"

(John 9:21) 
His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he has come of age; let him speak for himself."

(John 9:22) 
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess that He was the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.

(John 9:23) 
For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."

(John 9:24) 
So they called the man who had been blind again and said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner."

(John 9:25) 
Then he answered and said, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see."

(John 9:26) 
Then they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"

(John 9:27) 
He answered them, "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?"

(John 9:28) 
Then they reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.

(John 9:29) 
We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this Man, we do not know where He is from."

(John 9:30) 
The man answered and said to them, "This is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!

(John 9:31) 
Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him.

(John 9:32) 
Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.

(John 9:33) 
If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing."

(John 9:34) 
They answered and said to him, "You were altogether born in sin, and are you teaching us?" And they cast him out.

(John 9:35) 
Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when He had found him, He said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"

(John 9:36) 
He answered and said, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"

(John 9:37) 
And Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is speaking with you."

(John 9:38) 
And he said, "Lord, I believe!" And he worshiped Him.

(John 9:39) 
And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."

(John 9:40) 
Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, "Are we also blind?"

(John 9:41) 
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains."

(John 10:1) 
I assure you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate but climbs in another way, he is a thief and a robber.

(John 10:2) 
But he who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

(John 10:3) 
To him the gatekeeper opens. And the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

(John 10:4) 
And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.

(John 10:5) 
A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.

(John 10:6) 
This proverb Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

(John 10:7) 
Jesus therefore said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep.

(John 10:8) 
All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

(John 10:9) 
I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.

(John 10:10) 
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.

(John 10:11) 
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

(John 10:12) 
The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf attacks them and scatters them.

(John 10:13) 
The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

(John 10:14) 
I am the good shepherd. I know my own sheep, and they know me,

(John 10:15) 
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.

(John 10:16) 
And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.

(John 10:17) 
For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.

(John 10:18) 
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”

(John 10:19) 
There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.

(John 10:20) 
Many of them were saying, “He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?”

(John 10:21) 
Others said, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

(John 10:22) 
At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,

(John 10:23) 
and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon.

(John 10:24) 
So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”

(John 10:25) 
Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,

(John 10:26) 
but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.

(John 10:27) 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

(John 10:28) 
I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

(John 10:29) 
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.

(John 10:30) 
I and the Father are one.”

(John 10:31) 
The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.

(John 10:32) 
Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”

(John 10:33) 
The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”

(John 10:34) 
Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I said, you are gods’?

(John 10:35) 
If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—

(John 10:36) 
do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?

(John 10:37) 
If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;

(John 10:38) 
but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”

(John 10:39) 
Again they were seeking to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.

(John 10:40) 
He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and there he remained.

(John 10:41) 
And many came to him. They said, “John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”

(John 10:42) 
And many there believed in him.

(John 11:1) 
There was a sick man: Lazarus, who was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

(John 11:2) 
Now Mary was the one who had poured perfume on the Lord and dried His feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was sick.

(John 11:3) 
So the sisters sent a message to Jesus saying, "Lord, the one You love is sick."

(John 11:4) 
When Jesus heard this, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."

(John 11:5) 
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.

(John 11:6) 
So, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained for two more days in the place where He was.

(John 11:7) 
Then after that, He said to His disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."

(John 11:8) 
The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"

(John 11:9) 
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.

(John 11:10) 
But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."

(John 11:11) 
These things He said; and after that He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I am going to awaken him."

(John 11:12) 
Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well."

(John 11:13) 
However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about the repose of sleep.

(John 11:14) 
Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead."

(John 11:15) 
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. But let us go to him."

(John 11:16) 
Then Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him."

(John 11:17) 
So Jesus came and found that he had already been in the tomb for four days.

(John 11:18) 
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.

(John 11:19) 
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.

(John 11:20) 
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary remained in the house.

(John 11:21) 
Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

(John 11:22) 
But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."

(John 11:23) 
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

(John 11:24) 
Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."

(John 11:25) 
Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me, though he may die, he will live.

(John 11:26) 
And whoever lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?"

(John 11:27) 
She said to Him, "Yes, Lord. I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world."

(John 11:28) 
And when she had said this, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The Master is here and is calling for you."

(John 11:29) 
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him.

(John 11:30) 
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.

(John 11:31) 
Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.

(John 11:32) 
Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."

(John 11:33) 
Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.

(John 11:34) 
and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to Him, "Lord, come and see."

(John 11:35) 
Jesus wept.

(John 11:36) 
Then the Jews said, "See how He loved him!"

(John 11:37) 
But some of them said, "Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also kept this man from dying?"

(John 11:38) 
Then Jesus, again deeply moved within Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.

(John 11:39) 
Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."

(John 11:40) 
Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you would believe, you would see the glory of God?"

(John 11:41) 
So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.

(John 11:42) 
And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said it, that they may believe that You sent Me."

(John 11:43) 
Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"

(John 11:44) 
And the dead man came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let him go."

(John 11:45) 
Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him.

(John 11:46) 
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus had done.

(John 11:47) 
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, "What are we doing? For this Man works many signs.

(John 11:48) 
If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."

(John 11:49) 
And one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,

(John 11:50) 
nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."

(John 11:51) 
Now this he did not say on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,

(John 11:52) 
and not for the nation only, but that He might also gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.

(John 11:53) 
Therefore, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death.

(John 11:54) 
So Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with His disciples.

(John 11:55) 
And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.

(John 11:56) 
Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves in the temple, "What do you think—that He will not come to the feast?"

(John 11:57) 
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might arrest Him.

(John 12:1) 
Six days before Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

(John 12:2) 
They prepared a meal for him there, and Martha was serving them, while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with Him.

(John 12:3) 
Mary took a pound of pure, costly nard perfume, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and dried his feet with her hair. The house then was filled with the sweet scent of the perfume.

(John 12:4) 
Then, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray him, said,

(John 12:5) 
“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”

(John 12:6) 
He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money bag, he was taking what was put into it.

(John 12:7) 
So Jesus said: “Let her alone, so she may keep this for the day of my burial. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”

(John 12:8) 
Then, a large crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.

(John 12:9) 
But the chief priests then planned to kill Lazarus too,

(John 12:10) 
because, because of him, many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus.

(John 12:11) 
The next day, the large crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

(John 12:12) 
took palm branches and went out to meet him, and they were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”

(John 12:13) 
Jesus found a donkey and sat on it, as it is written:

(John 12:14) 
“Do not fear, daughter of Zion: behold, your King comes, sitting on a colt of a donkey.”

(John 12:15) 
His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and they had done these things for him.

(John 12:16) 
The crowd that was with him then testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead.

(John 12:17) 
For this reason, the crowd went out to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.

(John 12:18) 
Then the Pharisees said to one another, “Do you see that we are accomplishing nothing? Behold, the whole world has gone after him.”

(John 12:19) 
Now there were some Greeks among those who had gone up to worship at the feast.

(John 12:20) 
These approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they were asking him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”

(John 12:21) 
Philip came and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

(John 12:22) 
Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

(John 12:23) 
Amen, amen, I say to you: unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

(John 12:24) 
Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world keeps it to eternal life.

(John 12:25) 
If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

(John 12:26) 
Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? “Father, save me from this hour.” But for this reason I have come to this hour.

(John 12:27) 
Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”

(John 12:28) 
So the crowd that stood there and heard it was saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”

(John 12:29) 
Jesus answered and said: “This voice did not come for my sake, but for yours.

(John 12:30) 
Now is the judgment of the world; now the prince of this world shall be cast out.

(John 12:31) 
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.”

(John 12:32) 
He said this, signifying by what kind of death he was going to die.

(John 12:33) 
Then the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that Christ remains forever. And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”

(John 12:34) 
Jesus then said to them: “For a little while longer, the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you, and whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.

(John 12:35) 
While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.” Jesus spoke these words, and he went away and hid himself from them.

(John 12:36) 
Although he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:

(John 12:37) 
so that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which he said: “Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”

(John 12:38) 
Therefore, they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:

(John 12:39) 
“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they might not see with their eyes, understand with their heart, and turn back, and I heal them.”

(John 12:40) 
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke about him.

(John 12:41) 
Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess him, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.

(John 12:42) 
For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.

(John 12:43) 
Then Jesus cried out and said: “He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.

(John 12:44) 
And he who sees me sees him who sent me.

(John 12:45) 
I have come as light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness.

(John 12:46) 
And if anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him, because I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

(John 12:47) 
Whoever rejects me and does not receive my words has one who judges him. The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.

(John 12:48) 
For I have not spoken on my own, but the Father who sent me has given me a commandment about what I should say and what I should speak.

(John 12:49) 
And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore, what I speak, I speak as the Father has told me.”

(John 13:1) 
Before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. And because He had loved his own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end.

(John 13:2) 
And when supper was finished, since the devil had already put it in the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Him,

(John 13:3) 
Jesus knew that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that He had come from God and was going back to God,

(John 13:4) 
He rose from supper, and laid aside his garments; and having taken a towel, He girded himself.

(John 13:5) 
Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.

(John 13:6) 
Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”

(John 13:7) 
Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know it hereafter.”

(John 13:8) 
Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.”

(John 13:9) 
Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.”

(John 13:10) 
Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”

(John 13:11) 
Jesus said to him, “He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is clean all over. And you are clean, but not all.”

(John 13:12) 
For He knew who it was that would betray Him; that is why He said, “You are not all clean.”

(John 13:13) 
When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?”

(John 13:14) 
“You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right; for so I am.”

(John 13:15) 
“If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.”

(John 13:16) 
“For I have given you an example, so that you also should do as I have done to you.”

(John 13:17) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.”

(John 13:18) 
“If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.”

(John 13:19) 
“I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’”

(John 13:20) 
“I tell you this now, before it happens, that when it does happen you may believe that I am he.”

(John 13:21) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”

(John 13:22) 
When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”

(John 13:23) 
The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he was speaking.

(John 13:24) 
One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table in Jesus' bosom.

(John 13:25) 
So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask who it was of whom he spoke.

(John 13:26) 
Then leaning back on Jesus' breast, he said to him, “Lord, who is it?”

(John 13:27) 
Jesus answered, “It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it.” So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

(John 13:28) 
After the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.”

(John 13:29) 
Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.

(John 13:30) 
Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.

(John 13:31) 
So, after receiving the morsel, he immediately went out. And it was night.

(John 13:32) 
When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.”

(John 13:33) 
“If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him at once.”

(John 13:34) 
“Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.”

(John 13:35) 
“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”

(John 13:36) 
“By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

(John 13:37) 
Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you will follow afterwards.”

(John 13:38) 
Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”

(John 13:39) 
Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times.”

(John 14:1) 
Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God, so believe also in me.

(John 14:2) 
My Father's house has many rooms. If it were otherwise, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?

(John 14:3) 
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also.

(John 14:4) 
And you know the way where I am going.

(John 14:5) 
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?”

(John 14:6) 
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

(John 14:7) 
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”

(John 14:8) 
Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.”

(John 14:9) 
Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

(John 14:10) 
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.

(John 14:11) 
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.

(John 14:12) 
“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do, and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.

(John 14:13) 
Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

(John 14:14) 
If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

(John 14:15) 
“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

(John 14:16) 
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,

(John 14:17) 
even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

(John 14:18) 
“I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.

(John 14:19) 
Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.

(John 14:20) 
In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

(John 14:21) 
Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”

(John 14:22) 
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”

(John 14:23) 
Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.

(John 14:24) 
Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.

(John 14:25) 
“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you.

(John 14:26) 
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

(John 14:27) 
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, nor let them be afraid.

(John 14:28) 
You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

(John 14:29) 
And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe.

(John 14:30) 
I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. And he has nothing in me.

(John 14:31) 
But I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise up, let us go from here.

(John 15:1) 
I am the true vine, and My Father is the farmer.

(John 15:2) 
He cuts off every branch in Me that doesn't produce fruit. And the branches that bear fruit, He prunes so that it may produce more.

(John 15:3) 
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

(John 15:4) 
Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. A branch cannot bear fruit by itself, it must remain in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me.

(John 15:5) 
I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me and I in them produce much fruit, because apart from Me you can do nothing.

(John 15:6) 
If anyone does not remain in Me, they are thrown outside like a branch and wither. Such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.

(John 15:7) 
If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, you can ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

(John 15:8) 
My Father is glorified in this: that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.

(John 15:9) 
As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.

(John 15:10) 
If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love.

(John 15:11) 
I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.

(John 15:12) 
This is My commandment: that you love one another, as I have loved you.

(John 15:13) 
No one has greater love than this: that they lay down their life for their friends.

(John 15:14) 
You are My friends if you do what I command you.

(John 15:15) 
I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from My Father.

(John 15:16) 
You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.

(John 15:17) 
This I command you: that you love one another.

(John 15:18) 
If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you.

(John 15:19) 
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.

(John 15:20) 
Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.

(John 15:21) 
But they will do all these things to you on account of My name, because they do not know the One who sent Me.

(John 15:22) 
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

(John 15:23) 
Those who hate Me, hate My Father also.

(John 15:24) 
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and they hate both Me and My Father.

(John 15:25) 
But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their law: 'They hated Me without cause.'

(John 15:26) 
When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about Me.

(John 15:27) 
And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.

(John 16:1) 
I have told you these things so that you do not lose faith.

(John 16:2) 
They will cast you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.

(John 16:3) 
They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor Me.

(John 16:4) 
But I have told you these things so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them.

(John 16:5) 
I did not tell you these things at the beginning, because I was with you.

(John 16:6) 
Now, I am going to the One Who sent Me, and yet not one of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'

(John 16:7) 
But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.

(John 16:8) 
But I tell you the truth: It is better for you that I go, for if I do not go, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you.

(John 16:9) 
And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment:

(John 16:10) 
concerning sin, because they have not believed in Me;

(John 16:11) 
concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see Me no more;

(John 16:12) 
and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

(John 16:13) 
I still have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now.

(John 16:14) 
But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak, and He will declare to you the things that are to come.

(John 16:15) 
He will glorify Me, because He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.

(John 16:16) 
All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He will take what is Mine and declare it to you.

(John 16:17) 
A little while, and you will see Me no longer, and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I am going to the Father.

(John 16:18) 
Some of His disciples then said to one another, “What does He mean by this that He says to us, ‘A little while, and you will see Me no longer,’ and, ‘Again a little while, and you will see Me,’ and, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”

(John 16:19) 
So they were saying, “What does He mean by ‘a little while’? We do not know what He is talking about.”

(John 16:20) 
Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him, and He said to them, “Are you discussing this among yourselves, that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me’?

(John 16:21) 
Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.

(John 16:22) 
When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she has given birth to the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.

(John 16:23) 
So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.

(John 16:24) 
In that day, you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you.

(John 16:25) 
Until now, you have not asked for anything in My name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.

(John 16:26) 
I have spoken to you these things in figures of speech; the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly of the Father.

(John 16:27) 
In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;

(John 16:28) 
for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.

(John 16:29) 
I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.

(John 16:30) 
His disciples said, “Now You are speaking plainly and not using any figure of speech.

(John 16:31) 
Now we know that You know all things and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God.

(John 16:32) 
Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?

(John 16:33) 
Behold, the hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered, each to his own home, and to leave Me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

(John 16:34) 
I have said these things to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

(John 17:1) 
After Jesus said these things, He looked up to the universe and said, “Father, the time has come! Glorify Your Son, so that Your Son can glorify You.

(John 17:2) 
You have already given Him authority over all people, so that He might give eternal life to all those whom You have given to Him.

(John 17:3) 
This is eternal life: that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You sent on a mission.

(John 17:4) 
I have glorified You on the earth, by accomplishing the work that You gave Me to do.

(John 17:5) 
And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence, with the glory that I had with You before the universe existed.

(John 17:6) 
I have revealed Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.

(John 17:7) 
Now they know that everything You have given Me comes from You.

(John 17:8) 
For I have given them the words that You gave Me, and they have received them and truly understood that I came from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.

(John 17:9) 
I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom You have given Me, because they are Yours.

(John 17:10) 
All My things are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.

(John 17:11) 
I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, those whom You have given Me, so that they may be one, as We are.

(John 17:12) 
While I was with them, I kept them in Your name. I guarded those whom You gave Me, and not one of them has been lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

(John 17:13) 
But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.

(John 17:14) 
I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

(John 17:15) 
I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should protect them from evil.

(John 17:16) 
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

(John 17:17) 
Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth.

(John 17:18) 
As You sent Me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.

(John 17:19) 
And for their sakes, I sanctify Myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth.

(John 17:20) 
I do not pray for these only, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word,

(John 17:21) 
that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, so that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.

(John 17:22) 
And I have given them the glory that You have given Me, so that they may be one, just as We are one.

(John 17:23) 
I in them, and You in Me, so that they may be perfected in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me and that You have loved them, as You have loved Me.

(John 17:24) 
Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory that You have given Me, because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

(John 17:25) 
O righteous Father, the world has not known You, but I have known You, and these have known that You sent Me.

(John 17:26) 
And I have made Your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”

(John 18:1) 
After Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples across the river of Kidron. Where there was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.

(John 18:2) 
Now Judas, who was betraying him, knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples.

(John 18:3) 
Then Judas, having received a cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.

(John 18:4) 
Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would happen to him, went forth and said to them, "Whom are you seeking?"

(John 18:5) 
They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am." And Judas, who was betraying him, was standing with them.

(John 18:6) 
When therefore he said to them, "I am," they went backward and fell to the ground.

(John 18:7) 
Again therefore he asked them, "Whom are you seeking?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."

(John 18:8) 
Jesus answered, "I told you that I am. If therefore you are seeking me, let these go their way."

(John 18:9) 
That the word might be fulfilled which he said: "I have not lost any of those whom you gave me."

(John 18:10) 
Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.

(John 18:11) 
Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"

(John 18:12) 
Then the cohort, the tribune, and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus,

(John 18:13) 
and bound him: and they led him to Annas first, for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.

(John 18:14) 
Now Caiaphas was he who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

(John 18:15) 
And Simon Peter was following Jesus, and another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.

(John 18:16) 
But Peter was standing at the door outside. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who kept the door, and brought Peter in.

(John 18:17) 
Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you not also one of this man’s disciples?"

(John 18:18) 
He said, "I am not."

(John 18:19) 
Now the servants and the officers were standing at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

(John 18:20) 
The high priest therefore questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.

(John 18:21) 
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have spoken nothing.

(John 18:22) 
Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I have spoken to them. Behold, they know what things I have said."

(John 18:23) 
And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with a slap, saying, "Do you answer the high priest so?"

(John 18:24) 
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?"

(John 18:25) 
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

(John 18:26) 
And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "Are you not also one of his disciples?"

(John 18:27) 
He denied it and said, "I am not."

(John 18:28) 
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was morning; and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.

(John 18:29) 
Pilate therefore went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"

(John 18:30) 
They answered and said to him, "If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him to you."

(John 18:31) 
Then Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." The Jews said therefore to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."

(John 18:32) 
That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying by what death he would die.

(John 18:33) 
Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

(John 18:34) 
Jesus answered, "Do you say this of yourself, or have others told you about me?"

(John 18:35) 
Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?"

(John 18:36) 
Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."

(John 18:37) 
Pilate therefore said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."

(John 18:38) 
Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find in him no crime at all."

(John 18:39) 
But it is your custom that I should release one to you at the Passover. Will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?"

(John 18:40) 
Then they cried out again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.

(John 19:1) 
Then Pilate had Jesus flogged.

(John 19:2) 
And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns, placed it on his head, and dressed him in a purple robe.

(John 19:3) 
They approached him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck him.

(John 19:4) 
Pilate went outside again and said to them, "I am bringing him out to you so you may know that I find no fault in him."

(John 19:5) 
Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"

(John 19:6) 
When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no fault in him."

(John 19:7) 
The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."

(John 19:8) 
When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid.

(John 19:9) 
He entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.

(John 19:10) 
So Pilate said to him, "Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and power to crucify you?"

(John 19:11) 
Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."

(John 19:12) 
From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."

(John 19:13) 
When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

(John 19:14) 
It was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about noon. Pilate said to the Jews, "Here is your king!"

(John 19:15) 
They shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."

(John 19:16) 
So he handed him over to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.

(John 19:17) 
Bearing his own cross, he went out to the place called the Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

(John 19:18) 
There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.

(John 19:19) 
Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."

(John 19:20) 
Many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

(John 19:21) 
So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write 'King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.'"

(John 19:22) 
Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."

(John 19:23) 
When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. The tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.

(John 19:24) 
So they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be," so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots." This is what the soldiers did.

(John 19:25) 
Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

(John 19:26) 
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"

(John 19:27) 
Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.

(John 19:28) 
After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said, to fulfill the scripture, "I am thirsty."

(John 19:29) 
A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.

(John 19:30) 
When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, "It is finished." And bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.

(John 19:31) 
The Jews therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

(John 19:32) 
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.

(John 19:33) 
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.

(John 19:34) 
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.

(John 19:35) 
He who saw it has borne witness, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, so that you also may believe.

(John 19:36) 
For these things happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled: "Not a bone of him will be broken."

(John 19:37) 
And again another scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."

(John 19:38) 
After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.

(John 19:39) 
Nicodemus also came, the one who had first come to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.

(John 19:40) 
So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.

(John 19:41) 
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.

(John 19:42) 
So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

(John 20:1) 
On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark. And she saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.

(John 20:2) 
She ran to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”

(John 20:3) 
Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.

(John 20:4) 
And they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.

(John 20:5) 
And stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.

(John 20:6) 
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. And he saw the linen cloths lying,

(John 20:7) 
and the napkin that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself.

(John 20:8) 
Then the other disciple, who had come first to the tomb, also went in, and he saw and believed.

(John 20:9) 
For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.

(John 20:10) 
Then the disciples went back to their homes.

(John 20:11) 
But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb,

(John 20:12) 
and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.

(John 20:13) 
And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”

(John 20:14) 
Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

(John 20:15) 
Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”

(John 20:16) 
Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).

(John 20:17) 
Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”

(John 20:18) 
Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he had said these things to her.

(John 20:19) 
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them, and said to them, “Peace be with you.”

(John 20:20) 
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.

(John 20:21) 
Jesus therefore said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.”

(John 20:22) 
And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.

(John 20:23) 
If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”

(John 20:24) 
Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.

(John 20:25) 
So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”

(John 20:26) 
Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being closed, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace be with you.”

(John 20:27) 
Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.”

(John 20:28) 
Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”

(John 20:29) 
Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

(John 20:30) 
Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;

(John 20:31) 
but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

(John 21:1) 
After these things, Jesus again showed himself to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and he showed himself in this way.

(John 21:2) 
Simon Peter was present, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.

(John 21:3) 
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We are coming with you." They went out and entered the boat, and that night they caught nothing.

(John 21:4) 
But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

(John 21:5) 
Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you any meat?" They answered him, "No."

(John 21:6) 
He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find." They cast it therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

(John 21:7) 
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord." Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girded his tunic about him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.

(John 21:8) 
But the other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits), drawing the net of fishes.

(John 21:9) 
When therefore they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

(John 21:10) 
Jesus said to them, "Bring of the fishes which you have now caught."

(John 21:11) 
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.

(John 21:12) 
Jesus says to them, "Come and dine." And none of those who were reclining dared to ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.

(John 21:13) 
And Jesus came, and took bread, and gave to them, and fish in like manner. This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.

(John 21:14) 
When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my lambs."

(John 21:15) 
He says to him again, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my lambs."

(John 21:16) 
He says to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." He says to him, "Feed my sheep."

(John 21:17) 
Amen, amen I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself, and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch forth your hands, and another will gird you, and lead you where you do not want to go."

(John 21:18) 
Now he said this, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he says to him, "Follow me."

(John 21:19) 
Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, "Lord, who is he that betrays you?"

(John 21:20) 
Peter therefore seeing him, says to Jesus, "Lord, and what of this man?"

(John 21:21) 
Jesus says to him, "So I will have him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."

(John 21:22) 
This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him, "He shall not die"; but, "So I will have him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"

(John 21:23) 
This is the disciple who gives testimony of these things, and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.

(John 21:24) 
But there are also many other things which Jesus did; which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.

(Acts 1:1) 
My first account, O Theophilus, described everything that Jesus began to do and to teach,

(Acts 1:2) 
until the very day when, after giving instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen through the Holy Spirit, he was taken up to Heaven.

(Acts 1:3) 
To them he also presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

(Acts 1:4) 
And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me;

(Acts 1:5) 
for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”

(Acts 1:6) 
So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”

(Acts 1:7) 
He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.

(Acts 1:8) 
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”

(Acts 1:9) 
And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.

(Acts 1:10) 
And as they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,

(Acts 1:11) 
and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”

(Acts 1:12) 
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.

(Acts 1:13) 
And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.

(Acts 1:14) 
All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

(Acts 1:15) 
In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,

(Acts 1:16) 
“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.

(Acts 1:17) 
For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.”

(Acts 1:18) 
Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.

(Acts 1:19) 
And it became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.

(Acts 1:20) 
For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and ‘May another take his office.’

(Acts 1:21) 
So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

(Acts 1:22) 
beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us—one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.”

(Acts 1:23) 
And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.

(Acts 1:24) 
And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen

(Acts 1:25) 
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”

(Acts 1:26) 
And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to the eleven apostles.

(Acts 2:1) 
When the day of Pentecost arrived, everyone was together in the same place:

(Acts 2:2) 
Then, suddenly, there was a sound that came from the sky, like a rushing, violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.

(Acts 2:3) 
Tongues, divided like flames of fire, appeared to them, and settled on each of them.

(Acts 2:4) 
All were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages, as the Holy Spirit enabled them to speak.

(Acts 2:5) 
Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under the sky.

(Acts 2:6) 
At this sound, a crowd gathered and was confused, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.

(Acts 2:7) 
They were astonished and amazed, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?

(Acts 2:8) 
“And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?

(Acts 2:9) 
Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and the residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,

(Acts 2:10) 
Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the regions of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,

(Acts 2:11) 
both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs; we hear them speaking about the great works of God in our own tongues.”

(Acts 2:12) 
All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”

(Acts 2:13) 
But others, mocking, said, “They are filled with sweet wine.”

(Acts 2:14) 
Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words:

(Acts 2:15) 
“For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.

(Acts 2:16) 
“No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:

(Acts 2:17) 
‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.

(Acts 2:18) 
‘Even on my male servants and female servants in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.

(Acts 2:19) 
‘And I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below: blood, and fire, and a cloud of smoke.

(Acts 2:20) 
‘The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.

(Acts 2:21) 
‘And it will be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’

(Acts 2:22) 
“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs, which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—

(Acts 2:23) 
this man, delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.

(Acts 2:24) 
“But God raised him up, releasing him from the pains of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.

(Acts 2:25) 
“For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.

(Acts 2:26) 
‘Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover, my flesh will also dwell in hope.

(Acts 2:27) 
‘For you will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you let your Holy One see corruption.

(Acts 2:28) 
‘You made known to me the ways of life; you will fill me with joy with your presence.’

(Acts 2:29) 
“Brothers, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.

(Acts 2:30) 
“Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,

(Acts 2:31) 
he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

(Acts 2:32) 
“This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.

(Acts 2:33) 
“Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.

(Acts 2:34) 
“For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand,

(Acts 2:35) 
‘until I make your enemies your footstool.’

(Acts 2:36) 
“Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”

(Acts 2:37) 
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what are we to do?”

(Acts 2:38) 
And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 2:39) 
“For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.”

(Acts 2:40) 
And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.”

(Acts 2:41) 
So those who received his word were baptized, and that day about three thousand souls were added.

(Acts 2:42) 
And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

(Acts 2:43) 
And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common.

(Acts 2:44) 
And all who believed were together and had all things in common.

(Acts 2:45) 
And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.

(Acts 2:46) 
And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts,

(Acts 2:47) 
praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

(Acts 3:1) 
Peter and John were going into the temple during the ninth hour of prayer.

(Acts 3:2) 
A certain man, who was lame from birth, was being carried in: they put him every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, so that he might ask for alms from those going into the temple.

(Acts 3:3) 
When he saw Peter and John beginning to enter the temple, he asked that he might receive alms.

(Acts 3:4) 
But Peter, with John, looked intently at him, saying, “Look at us.”

(Acts 3:5) 
And he paid attention to them, hoping that he would receive something from them.

(Acts 3:6) 
But Peter said, “I have neither silver nor gold, but what I have, I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.”

(Acts 3:7) 
And having taken him by the right hand, he raised him up. And immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.

(Acts 3:8) 
And leaping up, he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising God.

(Acts 3:9) 
And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

(Acts 3:10) 
And they recognized him as the one who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

(Acts 3:11) 
And while he was holding Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico, which is called Solomon’s, astonished.

(Acts 3:12) 
But when Peter saw this, he responded to the people: “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made this man walk?

(Acts 3:13) 
The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.

(Acts 3:14) 
But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked that a murderer be granted to you,

(Acts 3:15) 
and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.

(Acts 3:16) 
And on the basis of faith in His name, His name has strengthened this man whom you see and know. And the faith that comes through Him has given the man this complete healing in the presence of you all.

(Acts 3:17) 
And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your leaders.

(Acts 3:18) 
But God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer.

(Acts 3:19) 
Therefore, repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,

(Acts 3:20) 
so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you,

(Acts 3:21) 
whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, which God spoke about by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient times.

(Acts 3:22) 
For Moses said, “The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to Him in everything He tells you.

(Acts 3:23) 
And it will be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from the people.”

(Acts 3:24) 
And all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.

(Acts 3:25) 
You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth will be blessed.’

(Acts 3:26) 
To you first, God, having raised up His Son, sent Him to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”

(Acts 4:1) 
While Peter and John were speaking to the crowd, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees approached them,

(Acts 4:2) 
they were angry that Peter and John were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead,

(Acts 4:3) 
and they seized them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.

(Acts 4:4) 
However, many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of men came to about five thousand.

(Acts 4:5) 
On the next day, the rulers, elders, and scribes gathered in Jerusalem:

(Acts 4:6) 
Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all those who were of the priestly race.

(Acts 4:7) 
And putting Peter and John in the middle, they questioned them: “By what power or by what name did you do this?”

(Acts 4:8) 
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Leaders of the people and elders,

(Acts 4:9) 
if we are being examined today about a good deed done to a weak man, and by what means he was healed,

(Acts 4:10) 
then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead, that this man is standing before you healed.

(Acts 4:11) 
This is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, and has become the cornerstone:

(Acts 4:12) 
And there is salvation in no one else, because there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”

(Acts 4:13) 
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.

(Acts 4:14) 
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.

(Acts 4:15) 
But when they had ordered them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying:

(Acts 4:16) 
“What are we going to do with these men? For a notable sign has been done through them, which is obvious to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.

(Acts 4:17) 
But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them that they speak no more to anyone in this name.”

(Acts 4:18) 
So they called them and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.

(Acts 4:19) 
But Peter and John answered them, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God.

(Acts 4:20) 
For we cannot help but speak about what we have seen and heard.”

(Acts 4:21) 
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, because they could not find any way to punish them, on account of the people, because all were glorifying God for what had been done.

(Acts 4:22) 
For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was over forty years old.

(Acts 4:23) 
When they were released, they went to their own people and reported everything that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.

(Acts 4:24) 
And when they heard it, with one accord they raised their voices to God and said: “Lord, you are the one who made the universe, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.

(Acts 4:25) 
By the Holy Spirit you said through the mouth of our father David, your servant: ‘Why did the nations rage, and the peoples devise empty things?

(Acts 4:26) 
The kings of the earth rose up, and the rulers gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.’

(Acts 4:27) 
For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,

(Acts 4:28) 
to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to happen.

(Acts 4:29) 
And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,

(Acts 4:30) 
while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”

(Acts 4:31) 
And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.

(Acts 4:32) 
Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that anything of what he possessed was his own, but they held everything in common.

(Acts 4:33) 
And with great power the apostles gave testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.

(Acts 4:34) 
For there was not anyone needy among them, because all who owned land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold,

(Acts 4:35) 
and laid it at the apostles’ feet. And distribution was made to each as any had need.

(Acts 4:36) 
Now Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,

(Acts 4:37) 
having a field, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

(Acts 5:1) 
Then Peter rose up and said, “Brothers, listen. God chose me to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, so they could hear and believe.”

(Acts 5:2) 
And God, who knows the mind and heart of every man, also gave the Holy Spirit to them, just as He did to us,

(Acts 5:3) 
making no distinction between us, since He purified their hearts through faith.

(Acts 5:4) 
So, why do you now put God to the test, placing a burden on the necks of these disciples which neither we nor our fathers have been able to carry?

(Acts 5:5) 
But we believe it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, as they are.”

(Acts 5:6) 
And all the assembly of the apostles remained silent. They were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they told of the wonders and signs God had worked through them among the Gentiles.

(Acts 5:7) 
After they were done speaking, James addressed the assembly, saying, “Brothers, listen to me.

(Acts 5:8) 
Simeon has related how God first showed His concern by gathering a people for his own name out of the Gentiles.

(Acts 5:9) 
And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:

(Acts 5:10) 
“After this I will return and rebuild the fallen house of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,

(Acts 5:11) 
so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, including all the Gentiles over whom my name has been proclaimed.”

(Acts 5:12) 
God has shown us this from the beginning of the world.

(Acts 5:13) 
Therefore, it is my judgment that we should not make it difficult for those Gentiles who are turning to God,

(Acts 5:14) 
but we should instead write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from unlawful marriage, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.

(Acts 5:15) 
For from ancient times Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town, as he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”

(Acts 5:16) 
Then the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, decided to send men chosen from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.

(Acts 5:17) 
They sent the following letter by their hand: “The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, who are Gentiles: Greetings.

(Acts 5:18) 
We have heard that some of us went out from us without our authorization. They troubled your souls with what they said and upset you, telling you that you must be circumcised and keep the law. We gave them no such instructions.

(Acts 5:19) 
So we all agreed to choose men to send to you, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

(Acts 5:20) 
men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Acts 5:21) 
We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.

(Acts 5:22) 
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to place no further burden on you than these essential things:

(Acts 5:23) 
that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.”

(Acts 5:24) 
So they left, went down to Antioch, and gathered the whole assembly. Then they delivered the letter.

(Acts 5:25) 
When they read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement it provided.

(Acts 5:26) 
Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.

(Acts 5:27) 
After they spent some time there, they were sent off with peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.

(Acts 5:28) 
But Silas decided to remain there.

(Acts 5:29) 
Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, along with many others.

(Acts 5:30) 
After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the brothers in every town where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.”

(Acts 5:31) 
Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them.

(Acts 5:32) 
But Paul didn’t think it was right to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and hadn’t accompanied them in their work.

(Acts 5:33) 
There was a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed to Cyprus.

(Acts 5:34) 
Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of God.

(Acts 5:35) 
He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

(Acts 6:1) 
Now, in those days, as the number of disciples grew, a complaint arose among the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.

(Acts 6:2) 
The Twelve summoned the whole group of disciples and said: “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.

(Acts 6:3) 
Therefore, brothers, select seven men from among you, of good repute, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint for this task.

(Acts 6:4) 
But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

(Acts 6:5) 
This proposal pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.

(Acts 6:6) 
These they presented to the apostles, and after they prayed, they laid their hands on them.

(Acts 6:7) 
And the word of God continued to spread. The number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.

(Acts 6:8) 
Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people.

(Acts 6:9) 
But some of those who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.

(Acts 6:10) 
And they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.

(Acts 6:11) 
Then they secretly instigated men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”

(Acts 6:12) 
And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council.

(Acts 6:13) 
They set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.

(Acts 6:14) 
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.”

(Acts 6:15) 
And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

(Acts 7:1) 
The high priest then said: “Are these things so?”

(Acts 7:2) 
And Stephen said: "Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he went to live in Charran.

(Acts 7:3) 
And God said to him: 'Leave your land and your family, and come to the land that I will show you.'

(Acts 7:4) 
Then Abraham went out from the land of the Chaldeans, and lived in Charran. And from there, after his father died, God brought him into this land, where you now live.

(Acts 7:5) 
And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of land. But God promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though Abraham had no son then.

(Acts 7:6) 
And God spoke: 'His descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, and they will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.'

(Acts 7:7) 
'But I will judge the nation that they will serve,' God said. 'And after that, they will come out and serve Me in this place.'

(Acts 7:8) 
And God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham fathered Isaac, and Abraham circumcised Isaac on the eighth day. And Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the twelve patriarchs.

(Acts 7:9) 
And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt, but God was with him,

(Acts 7:10) 
and rescued him from all his tribulations. And God gave Joseph favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Pharaoh made Joseph governor over Egypt and over all his household.

(Acts 7:11) 
Now a famine came upon all of Egypt and Canaan, and there was great hardship, and our fathers could not find food.

(Acts 7:12) 
But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there first.

(Acts 7:13) 
And on the second trip, Joseph was recognized by his brothers, and Joseph's family was revealed to Pharaoh.

(Acts 7:14) 
So Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and for his whole family, seventy-five people in all.

(Acts 7:15) 
So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he died there, as did our fathers.

(Acts 7:16) 
And they were brought back to Shechem, and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor, the son of Shechem.

(Acts 7:17) 
But as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

(Acts 7:18) 
until another king arose in Egypt, who did not know Joseph.

(Acts 7:19) 
This king, scheming against our race, mistreated our fathers, and forced them to abandon their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.

(Acts 7:20) 
It was at this time that Moses was born, and he was pleasing to God. And Moses was nourished for three months in his father's house.

(Acts 7:21) 
But when Moses was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and raised him as her own son.

(Acts 7:22) 
And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and in his deeds.

(Acts 7:23) 
Now when Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.

(Acts 7:24) 
And when he saw one of them being wronged, Moses defended him, and avenged the one who was being oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.

(Acts 7:25) 
Moses thought that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.

(Acts 7:26) 
And on the next day Moses appeared to them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! Why do you wrong each other?'

(Acts 7:27) 
But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?'

(Acts 7:28) 
'Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'

(Acts 7:29) 
Then Moses fled at this word, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.

(Acts 7:30) 
And when forty years were completed, an Angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire from a bush.

(Acts 7:31) 
When Moses saw the vision, he marveled at it. And as he approached to examine it, the voice of the Lord came to him,

(Acts 7:32) 
'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' But Moses, trembling, did not dare to consider it.

(Acts 7:33) 
And the Lord said to him: 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.'

(Acts 7:34) 
'I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'

(Acts 7:35) 
This Moses, whom they rejected, saying: 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?' God sent Moses as both a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.

(Acts 7:36) 
Moses led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.

(Acts 7:37) 
This is that Moses who said to the sons of Israel: 'God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brothers, just like me.'

(Acts 7:38) 
This is the Moses who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; Moses received living words to give to us.

(Acts 7:39) 
But our fathers would not obey Moses. They rejected him, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,

(Acts 7:40) 
saying to Aaron: 'Make us gods to go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'

(Acts 7:41) 
And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands.

(Acts 7:42) 
But God turned away from them and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?'

(Acts 7:43) 
'And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Remphan, the images that you made to worship. So I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'

(Acts 7:44) 
Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as He who spoke to Moses directed, so that Moses should make it according to the pattern he had seen.

(Acts 7:45) 
Our fathers, in turn, brought it in with Joshua when they took possession of the land of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before our fathers, until the days of David.

(Acts 7:46) 
David found favor in the sight of God, and he asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

(Acts 7:47) 
But it was Solomon who built a house for God.

(Acts 7:48) 
However, the Most High does not dwell in buildings made by hands, as the prophet says:

(Acts 7:49) 
'Heaven is My throne, and earth is the footstool of My feet. What house will you build for Me?' says the Lord, 'or what is the place of My rest?'

(Acts 7:50) 
'Has not My hand made all these things?'

(Acts 7:51) 
You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.

(Acts 7:52) 
Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become the betrayers and murderers.

(Acts 7:53) 
You received the law as delivered by angels, and you did not keep it.

(Acts 7:54) 
Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.

(Acts 7:55) 
But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into the universe, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

(Acts 7:56) 
And Stephen said: "Behold, I see the sky opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God."

(Acts 7:57) 
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him together,

(Acts 7:58) 
and they cast him out of the city and began to stone him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

(Acts 7:59) 
And they were stoning Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."

(Acts 7:60) 
And he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.

(Acts 8:1) 
Saul approved of the killing of Stephen. A great persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem that very day, and all the Christians were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria—except for the apostles, who stayed in Jerusalem.

(Acts 8:2) 
Some devout men buried Stephen, and they mourned for him.

(Acts 8:3) 
Saul ravaged the Church, entering house after house, dragging off both men and women, and putting them in prison.

(Acts 8:4) 
So those who had been scattered went about preaching the good news of God.

(Acts 8:5) 
Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.

(Acts 8:6) 
The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, because they were united in listening to him and seeing the miracles that he was performing.

(Acts 8:7) 
For unclean spirits, crying out loudly, came out of many who were possessed by them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured.

(Acts 8:8) 
So there was great joy in that city.

(Acts 8:9) 
Now a certain man named Simon had previously practiced magic in the city of Samaria and had amazed the Samaritan people. He claimed to be someone great,

(Acts 8:10) 
and all the people, from the least to the greatest, listened to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called ‘the Great Power.’”

(Acts 8:11) 
They were devoted to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.

(Acts 8:12) 
But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news about the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

(Acts 8:13) 
Even Simon himself believed. And after he was baptized, he stayed close to Philip. When he saw the signs and great miracles that were being performed, he was amazed.

(Acts 8:14) 
Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.

(Acts 8:15) 
When they arrived, they prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 8:16) 
The Spirit had not yet come down on any of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 8:17) 
Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 8:18) 
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,

(Acts 8:19) 
saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 8:20) 
But Peter replied, “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!

(Acts 8:21) 
You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.

(Acts 8:22) 
Repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, your heart’s intent may be forgiven.

(Acts 8:23) 
For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.”

(Acts 8:24) 
Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”

(Acts 8:25) 
So when they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the good news in many villages of the Samaritans.

(Acts 8:26) 
Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This road is desolate.)

(Acts 8:27) 
So he got up and went. There he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of her entire treasury. This man had come to Jerusalem to worship,

(Acts 8:28) 
and he was returning home; he was sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.

(Acts 8:29) 
Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”

(Acts 8:30) 
So Philip ran up to him and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”

(Acts 8:31) 
He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

(Acts 8:32) 
Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.

(Acts 8:33) 
In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who will tell of his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”

(Acts 8:34) 
The eunuch replied to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about? Is it about himself or about someone else?”

(Acts 8:35) 
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this passage, he preached the good news about Jesus to him.

(Acts 8:36) 
And as they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?”

(Acts 8:37) 
And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”

(Acts 8:38) 
Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.

(Acts 8:39) 
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.

(Acts 8:40) 
But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through the region, he proclaimed the good news in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.

(Acts 9:1) 
Meanwhile, Saul was still threatening the Lord’s disciples. He wanted to kill them, so he went to the high priest,

(Acts 9:2) 
and asked for letters to the synagogues in Damascus. He wanted to arrest any men or women who followed the Way of Jesus, so that he could bring them to Jerusalem in chains.

(Acts 9:3) 
As he was traveling and nearing Damascus, suddenly a light shone from the sky all around him.

(Acts 9:4) 
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”

(Acts 9:5) 
Saul asked, “Who are you, Lord?” The voice replied, “I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.

(Acts 9:6) 
Now get up and go into the city, where you will be told what you must do.”

(Acts 9:7) 
The men traveling with him stood speechless. They heard the voice, but they could not see anyone.

(Acts 9:8) 
Saul got up from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.

(Acts 9:9) 
He could not see for three days, and he neither ate nor drank.

(Acts 9:10) 
In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, “Ananias.” Ananias answered, “Here I am, Lord.”

(Acts 9:11) 
The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight. Ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul. He is praying,

(Acts 9:12) 
and he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he can see again.”

(Acts 9:13) 
Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.

(Acts 9:14) 
He has received authority from the chief priests to arrest everyone who calls on your name.”

(Acts 9:15) 
But the Lord said to him, “Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.

(Acts 9:16) 
I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”

(Acts 9:17) 
Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. He placed his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 9:18) 
Immediately something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,

(Acts 9:19) 
and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul stayed with the disciples in Damascus for some days.

(Acts 9:20) 
Immediately he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.

(Acts 9:21) 
All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t this the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”

(Acts 9:22) 
Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.

(Acts 9:23) 
After many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,

(Acts 9:24) 
but Saul learned of their plan. They were watching the city gates day and night in order to kill him.

(Acts 9:25) 
But his followers helped him escape during the night by lowering him in a basket through an opening in the wall.

(Acts 9:26) 
When Saul came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.

(Acts 9:27) 
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.

(Acts 9:28) 
So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.

(Acts 9:29) 
He talked and debated with the Hellenists, but they tried to kill him.

(Acts 9:30) 
When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.

(Acts 9:31) 
Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.

(Acts 9:32) 
As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda.

(Acts 9:33) 
There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.

(Acts 9:34) 
Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up,

(Acts 9:35) 
and all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him. And many turned to the Lord.

(Acts 9:36) 
In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.

(Acts 9:37) 
About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.

(Acts 9:38) 
Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”

(Acts 9:39) 
Peter went with them, and when he arrived, he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.

(Acts 9:40) 
Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.

(Acts 9:41) 
He gave her his hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.

(Acts 9:42) 
This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.

(Acts 9:43) 
Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.

(Acts 10:1) 
There was a certain man in Caesarea, whose name was Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort which is called the Italian,

(Acts 10:2) 
a religious man, and one that feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and always praying to God.

(Acts 10:3) 
This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him: Cornelius.

(Acts 10:4) 
And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord?

(Acts 10:5) 
And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.

(Acts 10:6) 
And now send men to Joppe, and call for one Simon who is surnamed Peter:

(Acts 10:7) 
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.

(Acts 10:8) 
And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius was departed, he called two of his servants, and a soldier that was religious, of them that were with him,

(Acts 10:9) 
To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.

(Acts 10:10) 
And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey, and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.

(Acts 10:11) 
And being hungry, he was desirous to taste something. And whilst they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind:

(Acts 10:12) 
And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners to the earth,

(Acts 10:13) 
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air.

(Acts 10:14) 
And there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter; kill and eat.

(Acts 10:15) 
But Peter said: Far be it from me; for I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean.

(Acts 10:16) 
And the voice came again to him the second time: That which God hath made clean, do not thou call common.

(Acts 10:17) 
And this was done thrice: and incontinently the vessel was taken up into heaven.

(Acts 10:18) 
And as Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's house, stood at the gate.

(Acts 10:19) 
And when they had called, they asked if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

(Acts 10:20) 
And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men seek thee.

(Acts 10:21) 
Arise, therefore, and go down, and do not hesitate to go with them: for I have sent them.

(Acts 10:22) 
Then Peter, going down to the men, said: Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the cause for which you are come?

(Acts 10:23) 
Who said: Cornelius, the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and that hath good testimony from all the nation of the Jews, received an answer from God by a holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.

(Acts 10:24) 
Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following, he arose and went with them: and some of the brethren from Joppe accompanied him.

(Acts 10:25) 
And the next day they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and special friends.

(Acts 10:26) 
And it came to pass that when Peter was come in, Cornelius came to meet him, and fell down and worshipped him.

(Acts 10:27) 
But Peter lifted him up, saying: Arise, I myself also am a man.

(Acts 10:28) 
And as he was talking with him, he went in, and found many that were come together:

(Acts 10:29) 
And he said to them: You know how unlawful it is for a man that is a Jew, to keep company or to come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed to me, not to call any man common or unclean.

(Acts 10:30) 
Therefore I came without any doubt, being sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause have you sent for me?

(Acts 10:31) 
And Cornelius said: Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and I prayed in my house at the ninth hour, and behold a man stood before me in white clothing, and said:

(Acts 10:32) 
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are in remembrance in the sight of God.

(Acts 10:33) 
Send therefore to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.

(Acts 10:34) 
Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore are we all here present in thy sight, to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by God.

(Acts 10:35) 
And Peter opening his mouth, said: In very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons:

(Acts 10:36) 
But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh justice, is acceptable to him.

(Acts 10:37) 
God sent the Son to the children of Israel, to announce peace through Jesus Christ: (he is the Lord of all things).

(Acts 10:38) 
You know what happened, the Word spoken throughout all Judea. It all started in Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed.

(Acts 10:39) 
The mission of Jesus from Nazareth: How God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he passed by doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.

(Acts 10:40) 
And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem: whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.

(Acts 10:41) 
Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,

(Acts 10:42) 
Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose again from the dead:

(Acts 10:43) 
And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.

(Acts 10:44) 
To him all the prophets give testimony, that through his name all receive remission of sins, who believe in him.

(Acts 10:45) 
While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.

(Acts 10:46) 
And they of the circumcision, who believed, were astonished at them that were come with Peter, because that the grace of the Holy Ghost was also poured out upon the Gentiles.

(Acts 10:47) 
For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:

(Acts 10:48) 
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

(Acts 10:49) 
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then they besought him to tarry with them some days.

(Acts 11:1) 
The apostles and the brothers and sisters throughout Judea then heard that the Gentiles had received the word of God.

(Acts 11:2) 
When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision began to argue with him,

(Acts 11:3) 
saying, "Why did you go in to uncircumcised men and eat with them?"

(Acts 11:4) 
Peter then began to explain the matter to them in order.

(Acts 11:5) 
He said, "I was in the city of Joppa, praying; and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain vessel descended, as it were a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came even to me.

(Acts 11:6) 
In this vision I looked and saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild animals, and creeping things, and the birds of the sky.

(Acts 11:7) 
And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'

(Acts 11:8) 
But I said, 'Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'

(Acts 11:9) 
But the voice answered again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed, do not you call common.'

(Acts 11:10) 
Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.

(Acts 11:11) 
And behold, immediately three men stood before the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.

(Acts 11:12) 
And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. And these six brothers went with me also, and we entered into the man's house.

(Acts 11:13) 
And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa and get Simon, who is called Peter,'

(Acts 11:14) 
who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'

(Acts 11:15) 
And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us in the beginning.

(Acts 11:16) 
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'

(Acts 11:17) 
If then God gave the same gift to them as to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?

(Acts 11:18) 
When they heard these things, they held their peace and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life."

(Acts 11:19) 
Now they who were scattered by the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except the Jews only.

(Acts 11:20) 
But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 11:21) 
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

(Acts 11:22) 
Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

(Acts 11:23) 
When he had come and seen the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.

(Acts 11:24) 
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great number of people were added to the Lord.

(Acts 11:25) 
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul.

(Acts 11:26) 
And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great number of people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

(Acts 11:27) 
And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

(Acts 11:28) 
Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there would be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.

(Acts 11:29) 
Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.

(Acts 11:30) 
This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

(Acts 12:1) 
At that same time, Herod the king had some members of the Church arrested.

(Acts 12:2) 
He killed James, the brother of John, with a sword.

(Acts 12:3) 
When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he had Peter arrested as well. This happened during the days of Unleavened Bread.

(Acts 12:4) 
Having arrested him, he put him in prison, entrusting him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him before the people after the Passover.

(Acts 12:5) 
So Peter was kept in prison, but the Church was praying to God for him, constantly.

(Acts 12:6) 
The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards were in front of the door, guarding the prison.

(Acts 12:7) 
Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly!" And the chains fell from his hands.

(Acts 12:8) 
The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and put on your sandals." And he did so. The angel said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."

(Acts 12:9) 
Peter went out and followed him, though he didn't know that what the angel was doing was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.

(Acts 12:10) 
They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them on its own. They went out and walked along one street, and then the angel left him.

(Acts 12:11) 
Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod and from everything the Jewish people were hoping for."

(Acts 12:12) 
When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people were gathered and praying.

(Acts 12:13) 
Peter knocked at the door, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it.

(Acts 12:14) 
Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the door, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the door.

(Acts 12:15) 
They said to her, "You're out of your mind." But she insisted that it was true. They said, "It must be his angel."

(Acts 12:16) 
But Peter kept knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.

(Acts 12:17) 
He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers about this," he said, and then he left and went to another place.

(Acts 12:18) 
In the morning, there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter.

(Acts 12:19) 
After Herod had a thorough search for him and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

(Acts 12:20) 
Herod was furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they came to him in a body. After getting Blastus, the king's personal aide, on their side, they asked for peace, because their country depended on Herod's country for its food supply.

(Acts 12:21) 
On the appointed day, Herod, wearing royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a speech to them.

(Acts 12:22) 
The crowd began to shout, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man."

(Acts 12:23) 
Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, the angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

(Acts 12:24) 
But the Word of the Lord continued to spread and flourish.

(Acts 12:25) 
Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after completing their mission, taking John, also called Mark, with them.

(Acts 13:1) 
Now in the Church that was in Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who was brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

(Acts 13:2) 
As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”

(Acts 13:3) 
Then, after they had fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them away.

(Acts 13:4) 
So they, being sent on a mission by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

(Acts 13:5) 
And when they came to Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John in their ministry.

(Acts 13:6) 
And when they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,

(Acts 13:7) 
who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and was eager to hear the word of God.

(Acts 13:8) 
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is the meaning of his name) was resisting them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

(Acts 13:9) 
But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looking intently at him,

(Acts 13:10) 
said: “O full of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord?

(Acts 13:11) 
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

(Acts 13:12) 
Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

(Acts 13:13) 
Now when Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos, they came to Pamphylia, to Perga. And John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.

(Acts 13:14) 
But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and on the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.

(Acts 13:15) 
After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Men, brothers, if there is any word of exhortation for the people, speak.”

(Acts 13:16) 
Then Paul stood up and, motioning with his hand, said: “Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.

(Acts 13:17) 
The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he led them out of it,

(Acts 13:18) 
and for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.

(Acts 13:19) 
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their land to them by lot,

(Acts 13:20) 
as it were, for about four hundred and fifty years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.

(Acts 13:21) 
And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

(Acts 13:22) 
And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he bore witness and said, ‘I have found in David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’

(Acts 13:23) 
From the offspring of this man, according to the promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,

(Acts 13:24) 
before whose coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

(Acts 13:25) 
And as John was finishing his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not the one. But behold, one comes after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.’

(Acts 13:26) 
“Men, brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation has been sent.

(Acts 13:27) 
For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him, nor understand the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these prophecies by condemning him.

(Acts 13:28) 
And though they found in him no cause for death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.

(Acts 13:29) 
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.

(Acts 13:30) 
But God raised him from the dead on the third day.

(Acts 13:31) 
And for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.

(Acts 13:32) 
And we bring you good news of the promise that was made to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this promise to their children by raising up Jesus,

(Acts 13:33) 
as it is also written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’

(Acts 13:34) 
And that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’

(Acts 13:35) 
Therefore he says also in another place, ‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’

(Acts 13:36) 
For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,

(Acts 13:37) 
but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.

(Acts 13:38) 
Let it be known to you therefore, men, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

(Acts 13:39) 
and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.

(Acts 13:40) 
Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the prophets should come about:

(Acts 13:41) 
“Look, you scoffers, and wonder and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.”

(Acts 13:42) 
As they went out, they begged that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.

(Acts 13:43) 
And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.

(Acts 13:44) 
The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of God.

(Acts 13:45) 
But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.

(Acts 13:46) 
And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.

(Acts 13:47) 
For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’

(Acts 13:48) 
And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.

(Acts 13:49) 
And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.

(Acts 13:50) 
But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.

(Acts 13:51) 
But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.

(Acts 13:52) 
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

(Acts 14:1) 
In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas continued to enter into the synagogue. They preached, and a large multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.

(Acts 14:2) 
But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.

(Acts 14:3) 
Paul and Barnabas remained there a long time, speaking boldly, trusting in the Lord. God’s grace caused them to speak in power and perform miracles.

(Acts 14:4) 
The city was divided. Some sided with the Jews, but others sided with the Apostles.

(Acts 14:5) 
When both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, violently attacked the Apostles, intending to abuse them and stone them...

(Acts 14:6) 
...they fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia and all the surrounding region.

(Acts 14:7) 
They continued to preach there the Gospel.

(Acts 14:8) 
In Lystra, there was a man sitting who was crippled in his feet. He had been lame from birth, and had never walked.

(Acts 14:9) 
He listened to Paul speaking. Paul looked at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,

(Acts 14:10) 
said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" And he leaped up and began to walk.

(Acts 14:11) 
When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, saying, “The gods have come down to us, in the likeness of men!”

(Acts 14:12) 
They called Barnabas “Jupiter,” and Paul “Mercury,” because Paul was the chief speaker.

(Acts 14:13) 
The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, and with the crowds, wanted to offer sacrifice.

(Acts 14:14) 
But when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, shouting:

(Acts 14:15) 
“Men, why are you doing this? We are also mortals, like you. We are preaching so that you turn from these empty things and come to the living God, who created the universe and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.

(Acts 14:16) 
In generations past, he allowed all the Gentiles to follow their own ways.

(Acts 14:17) 
Yet he did not leave himself without a witness. He did good, giving you rain from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and joy.

(Acts 14:18) 
Even saying these things, it was barely enough to restrain the crowds from sacrificing to them.

(Acts 14:19) 
Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and they persuaded the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

(Acts 14:20) 
But when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went back into the city. The next day, he went with Barnabas to Derbe.

(Acts 14:21) 
After preaching the Gospel to that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

(Acts 14:22) 
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith, because we must endure many tribulations to enter into the Kingdom of God.

(Acts 14:23) 
Then they appointed presbyters for them in each church, with prayer and fasting, and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

(Acts 14:24) 
Then, after passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

(Acts 14:25) 
After they spoke the word of the Lord in Perga, they went down to Attalia,

(Acts 14:26) 
and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.

(Acts 14:27) 
When they arrived, and gathered the Church, they reported all the things God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

(Acts 14:28) 
They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.

(Acts 15:1) 
Certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brothers: “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”

(Acts 15:2) 
When there was no small dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas against them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to the apostles and priests in Jerusalem, about this question.

(Acts 15:3) 
They therefore, having been led forward by the Church, were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria, narrating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they were making great joy to all the brothers.

(Acts 15:4) 
When they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the Church and the apostles and priests, announcing how great a thing God had done with them.

(Acts 15:5) 
Certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees, who had believed, rose up, saying: “It is necessary to circumcise them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”

(Acts 15:6) 
The apostles and the elders assembled to consider the word about this.

(Acts 15:7) 
When there was much debate, Peter rose up and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that from the ancient days God chose among us, that the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel by my mouth, and believe.”

(Acts 15:8) 
And God, who knows the hearts, bore witness, giving to them the Holy Spirit, just as to us:

(Acts 15:9) 
And He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

(Acts 15:10) 
Now therefore why are you tempting God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we could bear?

(Acts 15:11) 
But through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe that we shall be saved, in the same way as they also [shall be saved].

(Acts 15:12) 
Then all the multitude fell silent: and they listened to Barnabas and Paul, relating how great signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them.

(Acts 15:13) 
And after they were silent, James answered, saying: “Men, brothers, hear me.

(Acts 15:14) 
Simon has recounted how God first visited, taking from the Gentiles a holy people for His name.

(Acts 15:15) 
And with this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:

(Acts 15:16) 
“After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David that has fallen: and I will rebuild its ruins, and I will raise it up:

(Acts 15:17) 
so that the rest of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My name is called, says the Lord, who does these things.”

(Acts 15:18) 
Known from the beginning is His work with God.

(Acts 15:19) 
Wherefore I judge that those who are converted to God from the Gentiles should not be disturbed,

(Acts 15:20) 
but that they should write to them that they abstain from the contaminations of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

(Acts 15:21) 
For Moses, from the generations of old, has in every city those who preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every Sabbath.

(Acts 15:22) 
Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole Church, to choose men from among themselves, and to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, Judas, who was called Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.

(Acts 15:23) 
Writing by their hands: “The apostles and the elder brothers to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers from the Gentiles, greeting.”

(Acts 15:24) 
“Because we have heard that certain ones, who went out from among us, have disturbed you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we did not give any command:

(Acts 15:25) 
it has pleased us, gathered together in one place, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

(Acts 15:26) 
men who have delivered their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Acts 15:27) 
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who also will tell you the same things.”

(Acts 15:28) 
“For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to impose upon you no further burden than these necessary things:

(Acts 15:29) 
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication: from which keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Farewell.”

(Acts 15:30) 
So they, having been dismissed, went to Antioch: and gathering the multitude together, they delivered the letter.

(Acts 15:31) 
When they had read it, they rejoiced over the consolation.

(Acts 15:32) 
Judas and Silas, they also being prophets, with many words exhorted the brothers, and they strengthened them.

(Acts 15:33) 
And after they had spent some time there, they were dismissed with peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.

(Acts 15:34) 
But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.

(Acts 15:35) 
But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and evangelizing with many others the word of the Lord.

(Acts 15:36) 
After some days, Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us return and visit the brothers through all the cities in which we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”

(Acts 15:37) 
And Barnabas wanted to take with them also John, who was called Mark.

(Acts 15:38) 
But Paul was asking him not to take this one with them, who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.

(Acts 15:39) 
There was a disagreement, so that they departed from each other, and Barnabas, taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus:

(Acts 15:40) 
But Paul, having chosen Silas, set out, having been delivered to the grace of God by the brothers.

(Acts 15:41) 
And he was going through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the Apostles and elders.

(Acts 16:1) 
Paul next traveled to Derbe and Lystra. There was a disciple named Timothy there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, and his father was a Gentile.

(Acts 16:2) 
The brothers at Lystra and Iconium gave a good report of him.

(Acts 16:3) 
Paul wanted Timothy to go with him. He had Timothy circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Gentile.

(Acts 16:4) 
As they traveled from town to town, they passed along the decisions that had been made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, and the new churches obeyed these commands.

(Acts 16:5) 
So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

(Acts 16:6) 
Then they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian regions, being prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.

(Acts 16:7) 
When they came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

(Acts 16:8) 
So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.

(Acts 16:9) 
During the night, Paul had a vision. A man of Macedonia was standing and begging him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”

(Acts 16:10) 
As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we immediately tried to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

(Acts 16:11) 
Setting sail from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.

(Acts 16:12) 
From there we went to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days.

(Acts 16:13) 
On the Sabbath, we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we thought there would be a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there.

(Acts 16:14) 
A woman named Lydia, a seller of purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, was listening. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what Paul said.

(Acts 16:15) 
After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she compelled us.

(Acts 16:16) 
One day as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling.

(Acts 16:17) 
Following Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.”

(Acts 16:18) 
And she kept doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And it came out that very hour.

(Acts 16:19) 
But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the marketplace before the authorities.

(Acts 16:20) 
And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are disturbing our city. They are Jews,

(Acts 16:21) 
and are proclaiming customs that are not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”

(Acts 16:22) 
The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.

(Acts 16:23) 
And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.

(Acts 16:24) 
Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.

(Acts 16:25) 
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.

(Acts 16:26) 
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bonds were unfastened.

(Acts 16:27) 
When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

(Acts 16:28) 
But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”

(Acts 16:29) 
And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas.

(Acts 16:30) 
Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”

(Acts 16:31) 
And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”

(Acts 16:32) 
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

(Acts 16:33) 
And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds; and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.

(Acts 16:34) 
Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.

(Acts 16:35) 
But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police to say, “Release those men.”

(Acts 16:36) 
And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore, come out now and go in peace.”

(Acts 16:37) 
But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly without a trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and now they are secretly sending us away? No, let them come themselves and

(Acts 16:38) 
take us out.”

(Acts 16:39) 
The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.

(Acts 16:40) 
So they came and apologized to them. And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city.

(Acts 16:41) 
So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.

(Acts 17:1) 
After Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived in Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.

(Acts 17:2) 
Paul then went into the synagogue, as was his custom. For three Sabbaths, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

(Acts 17:3) 
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer, and to rise again from the dead. And he said, "This Jesus whom I announce to you is the Christ."

(Acts 17:4) 
Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of Gentile converts and many prominent women.

(Acts 17:5) 
But the Jews were jealous, and they gathered wicked men from the marketplace, and stirred up the city. They attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.

(Acts 17:6) 
Not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here too,

(Acts 17:7) 
and Jason has received them. They are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."

(Acts 17:8) 
They stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.

(Acts 17:9) 
After taking security from Jason and the others, they let them go.

(Acts 17:10) 
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.

(Acts 17:11) 
These Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, because they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

(Acts 17:12) 
Many of them therefore believed, as did quite a few of the distinguished Greek women and many men.

(Acts 17:13) 
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Beroea also, they came there too, stirring up and disturbing the crowds.

(Acts 17:14) 
Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.

(Acts 17:15) 
Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens. After receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.

(Acts 17:16) 
Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.

(Acts 17:17) 
So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.

(Acts 17:18) 
Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities," because he was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection.

(Acts 17:19) 
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?

(Acts 17:20) 
For you bring some strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."

(Acts 17:21) 
Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.

(Acts 17:22) 
So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.

(Acts 17:23) 
For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.

(Acts 17:24) 
The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of the universe and the earth, does not live in temples made by hands,

(Acts 17:25) 
nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.

(Acts 17:26) 
And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,

(Acts 17:27) 
that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,

(Acts 17:28) 
for "'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are indeed his offspring.'

(Acts 17:29) 
Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.

(Acts 17:30) 
The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,

(Acts 17:31) 
because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."

(Acts 17:32) 
Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, "We will hear you again about this."

(Acts 17:33) 
So Paul went out from their midst.

(Acts 17:34) 
But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.

(Acts 18:1) 
After these things, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

(Acts 18:2) 
And when he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome), he went to them.

(Acts 18:3) 
And because he practiced the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for they were tentmakers.

(Acts 18:4) 
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, explaining the name of Jesus, and persuading Jews and Greeks.

(Acts 18:5) 
But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

(Acts 18:6) 
But when they opposed and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them: “Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”

(Acts 18:7) 
And he departed from there and went to the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.

(Acts 18:8) 
And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.

(Acts 18:9) 
And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision: “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent;

(Acts 18:10) 
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”

(Acts 18:11) 
And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

(Acts 18:12) 
But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,

(Acts 18:13) 
saying: “This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”

(Acts 18:14) 
And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If there were any act of wrongdoing or a wicked crime, O Jews, I would have reason to hear you.

(Acts 18:15) 
But if there are questions of words and names and your law, you yourselves look to it. I will not be a judge of these things.”

(Acts 18:16) 
And he drove them from the judgment seat.

(Acts 18:17) 
Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.

(Acts 18:18) 
Then Paul, after staying many more days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having cut his hair in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.

(Acts 18:19) 
And he came to Ephesus, and he left them there. But he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

(Acts 18:20) 
When they asked him to stay longer, he did not consent,

(Acts 18:21) 
but took leave of them, saying: “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem. But I will return again to you, God willing.” And he set out from Ephesus.

(Acts 18:22) 
And when he had come down to Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then he went down to Antioch.

(Acts 18:23) 
And having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

(Acts 18:24) 
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, mighty in the Scriptures.

(Acts 18:25) 
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.

(Acts 18:26) 
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

(Acts 18:27) 
And when he wanted to pass over to Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed,

(Acts 18:28) 
for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

(Acts 19:1) 
After Apollos had moved on to Corinth, Paul traveled through the upper regions and came to Ephesus. There, he found some disciples,

(Acts 19:2) 
and he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “We haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”

(Acts 19:3) 
He asked them, “Then how were you baptized?” They answered, “With John's baptism.”

(Acts 19:4) 
Paul then said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.”

(Acts 19:5) 
After hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

(Acts 19:6) 
And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.

(Acts 19:7) 
There were about twelve men in all.

(Acts 19:8) 
He entered the synagogue, and for three months he spoke boldly, debating and persuading people about the kingdom of God.

(Acts 19:9) 
But when some of them hardened themselves and refused to believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them, and separated the disciples, arguing daily in the school of Tyrannus.

(Acts 19:10) 
This continued for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

(Acts 19:11) 
And God worked extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,

(Acts 19:12) 
so that when they placed handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body on the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.

(Acts 19:13) 
Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”

(Acts 19:14) 
There were seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva who were doing this.

(Acts 19:15) 
But the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?”

(Acts 19:16) 
And the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them all, and they ran out of the house naked and wounded.

(Acts 19:17) 
This became known to everyone in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

(Acts 19:18) 
Many of those who had believed came, confessing and divulging their practices.

(Acts 19:19) 
And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in front of everyone. When they calculated the value of the books, they found that it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.

(Acts 19:20) 
So the word of the Lord continued to grow and prevail.

(Acts 19:21) 
Now after these events, Paul decided in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”

(Acts 19:22) 
So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia for a while.

(Acts 19:23) 
About that time, there arose a considerable disturbance concerning the Way.

(Acts 19:24) 
For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the artisans.

(Acts 19:25) 
He gathered them together with the workmen of similar trades and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this business.

(Acts 19:26) 
You also see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost the whole of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.

(Acts 19:27) 
And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will be dethroned from her magnificence.”

(Acts 19:28) 
When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

(Acts 19:29) 
The city was filled with confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's Macedonian travel companions.

(Acts 19:30) 
But when Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.

(Acts 19:31) 
Some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, also sent a message to him urging him not to venture into the theater.

(Acts 19:32) 
Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.

(Acts 19:33) 
Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.

(Acts 19:34) 
But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

(Acts 19:35) 
And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven?

(Acts 19:36) 
Since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.

(Acts 19:37) 
For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.

(Acts 19:38) 
If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.

(Acts 19:39) 
But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.

(Acts 19:40) 
For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause for which we can give an account of this commotion.”

(Acts 19:41) 
And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

(Acts 20:1) 
After the riot had ended, Paul called together his disciples, and encouraged them. Then he departed, heading towards Macedonia.

(Acts 20:2) 
Having traveled throughout those areas, he encouraged them with many words. Then he came to Greece.

(Acts 20:3) 
He spent three months there. When the Jews plotted against him, intending to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.

(Acts 20:4) 
Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy accompanied him. Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia were also with him.

(Acts 20:5) 
These men went ahead and waited for us in Troas.

(Acts 20:6) 
After the Feast of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi. Five days later, we met them in Troas.

(Acts 20:7) 
On the first day of the week, when the disciples gathered to break bread, Paul spoke with them, since he was going to leave the next day. He kept speaking until midnight.

(Acts 20:8) 
There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.

(Acts 20:9) 
A young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window. He was overcome by deep sleep while Paul was speaking at length, and falling from the third story, he was taken up dead.

(Acts 20:10) 
Paul went down and threw himself on him. Embracing him, he said, “Do not be alarmed, for his soul is in him.”

(Acts 20:11) 
Then he went upstairs, broke bread, and ate. He talked for a long time until dawn. Then he departed.

(Acts 20:12) 
They took the young man back alive, and they were greatly comforted.

(Acts 20:13) 
Meanwhile, we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard, as he had planned. He himself would travel by land.

(Acts 20:14) 
When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene.

(Acts 20:15) 
We sailed from there and the next day arrived opposite Chios. The following day we put in at Samos, and the next day we arrived at Miletus.

(Acts 20:16) 
Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not have to spend time in Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, for the day of Pentecost.

(Acts 20:17) 
From Miletus, he sent for the elders of the church in Ephesus.

(Acts 20:18) 
When they came to him, he said, “You know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day I came to Asia,

(Acts 20:19) 
“serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and trials, which befell me through the plots of the Jews.

(Acts 20:20) 
“How I did not shrink from declaring anything that was helpful for you, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,

(Acts 20:21) 
“testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.

(Acts 20:22) 
“And now, bound by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,

(Acts 20:23) 
“except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.

(Acts 20:24) 
“But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.

(Acts 20:25) 
“And now, I know that you will no longer see my face, all of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom.

(Acts 20:26) 
“Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you.

(Acts 20:27) 
“For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.

(Acts 20:28) 
“Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.

(Acts 20:29) 
“I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.

(Acts 20:30) 
“And from among your own selves, men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.

(Acts 20:31) 
“Therefore, be watchful, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears.

(Acts 20:32) 
“And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, who is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

(Acts 20:33) 
“I coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.

(Acts 20:34) 
“You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.

(Acts 20:35) 
“In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”

(Acts 20:36) 
When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.

(Acts 20:37) 
And they all wept a great deal, and falling on Paul’s neck, they kissed him,

(Acts 20:38) 
being especially grieved by the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.

(Acts 21:1) 
After we escaped, we set sail. We sailed straight to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

(Acts 21:2) 
We found a ship sailing to Phoenicia, and we boarded and set sail.

(Acts 21:3) 
We sighted Cyprus, leaving it to the left, and sailed to Syria. We landed at Tyre because the ship was going to unload its cargo there.

(Acts 21:4) 
Finding the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Holy Spirit, they warned Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:5) 
When our time there was up, we set out and continued on our way. They all, with their wives and children, escorted us out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.

(Acts 21:6) 
After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.

(Acts 21:7) 
We continued our voyage and sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.

(Acts 21:8) 
The next day we set out and came to Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.

(Acts 21:9) 
He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.

(Acts 21:10) 
As we were staying there for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

(Acts 21:11) 
He came to us and took Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands, he said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit: ‘The man whose belt this is, the Jews will bind in Jerusalem and deliver into the hands of the Gentiles.’”

(Acts 21:12) 
When we heard this, we and the others there begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:13) 
Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

(Acts 21:14) 
When he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, “The will of the Lord be done.”

(Acts 21:15) 
After these days, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.

(Acts 21:16) 
Some of the disciples from Caesarea came with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, where we were to stay.

(Acts 21:17) 
When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.

(Acts 21:18) 
The next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.

(Acts 21:19) 
After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.

(Acts 21:20) 
When they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law.

(Acts 21:21) 
And they have been told about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to the customs.

(Acts 21:22) 
What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.

(Acts 21:23) 
Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.

(Acts 21:24) 
Take these men and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.

(Acts 21:25) 
But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our decision that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.”

(Acts 21:26) 
Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, announcing the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.

(Acts 21:27) 
When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,

(Acts 21:28) 
crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”

(Acts 21:29) 
For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.

(Acts 21:30) 
The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.

(Acts 21:31) 
As they were seeking to kill him, the report came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.

(Acts 21:32) 
He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

(Acts 21:33) 
Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.

(Acts 21:34) 
Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.

(Acts 21:35) 
When he came to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,

(Acts 21:36) 
for the mob of the people followed, crying out, “Away with him!”

(Acts 21:37) 
As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?”

(Acts 21:38) 
And he replied, “Do you know Greek?

(Acts 21:39) 
Are you not the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up a revolt and led out into the desert the four thousand men of the Assassins?”

(Acts 21:40) 
Paul said, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.”

(Acts 22:1) 
Men, brothers, and fathers, hear now my defense!

(Acts 22:2) 
They were even more ready to listen when they heard Paul speaking Hebrew.

(Acts 22:3) 
Then Paul said: “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I studied at the feet of Gamaliel, and I was taught in accordance with the law of our fathers. I was full of zeal for God, as all of you are today.

(Acts 22:4) 
I persecuted the followers of this new way, even to the point of death. I imprisoned men and women.

(Acts 22:5) 
The high priest and the entire council can testify to this. After receiving letters to the brothers, I was on my way to Damascus to bring back the prisoners who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.

(Acts 22:6) 
As I was on my way and approaching Damascus, around noon a bright light suddenly flashed around me from the universe:

(Acts 22:7) 
I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’

(Acts 22:8) 
I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’

(Acts 22:9) 
Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.

(Acts 22:10) 
I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord replied, ‘Go to Damascus, and there you will be told all that you are appointed to do.’

(Acts 22:11) 
Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and I went to Damascus.

(Acts 22:12) 
A man named Ananias, a devout observer of the Law, who was well respected by all the Jews living there,

(Acts 22:13) 
came and stood by me, and said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight.’ And at that very moment I looked up at him.

(Acts 22:14) 
He said, ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to know His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of His voice.

(Acts 22:15) 
For you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.

(Acts 22:16) 
And now, why delay? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.’

(Acts 22:17) 
It happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance.

(Acts 22:18) 
I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’

(Acts 22:19) 
I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You in every synagogue.

(Acts 22:20) 
And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I was there, agreeing with his execution, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’

(Acts 22:21) 
Then He said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the nations.’

(Acts 22:22) 
They listened to him until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, ‘Get rid of this man from the earth, for he is not worthy to live!’

(Acts 22:23) 
As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,

(Acts 22:24) 
the tribune ordered Paul to be brought into the fortress and commanded that he be examined by scourging, to learn the reason why they were shouting against him.

(Acts 22:25) 
When they stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion standing by, ‘Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen?’

(Acts 22:26) 
When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and told him, saying, ‘What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.’

(Acts 22:27) 
The tribune approached Paul and asked, ‘Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?’ And Paul replied, ‘I am.’

(Acts 22:28) 
The tribune answered, ‘I paid a large sum for this citizenship.’ Paul said, ‘But I was born a citizen.’

(Acts 22:29) 
Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew. The tribune was also afraid because he had bound Paul, since he knew that he was a Roman citizen.

(Acts 22:30) 
Wishing to know the real reason why the Jews were accusing him, the next day the tribune released Paul and ordered the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and placed him before them.

(Acts 23:1) 
Then Paul, looking at the council, said: "Brothers, I have lived before God with a clear conscience, even to this day."

(Acts 23:2) 
But the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by to strike him on the mouth.

(Acts 23:3) 
Then Paul said to him: "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit there judging me according to the law, and then order me to be struck in violation of the law?"

(Acts 23:4) 
Those who stood by said: "Do you revile God's high priest?"

(Acts 23:5) 
And Paul said: "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.’"

(Acts 23:6) 
But Paul, knowing that one part of them were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I am being judged for the hope and the resurrection of the dead."

(Acts 23:7) 
And when he had said this, there arose a division between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.

(Acts 23:8) 
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.

(Acts 23:9) 
Then a great cry arose, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party rose up, contending and saying: "We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"

(Acts 23:10) 
And when a great dissension arose, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him from among them and bring him into the fortress.

(Acts 23:11) 
And the following night, the Lord stood by him and said: "Be of good cheer; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome."

(Acts 23:12) 
And when day came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

(Acts 23:13) 
There were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy.

(Acts 23:14) 
They went to the chief priests and the elders and said: "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."

(Acts 23:15) 
So now you, with the council, give notice to the tribune so that he may bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to examine his case more fully. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near."

(Acts 23:16) 
But when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the fortress and told Paul.

(Acts 23:17) 
Then Paul called one of the centurions and said: "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."

(Acts 23:18) 
The centurion took him, and brought him to the tribune, and said: "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you."

(Acts 23:19) 
The tribune took the young man by the hand and, taking him aside, asked him privately: "What is it that you have to tell me?"

(Acts 23:20) 
And he said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more fully about him.

(Acts 23:21) 
So do not listen to them, for more than forty men from among them are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And they are now ready, waiting for your promise."

(Acts 23:22) 
Then the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of these things." 

(Acts 23:23) 
He then called two centurions and said: "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night."

(Acts 23:24) 
Also, provide mounts so that they may set Paul on them and bring him safely to Felix the governor."

(Acts 23:25) 
And he wrote a letter, which read as follows:

(Acts 23:26) 
"Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.

(Acts 23:27) 
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. When I learned that he was a Roman citizen, I came upon them with the soldiers.

(Acts 23:28) 
Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.

(Acts 23:29) 
I found him to be accused over questions about their law, but as having no charge worthy of death or imprisonment.

(Acts 23:30) 
And when it was revealed to me that the Jews were planning an ambush for the man, I sent him to you without delay, and I also commanded his accusers to state their case before you. Farewell."

(Acts 23:31) 
So the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

(Acts 23:32) 
On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and they returned to the fortress.

(Acts 23:33) 
When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.

(Acts 23:34) 
And when he had read it, he asked him what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,

(Acts 23:35) 
"I will hear your case," he said, "when your accusers arrive." And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.

(Acts 24:1) 
Five days later, Ananias the high priest went to Caesarea, along with some of the elders, and with the orator Tertullus. They made accusations against Paul to the governor.

(Acts 24:2) 
After Paul was summoned, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: "Since we are experiencing much peace through your wise governance, and many reforms are being made for our people by your foresight,"

(Acts 24:3) 
“we always and in all places acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.

(Acts 24:4) 
But, so as not to detain you, I ask that you hear us briefly, with your usual kindness.

(Acts 24:5) 
“For we have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

(Acts 24:6) 
“He even tried to profane the Temple. We arrested him.

(Acts 24:7) 
“But Lysias the tribune came and rescued him from our hands by using great force.

(Acts 24:8) 
“He ordered his accusers to come to you. From him, you can learn about all these things.

(Acts 24:9) 
“The Jews also joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were so.”

(Acts 24:10) 
Then Paul, by a nod from the governor, began his defense: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I confidently make my defense.

(Acts 24:11) 
“For you can ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

(Acts 24:12) 
“And they did not find me disputing with anyone in the Temple, or causing a riot among the people, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.

(Acts 24:13) 
“And they cannot prove the things they now accuse me of.

(Acts 24:14) 
“But I confess this to you: that I worship the God of my ancestors in the way they call a heresy, believing everything laid down in the Law and the Prophets.

(Acts 24:15) 
“I have hope in God, which they themselves also await, that there will be a resurrection of the just and the unjust.

(Acts 24:16) 
“And so, I always strive to keep my conscience clear before God and men.

(Acts 24:17) 
“Now, after many years, I came to bring alms and offerings for my nation.

(Acts 24:18) 
“While I was in these activities, some Jews from Asia found me in the Temple. I was purified and not with a crowd or in an uproar.

(Acts 24:19) 
“They should have been here before you to make accusations, if they had any against me.

(Acts 24:20) 
“Or let these men here themselves state what wrong they found when I stood before the council,

(Acts 24:21) 
“unless it was for this one statement I cried out while standing among them: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged before you today.'

(Acts 24:22) 
Felix, having heard these things, postponed the hearing, saying: “When I have examined the case more carefully, I will decide it.

(Acts 24:23) 
He ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody, but to allow him some freedom and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to or visiting him.

(Acts 24:24) 
After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

(Acts 24:25) 
And as Paul discussed righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said: "Go away for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will send for you."

(Acts 24:26) 
At the same time, he hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, so he often sent for him and talked with him.

(Acts 24:27) 
When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.

(Acts 25:1) 
After Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea after three days.

(Acts 25:2) 
The high priests and the Jewish leaders went to him and informed Festus about Paul, begging him,

(Acts 25:3) 
asking a favor against him, that he send him to Jerusalem. They were plotting to kill him along the way.

(Acts 25:4) 
Festus replied that Paul was being kept under guard in Caesarea and that he himself would be returning quickly.

(Acts 25:5) 
“Therefore,” he said, “let the men among you who are powerful go down with me and accuse him if there is anything wrong with the man.”

(Acts 25:6) 
After spending eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought in.

(Acts 25:7) 
When he appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges which they couldn't prove,

(Acts 25:8) 
while Paul defended himself, saying that he had committed no offense against the Jewish Law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar.

(Acts 25:9) 
Festus, wishing to do a favor for the Jews, answered Paul: “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me in these matters?”

(Acts 25:10) 
Paul said: “I am standing at Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you yourself well know.”

(Acts 25:11) 
“If I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die. But if there is nothing in what these men accuse me of, no one can give me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”

(Acts 25:12) 
Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”

(Acts 25:13) 
After some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea and greeted Festus.

(Acts 25:14) 
After they had spent many days there, Festus explained Paul’s case to the king, saying: “There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix,

(Acts 25:15) 
about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the high priests and the elders of the Jews asked for a judgment, demanding condemnation.

(Acts 25:16) 
I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused has his accusers present, and he is allowed to defend himself against the charges.

(Acts 25:17) 
So when they came here, without delay, I sat on the tribunal the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.

(Acts 25:18) 
When the accusers stood around, they brought no charge of any wrongdoing that I suspected of him.

(Acts 25:19) 
But they had some questions about their own superstition against him, and about a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul said was alive.

(Acts 25:20) 
Because I was uncertain about this question, I asked if he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these matters.

(Acts 25:21) 
But when Paul appealed to be kept for the judgment of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”

(Acts 25:22) 
Then Agrippa said to Festus: “I would also like to hear the man.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”

(Acts 25:23) 
The next day, when Agrippa and Bernice arrived with great pomp, and entered the audience hall with the tribunes and the leading men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.

(Acts 25:24) 
Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all of you here with us, you see this man, about whom the whole multitude of Jews has petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he shouldn’t live any longer.

(Acts 25:25) 
But to me it seemed that he had done nothing deserving of death. But because he appealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him.”

(Acts 25:26) 
“I don’t have anything certain to write to the Lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation, I may have something to write.

(Acts 25:27) 
“For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to show the charges against him.”

(Acts 26:1) 
Paul, writing with his own hand, said: “King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed that I have to defend myself today before you concerning all of the things of which you accuse me,

(Acts 26:2) 
especially because you are well acquainted with all the customs and the controversies among the Jews. I therefore beg you to listen to me patiently.

(Acts 26:3) 
For my life from my youth, which was from the beginning among my nation and in Jerusalem, is well known to all the Jews,

(Acts 26:4) 
who know me from the beginning, if they wish to bear witness, because I lived according to the strictest sect of our religion, as a Pharisee.

(Acts 26:5) 
And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise which was made by God to our fathers,

(Acts 26:6) 
the hope of which the twelve tribes, continuously serving, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.

(Acts 26:7) 
Why do you consider it unbelievable that God raises the dead?

(Acts 26:8) 
I truly thought that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth:

(Acts 26:9) 
and I did this in Jerusalem. I imprisoned many of the saints, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were being put to death, I cast my vote against them.

(Acts 26:10) 
And punishing them often in every synagogue, I forced them to blaspheme. And I was extremely enraged at them, even persecuting them to distant cities.

(Acts 26:11) 
In which I was traveling to Damascus, with the authority and permission of the chief priests,

(Acts 26:12) 
at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who were with me.

(Acts 26:13) 
But when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.”

(Acts 26:14) 
And I said, “Who are you, Lord?” And the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

(Acts 26:15) 
But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, that I may appoint you as a minister and a witness of those things which you have seen and of those things in which I will appear to you,

(Acts 26:16) 
delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,

(Acts 26:17) 
to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.”

(Acts 26:18) 
Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,

(Acts 26:19) 
but proclaimed to those of Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing works worthy of repentance.

(Acts 26:20) 
For this reason the Jews, when I was in the temple, tried to kill me.

(Acts 26:21) 
Having therefore obtained help from God, I stand to this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing except those things which the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:

(Acts 26:22) 
that Christ should suffer, that He should be the first to rise from the dead, and that He would proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.”

(Acts 26:23) 
As he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Much learning is driving you to madness.”

(Acts 26:24) 
But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the words of truth and soberness.

(Acts 26:25) 
For the king knows about these things, to whom I also speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.

(Acts 26:26) 
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”

(Acts 26:27) 
Then Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time you persuade me to become a Christian.”

(Acts 26:28) 
And Paul said, “I would to God that not only you, but also all those who hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”

(Acts 26:29) 
When he had said these things, the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with them rose up;

(Acts 26:30) 
and when they had withdrawn, they talked with one another, saying, “This man is doing nothing worthy of death or chains.”

(Acts 26:31) 
Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”

(Acts 27:1) 
When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who was from the Augustan cohort.

(Acts 27:2) 
We boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to ports along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus of Thessalonica, a Macedonian, was with us.

(Acts 27:3) 
The next day, we put in at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive their care.

(Acts 27:4) 
We set sail from there and sailed along the coast of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.

(Acts 27:5) 
We sailed through the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, and arrived at Myra in Lycia.

(Acts 27:6) 
There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.

(Acts 27:7) 
After sailing slowly for many days, we arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind was against us, we sailed along the coast of Crete, near Salmone.

(Acts 27:8) 
We struggled to sail along it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.

(Acts 27:9) 
Since much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was already over, Paul warned them,

(Acts 27:10) 
“Men, I see that this voyage will be disastrous and cause great damage, not only to the ship and the cargo, but also to our lives.”

(Acts 27:11) 
But the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the ship’s captain than by what Paul said.

(Acts 27:12) 
Because the harbor wasn’t suitable for wintering, most of them decided to sail on from there, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor in Crete facing southwest and northwest, to winter there.

(Acts 27:13) 
When a gentle south wind began to blow, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete.

(Acts 27:14) 
But soon a hurricane-force wind, called the northeaster, struck the ship.

(Acts 27:15) 
The ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave way to it and were driven along.

(Acts 27:16) 
Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to get the ship’s boat under control. After hoisting it aboard, they used ropes to rig the ship, and fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sails and let the ship be driven along.

(Acts 27:17) 
The next day, as we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to jettison cargo. On the third day, they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands.

(Acts 27:18) 
When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and the storm continued raging, all hope of our being saved was at last gone.

(Acts 27:19) 
Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have taken my advice not to set sail from Crete and have avoided this damage and loss.

(Acts 27:20) 
“But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be lost.

(Acts 27:21) 
“For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me

(Acts 27:22) 
and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar. And God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’

(Acts 27:23) 
So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.

(Acts 27:24) 
“We must run aground on some island.”

(Acts 27:25) 
About midnight the sailors sensed that they were approaching land. They took soundings and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms. Fearing that we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.

(Acts 27:26) 
In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to let go anchors from the bow.

(Acts 27:27) 
Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.”

(Acts 27:28) 
Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.

(Acts 27:29) 
When daylight began to appear, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “For the past fourteen days you have been in constant suspense, without food, eating nothing.

(Acts 27:30) 
“Therefore I urge you to take some food. You need it for your survival, for not a hair of your head will be lost.”

(Acts 27:31) 
After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.

(Acts 27:32) 
They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.

(Acts 27:33) 
Altogether there were 276 of us on board.

(Acts 27:34) 
When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.

(Acts 27:35) 
When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they planned to run the ship ashore if they could.

(Acts 27:36) 
Cutting loose the anchors, they put out to sea, and at the same time loosened the ropes that held the rudders. They hoisted the foresail to the wind and sailed toward the beach.

(Acts 27:37) 
But striking a reef, the ship ran aground, and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken to pieces by the surf.

(Acts 27:38) 
The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.

(Acts 27:39) 
But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,

(Acts 27:40) 
and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.

(Acts 28:1) 
After we survived the shipwreck, we learned that the island was called Melita.

(Acts 28:2) 
The local people treated us with uncommon kindness.

(Acts 28:3) 
They lit a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain and the cold.

(Acts 28:4) 
Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire. A viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.

(Acts 28:5) 
When the local people saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer! Though he escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”

(Acts 28:6) 
Paul, however, shook the snake into the fire and suffered no harm.

(Acts 28:7) 
They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and saw that nothing happened to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

(Acts 28:8) 
Near that place were the lands of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and showed us generous hospitality for three days.

(Acts 28:9) 
It happened that Publius' father was sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after praying and laying his hands on him, he healed him.

(Acts 28:10) 
After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.

(Acts 28:11) 
They honored us with many honors, and when we set sail, they put on board whatever we needed.

(Acts 28:12) 
After three months, we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island. It had the figurehead of the twin gods, Castor and Pollux.

(Acts 28:13) 
We put in at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.

(Acts 28:14) 
From there we sailed along and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and we reached Puteoli.

(Acts 28:15) 
There we found some brothers and sisters and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.

(Acts 28:16) 
The brothers and sisters there heard that we were coming and came as far as the Market of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

(Acts 28:17) 
When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.

(Acts 28:18) 
After three days, Paul called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, “Brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.

(Acts 28:19) 
The Romans, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.

(Acts 28:20) 
But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar—not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.

(Acts 28:21) 
For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you. For it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”

(Acts 28:22) 
They replied, “We have neither received any letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any of the brothers come here to report or speak any evil about you.

(Acts 28:23) 
But we want to hear from you what you think, for we know that this sect is spoken against everywhere.”

(Acts 28:24) 
So they arranged a day with him, and they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. He was explaining things to them, and he was testifying about the kingdom of God. From morning until evening, he was trying to convince them about Jesus, using the Law of Moses and the Prophets.

(Acts 28:25) 
Some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.

(Acts 28:26) 
They disagreed among themselves and began to leave, after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah, saying,

(Acts 28:27) 
‘Go to this people and say: “You will keep on hearing, but will never understand; you will keep on seeing, but will never perceive.

(Acts 28:28) 
For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes, so that they might not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.’

(Acts 28:29) 
Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!”

(Acts 28:30) 
Paul spent two whole years in his own rented house, and he welcomed all who visited him,

(Acts 28:31) 
proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.

(Romans 1:1) 
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God,

(Romans 1:2) 
which God had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,

(Romans 1:3) 
concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,

(Romans 1:4) 
who was appointed the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord,

(Romans 1:5) 
through whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name's sake,

(Romans 1:6) 
among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ:

(Romans 1:7) 
To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 1:8) 
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.

(Romans 1:9) 
For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,

(Romans 1:10) 
always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.

(Romans 1:11) 
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;

(Romans 1:12) 
that is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.

(Romans 1:13) 
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

(Romans 1:14) 
To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.

(Romans 1:15) 
So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.

(Romans 1:16) 
For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.

(Romans 1:17) 
For in it the justice of God is revealed, from faith unto faith: as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.

(Romans 1:18) 
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice.

(Romans 1:19) 
Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.

(Romans 1:20) 
For the invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.

(Romans 1:21) 
Because that, when they had known God, they have not glorified Him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened.

(Romans 1:22) 
For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.

(Romans 1:23) 
And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts, and of serpents.

(Romans 1:24) 
Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.

(Romans 1:25) 
Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed for ever. Amen.

(Romans 1:26) 
For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.

(Romans 1:27) 
And the men in like manner, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.

(Romans 1:28) 
And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient;

(Romans 1:29) 
Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

(Romans 1:30) 
Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

(Romans 1:31) 
Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.

(Romans 1:32) 
Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.

(Romans 2:1) 
You, therefore, are without excuse, every man who judges others. In that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you practice the same sins that you judge.

(Romans 2:2) 
We know that God’s judgment is according to truth against those who commit such sins.

(Romans 2:3) 
Do you think that you, a man who judges those who do such things, yet practices them yourself, will escape the judgment of God?

(Romans 2:4) 
Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Do you not know that God’s goodness is meant to lead you to repentance?

(Romans 2:5) 
But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment is revealed.

(Romans 2:6) 
He will render to each one according to his deeds.

(Romans 2:7) 
To those who by patiently doing good works seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.

(Romans 2:8) 
But to those who are contentious and who do not obey the truth, but believe in wickedness, there will be wrath and indignation.

(Romans 2:9) 
Tribulation and anguish will come upon every soul of man who does evil, first to the Jew and also to the Greek.

(Romans 2:10) 
But glory and honor and peace will be given to everyone who does good, first to the Jew and also to the Greek.

(Romans 2:11) 
For there is no respect of persons with God.

(Romans 2:12) 
For as many as have sinned without the Law will perish without the Law, and as many as have sinned in the Law will be judged by the Law.

(Romans 2:13) 
For it is not the hearers of the Law who are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the Law who will be justified.

(Romans 2:14) 
For when the Gentiles, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things that are in the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves.

(Romans 2:15) 
They show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or even excusing one another.

(Romans 2:16) 
This will take place on the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Gospel, through Jesus Christ.

(Romans 2:17) 
Indeed, if you are called a Jew, and you rest in the Law, and you glory in God,

(Romans 2:18) 
and you know His will, and you approve the things that are more important, being instructed by the Law,

(Romans 2:19) 
you trust that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,

(Romans 2:20) 
a teacher of the foolish, a master of the young, possessing the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law.

(Romans 2:21) 
You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one should not steal, do you steal?

(Romans 2:22) 
You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?

(Romans 2:23) 
You who glory in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?

(Romans 2:24) 
As it is written: “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”

(Romans 2:25) 
Circumcision indeed profits if you do the Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.

(Romans 2:26) 
If therefore the uncircumcised keep the just requirements of the Law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?

(Romans 2:27) 
And that which is by nature uncircumcised, fulfilling the Law, will judge you who are a transgressor of the Law, though you have the letter and circumcision.

(Romans 2:28) 
For it is not the one who is a Jew outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outwardly in the flesh,

(Romans 2:29) 
but the one who is a Jew inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not from men but from God.

(Romans 3:1) 
So then, what advantage does a Jew have? What is the value of circumcision?

(Romans 3:2) 
Much in every way! First, because the very words of God were entrusted to them.

(Romans 3:3) 
What if some of them were unfaithful? Does their unfaithfulness make God’s faithfulness of no effect?

(Romans 3:4) 
Certainly not! Rather, God is true, but every man is a liar, as it is written: “That you may be justified in your words, and may overcome when you are judged.”

(Romans 3:5) 
But if our wickedness commends the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who inflicts wrath?

(Romans 3:6) 
I speak in a human way. Certainly not! Otherwise, how would God judge the world?

(Romans 3:7) 
For if the truth of God has increased through my lie to His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?

(Romans 3:8) 
And why not say, as we are blasphemously accused, and as some affirm that we say, “Let us do evil, that good may come”? Their condemnation is just.

(Romans 3:9) 
What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have previously charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,

(Romans 3:10) 
as it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.”

(Romans 3:11) 
“All have turned aside; together they have become useless; there is no one who does good, there is not even one.”

(Romans 3:12) 
“Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.”

(Romans 3:13) 
“Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood,”

(Romans 3:14) 
“Ruin and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace they have not known.”

(Romans 3:15) 
“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

(Romans 3:16) 
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and all the world may become subject to God.

(Romans 3:17) 
Therefore by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, because through the law comes the knowledge of sin.

(Romans 3:18) 
But now the justice of God has been revealed apart from the law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets,

(Romans 3:19) 
the justice of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and upon all who believe. For there is no distinction,

(Romans 3:20) 
for all have sinned and are deprived of the glory of God,

(Romans 3:21) 
and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,

(Romans 3:22) 
whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His justice, because in His divine forbearance He had passed over former sins,

(Romans 3:23) 
to demonstrate His justice at the present time, so that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

(Romans 3:24) 
Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.

(Romans 3:25) 
For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.

(Romans 3:26) 
Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.

(Romans 3:27) 
Do we then nullify the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.

(Romans 4:1) 
What then are we to say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered?

(Romans 4:2) 
If Abraham was justified by works, he would have something to boast about, but not before God.

(Romans 4:3) 
What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

(Romans 4:4) 
Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a favor, but as something owed.

(Romans 4:5) 
But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.

(Romans 4:6) 
David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:

(Romans 4:7) 
“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

(Romans 4:8) 
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.”

(Romans 4:9) 
Is this blessedness then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.

(Romans 4:10) 
How then was it credited? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before he was circumcised? It was not after he had been circumcised, but before.

(Romans 4:11) 
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, so that righteousness might be credited to them also.

(Romans 4:12) 
And he is the father of the circumcised, who are not merely circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while still uncircumcised.

(Romans 4:13) 
For the promise to Abraham and his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.

(Romans 4:14) 
For if those who are of the Law are heirs, then faith is made void, and the promise is nullified.

(Romans 4:15) 
For the Law brings about wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.

(Romans 4:16) 
For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,

(Romans 4:17) 
(as it is written, “A father of many nations I have made you”) in the sight of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.

(Romans 4:18) 
In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So shall your descendants be.”

(Romans 4:19) 
Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;

(Romans 4:20) 
yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,

(Romans 4:21) 
and being fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.

(Romans 4:22) 
Therefore it was also credited to him as righteousness.

(Romans 4:23) 
Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him,

(Romans 4:24) 
but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,

(Romans 4:25) 
He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.

(Romans 5:1) 
Having been made righteous by faith, we now have peace with God through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 5:2) 
Through Him, we also have access by faith to this grace where we stand. And we also rejoice in the hope of the glory of the children of God.

(Romans 5:3) 
But not only this, we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,

(Romans 5:4) 
and endurance produces proven character, and character, hope.

(Romans 5:5) 
And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

(Romans 5:6) 
For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.

(Romans 5:7) 
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone might dare to die.

(Romans 5:8) 
But God proves His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

(Romans 5:9) 
Since therefore we have now been made righteous by His blood, we will be saved through Him from God's judgment.

(Romans 5:10) 
For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more now that we are reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.

(Romans 5:11) 
Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through Our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

(Romans 5:12) 
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.

(Romans 5:13) 
For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law.

(Romans 5:14) 
Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of the One who was to come.

(Romans 5:15) 
But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one man many died, how much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many!

(Romans 5:16) 
And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.

(Romans 5:17) 
For if by the one man's trespass death reigned through that one, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one Jesus Christ.

(Romans 5:18) 
Therefore, as through one man's trespass there came condemnation for all men, so also through one righteous act there came justification for all men, resulting in life.

(Romans 5:19) 
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one man's obedience many will be made righteous.

(Romans 5:20) 
Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,

(Romans 5:21) 
so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 6:1) 
So what should we say? Should we continue to sin, so that grace will increase?

(Romans 6:2) 
Absolutely not! If we are dead to sin, how can we continue to live in it?

(Romans 6:3) 
Don’t you know that all of us who were baptized in Christ Jesus were baptized in His death?

(Romans 6:4) 
Through baptism we were buried with Him in death, so that as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might live a new life.

(Romans 6:5) 
For if we have been united with Him in His death, we will certainly also be in His resurrection.

(Romans 6:6) 
We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.

(Romans 6:7) 
Because someone who is dead has been freed from sin.

(Romans 6:8) 
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.

(Romans 6:9) 
For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.

(Romans 6:10) 
The death that He died, He died to sin, once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives for God.

(Romans 6:11) 
So you also should consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 6:12) 
Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its passions.

(Romans 6:13) 
Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer your members to God as instruments of righteousness.

(Romans 6:14) 
For sin will no longer rule over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.

(Romans 6:15) 
So what? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!

(Romans 6:16) 
Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey—either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?

(Romans 6:17) 
But thanks be to God, that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching to which you were committed.

(Romans 6:18) 
Having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.

(Romans 6:19) 
I am using an example from ordinary human life because of your weakness. For just as you presented your members as slaves of impurity and of lawlessness, leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness, leading to sanctification.

(Romans 6:20) 
When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.

(Romans 6:21) 
But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

(Romans 6:22) 
But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God, you have your fruit, leading to sanctification; the end is eternal life.

(Romans 6:23) 
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 7:1) 
Do you not know, brothers—I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law governs a man for as long as he lives?

(Romans 7:2) 
For a woman who is married is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.

(Romans 7:3) 
Accordingly, if she associates with another man while her husband is still alive, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is released from that law, so that she is not an adulteress when she marries another man.

(Romans 7:4) 
Therefore, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, that you may belong to another, to him who has risen from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.

(Romans 7:5) 
For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.

(Romans 7:6) 
But now we are released from the law, because we died to that which held us captive, so that we may serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.

(Romans 7:7) 
What then shall we say? Is the law sin? By no means! Yet, I did not come to know sin except through the law. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”

(Romans 7:8) 
But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin was dead.

(Romans 7:9) 
I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive,

(Romans 7:10) 
and I died. And the very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.

(Romans 7:11) 
For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.

(Romans 7:12) 
So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.

(Romans 7:13) 
Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.

(Romans 7:14) 
For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.

(Romans 7:15) 
For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.

(Romans 7:16) 
Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.

(Romans 7:17) 
So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

(Romans 7:18) 
For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.

(Romans 7:19) 
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.

(Romans 7:20) 
Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

(Romans 7:21) 
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.

(Romans 7:22) 
For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,

(Romans 7:23) 
but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.

(Romans 7:24) 
Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?

(Romans 7:25) 
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

(Romans 8:1) 
There is, therefore, no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not live according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

(Romans 8:2) 
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.

(Romans 8:3) 
For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,

(Romans 8:4) 
that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

(Romans 8:5) 
For those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.

(Romans 8:6) 
For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.

(Romans 8:7) 
Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.

(Romans 8:8) 
And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

(Romans 8:9) 
But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.

(Romans 8:10) 
And if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

(Romans 8:11) 
And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who dwells in you.

(Romans 8:12) 
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.

(Romans 8:13) 
For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the flesh, you will live.

(Romans 8:14) 
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

(Romans 8:15) 
For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry out: Abba (Father).

(Romans 8:16) 
For the Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.

(Romans 8:17) 
And if children, then heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so if we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him.

(Romans 8:18) 
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.

(Romans 8:19) 
For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.

(Romans 8:20) 
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope:

(Romans 8:21) 
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.

(Romans 8:22) 
For we know that every creature groans and is in pain until now.

(Romans 8:23) 
And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.

(Romans 8:24) 
For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he hope for?

(Romans 8:25) 
But if we hope for that which we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

(Romans 8:26) 
Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmity. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself asks for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

(Romans 8:27) 
And He Who searches the hearts knows what the Spirit desires; because He asks for the saints according to God.

(Romans 8:28) 
And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.

(Romans 8:29) 
For those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

(Romans 8:30) 
And whom he predestined, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

(Romans 8:31) 
What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?

(Romans 8:32) 
He that spared not even His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not also, with Him, given us all things?

(Romans 8:33) 
Who shall bring a charge against the elect of God? It is God Who justifies.

(Romans 8:34) 
Who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus Who has died, yes, Who is risen again, Who is at the right hand of God, Who also makes intercession for us.

(Romans 8:35) 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or persecution? or famine? or nakedness? or peril? or the sword?

(Romans 8:36) 
As it is written: For Your sake we are put to death all the day long: we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.

(Romans 8:37) 
But in all these things, we overcome, because of Him Who loved us.

(Romans 8:38) 
For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,

(Romans 8:39) 
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

(Romans 9:1) 
I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, because my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit,

(Romans 9:2) 
because I feel great sadness, and constant grief in my heart.

(Romans 9:3) 
I pray that I myself could be cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood, the Jews:

(Romans 9:4) 
who are Israelites; to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the worship, and the promises:

(Romans 9:5) 
to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, came Christ. May God, Who is over all, be blessed forever. Amen.

(Romans 9:6) 
But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are from Israel are truly Israel,

(Romans 9:7) 
and not all of Abraham’s descendants are his children, but “through Isaac shall your descendants be named.”

(Romans 9:8) 
This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.

(Romans 9:9) 
For the word of promise was this: “About this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”

(Romans 9:10) 
And not only that, but also Rebecca, when she had conceived children by one husband, our father Isaac,

(Romans 9:11) 
(though they were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad) so that God’s purpose of election might continue,

(Romans 9:12) 
not because of works but because of the One who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”

(Romans 9:13) 
As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”

(Romans 9:14) 
What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not.

(Romans 9:15) 
For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”

(Romans 9:16) 
So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, Who has mercy.

(Romans 9:17) 
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”

(Romans 9:18) 
So then He has mercy on whomever He wills, and He hardens whomever He wills.

(Romans 9:19) 
You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?”

(Romans 9:20) 
But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?”

(Romans 9:21) 
Does not the potter have power over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?

(Romans 9:22) 
What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known His power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,

(Romans 9:23) 
in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy, which He has prepared beforehand for glory—

(Romans 9:24) 
even us whom He has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?

(Romans 9:25) 
As indeed He says in Hosea, “Those who were not My people I will call ‘My people,’ and she who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”

(Romans 9:26) 
“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ there they will be called sons of the living God.”

(Romans 9:27) 
And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant of them will be saved,

(Romans 9:28) 
for the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth in righteousness and quickly.”

(Romans 9:29) 
And as Isaiah predicted, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us offspring, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”

(Romans 9:30) 
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith,

(Romans 9:31) 
but that Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, did not attain that law.

(Romans 9:32) 
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,

(Romans 9:33) 
as it is written, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame.”

(Romans 10:1) 
Brothers and sisters, I have a heartfelt desire for the salvation of those in Israel, and I pray to God for them.

(Romans 10:2) 
For I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to the knowledge of God.

(Romans 10:3) 
For they do not understand the righteousness of God, and they want to establish their own, and so they are not obedient to the righteousness of God.

(Romans 10:4) 
For Christ is the fulfillment of the Law, bringing righteousness to everyone who believes.

(Romans 10:5) 
For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”

(Romans 10:6) 
But the righteousness that comes from faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into the universe?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down).

(Romans 10:7) 
“Or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).

(Romans 10:8) 
But what does it say? “The Son is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” (that is, the word of faith that we preach).

(Romans 10:9) 
Because, if you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

(Romans 10:10) 
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

(Romans 10:11) 
For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”

(Romans 10:12) 
For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, rich unto all who call upon Him.

(Romans 10:13) 
For whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

(Romans 10:14) 
How, then, can they call on Him whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

(Romans 10:15) 
And how are they to preach unless they are sent on a mission by God? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring good news!”

(Romans 10:16) 
But not all have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”

(Romans 10:17) 
So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

(Romans 10:18) 
But I ask: Did they not hear? Yes, truly, their sound went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.

(Romans 10:19) 
But I ask: Did Israel not know? First Moses says, “I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will provoke you.”

(Romans 10:20) 
Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”

(Romans 10:21) 
But to Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”

(Romans 11:1) 
So here’s what I mean: Did God reject His people? Absolutely not! I, too, am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.

(Romans 11:2) 
God didn't reject His people, whom He knew ahead of time. Don't you know what Scripture says about Elijah? He pleaded with God against Israel, saying:

(Romans 11:3) 
“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.”

(Romans 11:4) 
But what was the divine answer to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bent the knee to Baal.”

(Romans 11:5) 
So, in the same way, at the present time there is a remnant, a remnant who were saved by the grace of God.

(Romans 11:6) 
Now, if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.

(Romans 11:7) 
What then? What Israel was seeking, it has not obtained, but the elect have obtained it; the rest were blinded.

(Romans 11:8) 
(As it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.”)

(Romans 11:9) 
And David says: “Let their table become a snare before them, a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution for them.

(Romans 11:10) 
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and their backs bowed down always.”

(Romans 11:11) 
So I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Absolutely not! But because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel envious.

(Romans 11:12) 
Now if their transgression means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness bring?

(Romans 11:13) 
Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,

(Romans 11:14) 
in the hope that I may provoke my own flesh to envy and save some of them.

(Romans 11:15) 
For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?

(Romans 11:16) 
If the first fruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.

(Romans 11:17) 
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,

(Romans 11:18) 
do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.

(Romans 11:19) 
Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”

(Romans 11:20) 
That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not be arrogant, but fear.

(Romans 11:21) 
For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He will not spare you either.

(Romans 11:22) 
See then the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.

(Romans 11:23) 
And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

(Romans 11:24) 
For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?

(Romans 11:25) 
I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you will not be conceited: A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.

(Romans 11:26) 
And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will banish ungodliness from Jacob.”

(Romans 11:27) 
“And this will be My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”

(Romans 11:28) 
As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.

(Romans 11:29) 
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

(Romans 11:30) 
For just as you disobeyed God in the past but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,

(Romans 11:31) 
so they too have now disobeyed, so that by the mercy shown to you, they also may now receive mercy.

(Romans 11:32) 
For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He may have mercy on all.

(Romans 11:33) 
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!

(Romans 11:34) 
“For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor?”

(Romans 11:35) 
“Or who has first given to Him, that He should be repaid?”

(Romans 11:36) 
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be glory forever. Amen.

(Romans 12:1) 
Therefore, brothers, I implore you by God's compassion: offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God. This is your true worship.

(Romans 12:2) 
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind. Then you will be able to discern the will of God—what is good, pleasing, and perfect.

(Romans 12:3) 
For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned.

(Romans 12:4) 
For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,

(Romans 12:5) 
so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.

(Romans 12:6) 
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;

(Romans 12:7) 
if service, in service; the one who teaches, in teaching;

(Romans 12:8) 
the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with diligence; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.

(Romans 12:9) 
Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good.

(Romans 12:10) 
Love one another with brotherly affection; outdo one another in showing honor.

(Romans 12:11) 
Never flag in zeal, be aglow with the Spirit, serve the Lord.

(Romans 12:12) 
Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.

(Romans 12:13) 
Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.

(Romans 12:14) 
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.

(Romans 12:15) 
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.

(Romans 12:16) 
Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; never be wise in your own sight.

(Romans 12:17) 
Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.

(Romans 12:18) 
If possible, so far as it depends upon you, live peaceably with all.

(Romans 12:19) 
Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.

(Romans 12:20) 
To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”

(Romans 12:21) 
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

(Romans 13:1) 
Everyone should be obedient to the governing authorities. No authority exists that doesn’t come from God. The authorities that do exist are established by God.

(Romans 13:2) 
Consequently, whoever resists authority is resisting God’s will, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.

(Romans 13:3) 
Leaders are not a terror to good behavior, but to evil. Would you like to be unafraid of authority? Do good, and you will have praise from it.

(Romans 13:4) 
For the governing authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do evil, be afraid, for the authority doesn’t carry the sword for nothing. It is God’s servant to execute wrath on anyone who does evil.

(Romans 13:5) 
So it is necessary to be obedient, not only because of God's wrath, but also because of your conscience.

(Romans 13:6) 
For this reason you also pay taxes. For the authorities are ministers of God, serving you by these things.

(Romans 13:7) 
Give to everyone what is owed: Taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.

(Romans 13:8) 
Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another. For whoever loves their neighbor has fulfilled the Law.

(Romans 13:9) 
For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Romans 13:10) 
Love does no evil to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.

(Romans 13:11) 
Do this, knowing the time. It is now the hour to awaken from sleep. For salvation is closer to us now than when we first believed.

(Romans 13:12) 
The night is far gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of light.

(Romans 13:13) 
Let us walk honestly, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual relations and indecency, not in strife and envy.

(Romans 13:14) 
Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its desires.

(Romans 14:1) 
Welcome those who are weak in the faith, but do not argue about questionable matters.

(Romans 14:2) 
One person believes he can eat anything. Someone who is weak, however, eats only vegetables.

(Romans 14:3) 
The one who eats should not despise the one who does not. The one who does not eat should not judge the one who does. God welcomes both.

(Romans 14:4) 
Who are you to judge someone else's servant? The servant stands or falls before his own master. And he will stand, for God has the power to make him stand.

(Romans 14:5) 
One person values one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.

(Romans 14:6) 
The one who values the day, does so in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.

(Romans 14:7) 
For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself.

(Romans 14:8) 
If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.

(Romans 14:9) 
For this is why Christ died and came back to life, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.

(Romans 14:10) 
But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

(Romans 14:11) 
For it is written: “As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will give praise to God.”

(Romans 14:12) 
So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.

(Romans 14:13) 
Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.

(Romans 14:14) 
I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.

(Romans 14:15) 
For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.

(Romans 14:16) 
So do not let your good be slandered.

(Romans 14:17) 
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 14:18) 
For whoever serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.

(Romans 14:19) 
So then, let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.

(Romans 14:20) 
Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. All things indeed are clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make others stumble by what he eats.

(Romans 14:21) 
It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles.

(Romans 14:22) 
The faith that you have, have as your own conviction before God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in what he approves.

(Romans 14:23) 
But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.

(Romans 15:1) 
And we who are strong in faith must bear with the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not seek to please ourselves.

(Romans 15:2) 
Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, for building up.

(Romans 15:3) 
For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The reproaches of those who reproach You fell on Me.”

(Romans 15:4) 
For whatever things were written, were written for our teaching, that through patience and the consolation of the Scriptures, we may have hope.

(Romans 15:5) 
Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be of one mind with one another, according to Jesus Christ:

(Romans 15:6) 
That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Romans 15:7) 
Therefore, receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.

(Romans 15:8) 
For I say that Christ Jesus has been a servant to the circumcision for the sake of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the fathers,

(Romans 15:9) 
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: “Therefore I will give thanks to You among the Gentiles, and sing to Your name.”

(Romans 15:10) 
And again, he says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”

(Romans 15:11) 
And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him.”

(Romans 15:12) 
And again, Isaiah says: “There shall be the root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles shall hope.”

(Romans 15:13) 
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 15:14) 
And I myself am confident concerning you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.

(Romans 15:15) 
But I have written to you more boldly, brothers, in some measure, as recalling you to your minds, because of the grace given to me by God,

(Romans 15:16) 
That I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, sanctifying the Gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

(Romans 15:17) 
Therefore, I have glory in Christ Jesus concerning the things of God.

(Romans 15:18) 
For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,

(Romans 15:19) 
In the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fulfilled the Gospel of Christ.

(Romans 15:20) 
And I have preached the Gospel in this way, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another’s foundation,

(Romans 15:21) 
But as it is written: “They to whom He was not announced, shall see: and those who have not heard, shall understand.”

(Romans 15:22) 
Because of this also I have been hindered many times from coming to you.

(Romans 15:23) 
But now, not having any more place in these regions, and having a desire to come to you for many years,

(Romans 15:24) 
Whenever I go to Spain, I hope that by passing through you, I may see you and be helped on my way there by you, after I have first enjoyed your company for a while.

(Romans 15:25) 
But now I am going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.

(Romans 15:26) 
For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.

(Romans 15:27) 
For it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they also ought to minister to them in material things.

(Romans 15:28) 
Therefore, when I have finished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will pass through you into Spain.

(Romans 15:29) 
But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

(Romans 15:30) 
Now I beg you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,

(Romans 15:31) 
That I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints.

(Romans 15:32) 
That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.

(Romans 15:33) 
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

(Romans 16:1) 
I commend to you Phoebe, a sister of ours who serves the church in Cenchrae:

(Romans 16:2) 
Welcome her in the Lord, as is fitting for the saints. Assist her with whatever business she needs. She has been a patron of many, including me.

(Romans 16:3) 
Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

(Romans 16:4) 
who risked their necks for my life. I thank not only them but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

(Romans 16:5) 
Also greet the church that meets in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first in Asia to believe in Christ.

(Romans 16:6) 
Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.

(Romans 16:7) 
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and fellow prisoners, who are well-known among the apostles and were in Christ before I was.

(Romans 16:8) 
Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.

(Romans 16:9) 
Greet Urban, our fellow worker in Christ Jesus, and my beloved Stachys.

(Romans 16:10) 
Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those of the household of Aristobulus.

(Romans 16:11) 
Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.

(Romans 16:12) 
Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.

(Romans 16:13) 
Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

(Romans 16:14) 
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them.

(Romans 16:15) 
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.

(Romans 16:16) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.

(Romans 16:17) 
Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned, and turn away from them.

(Romans 16:18) 
For such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and they deceive the hearts of the innocent with smooth talk and flattery.

(Romans 16:19) 
Your obedience has become known to everyone. Therefore, I rejoice over you, and I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.

(Romans 16:20) 
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

(Romans 16:21) 
Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives, greet you.

(Romans 16:22) 
I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord.

(Romans 16:23) 
Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you.

(Romans 16:24) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.

(Romans 16:25) 
Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret for ages,

(Romans 16:26) 
but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations—

(Romans 16:27) 
to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen.

(1 Corinthians 1:1) 
Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother, 

(1 Corinthians 1:2) 
to the Church of God in Corinth: to those who are consecrated to Christ Jesus, called to be holy, and to all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place, their place and ours: 

(1 Corinthians 1:3) 
Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:4) 
I give thanks to my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus:

(1 Corinthians 1:5) 
that in everything you have been enriched in Him, in all speech and in all knowledge;

(1 Corinthians 1:6) 
just as the testimony of Christ has been confirmed in you:

(1 Corinthians 1:7) 
so that you are not lacking in any grace, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:8) 
He will also strengthen you until the end, blameless in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 1:9) 
God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

(1 Corinthians 1:10) 
Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment.

(1 Corinthians 1:11) 
For it has been signified to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

(1 Corinthians 1:12) 
Now this I say, that each of you says: "I am of Paul," and "I am of Apollos," and "I am of Cephas," and "I am of Christ."

(1 Corinthians 1:13) 
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?

(1 Corinthians 1:14) 
I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,

(1 Corinthians 1:15) 
lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.

(1 Corinthians 1:16) 
And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other.

(1 Corinthians 1:17) 
For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the Gospel: not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be emptied.

(1 Corinthians 1:18) 
For the word of the cross, to those who are perishing, is foolishness; but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.

(1 Corinthians 1:19) 
For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will reject the prudence of the prudent."

(1 Corinthians 1:20) 
Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

(1 Corinthians 1:21) 
For since, in God's wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching.

(1 Corinthians 1:22) 
For indeed, the Jews seek signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom:

(1 Corinthians 1:23) 
but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness,

(1 Corinthians 1:24) 
but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

(1 Corinthians 1:25) 
Because that which is foolish of God is wiser than men, and that which is weak of God is stronger than men.

(1 Corinthians 1:26) 
For consider your calling, brothers, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not many noble:

(1 Corinthians 1:27) 
but God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God chose the weak things of the world to confound the strong:

(1 Corinthians 1:28) 
and the base things of the world and the things that are despised God has chosen, and those things that are not, to bring to nothing those things that are:

(1 Corinthians 1:29) 
so that no flesh should glory in His sight.

(1 Corinthians 1:30) 
But of Him, you are in Christ Jesus, Who has been made our wisdom from God, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:

(1 Corinthians 1:31) 
so that, as it is written: "Let him who glories, glory in the Lord."

(1 Corinthians 2:1) 
And when I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with fancy words or human wisdom, when I told you about the testimony of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 2:2) 
For I decided that I would know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.

(1 Corinthians 2:3) 
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in great trembling.

(1 Corinthians 2:4) 
And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

(1 Corinthians 2:5) 
so that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:6) 
However, we speak wisdom among those who are spiritually mature: but the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are being destroyed,

(1 Corinthians 2:7) 
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which has been hidden, which God foreordained before the ages for our glory:

(1 Corinthians 2:8) 
which none of the rulers of this age knew; for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

(1 Corinthians 2:9) 
But as it is written, “What the eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.”

(1 Corinthians 2:10) 
But God has revealed to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:11) 
For who of men knows what is in a man, except the spirit of a man that is in him? So also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.

(1 Corinthians 2:12) 
Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God:

(1 Corinthians 2:13) 
And we speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual ones.

(1 Corinthians 2:14) 
The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

(1 Corinthians 2:15) 
But he that is spiritual judges all things; yet he himself is judged by no one.

(1 Corinthians 2:16) 
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 3:1) 
And I, brothers, couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to those of the flesh, as to babies in Christ.

(1 Corinthians 3:2) 
I gave you milk to drink, not solid food. You couldn’t yet digest the harder truths of the Gospel. And you still aren’t able, for you still aren’t capable of it.

(1 Corinthians 3:3) 
For you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and fighting among you, aren’t you carnal, and do you walk according to worldly standards?

(1 Corinthians 3:4) 
For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” aren’t you merely men?

(1 Corinthians 3:5) 
So what then is Paul? And what is Apollos? They are ministers through whom you believed, and to each one as the Lord gave to him.

(1 Corinthians 3:6) 
I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

(1 Corinthians 3:7) 
So neither the one who plants is anything, nor the one who waters, but God, who gives the increase.

(1 Corinthians 3:8) 
Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own work.

(1 Corinthians 3:9) 
For we are fellow workers with God. You are God's field, you are God's building.

(1 Corinthians 3:10) 
According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.

(1 Corinthians 3:11) 
For no one can lay any other foundation besides that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.

(1 Corinthians 3:12) 
Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

(1 Corinthians 3:13) 
the work of each one will be revealed. For the Day of the Lord will declare it, because it will be revealed in fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has built.

(1 Corinthians 3:14) 
If anyone's work remains which he has built on, he will receive a reward.

(1 Corinthians 3:15) 
If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

(1 Corinthians 3:16) 
Don’t you know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?

(1 Corinthians 3:17) 
If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.

(1 Corinthians 3:18) 
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.

(1 Corinthians 3:19) 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”

(1 Corinthians 3:20) 
And again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.”

(1 Corinthians 3:21) 
Therefore, let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:

(1 Corinthians 3:22) 
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future—all are yours,

(1 Corinthians 3:23) 
and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.

(1 Corinthians 4:1) 
Everyone should regard us as emissaries of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.

(1 Corinthians 4:2) 
Furthermore, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.

(1 Corinthians 4:3) 
It matters very little to me if I’m judged by you or by any human court. I don’t even judge myself.

(1 Corinthians 4:4) 
I’m not aware of anything I’ve done wrong, but that doesn’t mean I’m right. The Lord is the one who will judge me.

(1 Corinthians 4:5) 
So don’t make judgments before the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will reveal the motives of the heart. Then each person will receive their praise from God.

(1 Corinthians 4:6) 
Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn through us not to go beyond what is written, so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against the other.

(1 Corinthians 4:7) 
For who makes you different from others? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?

(1 Corinthians 4:8) 
Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings—and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings, so that we also might rule with you!

(1 Corinthians 4:9) 
For it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as men condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.

(1 Corinthians 4:10) 
We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!

(1 Corinthians 4:11) 
To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, and homeless.

(1 Corinthians 4:12) 
We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;

(1 Corinthians 4:13) 
when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.

(1 Corinthians 4:14) 
I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.

(1 Corinthians 4:15) 
For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 4:16) 
Therefore I urge you to imitate me.

(1 Corinthians 4:17) 
For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, as I teach it everywhere in every church.

(1 Corinthians 4:18) 
Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.

(1 Corinthians 4:19) 
But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people say, but also what power they have.

(1 Corinthians 4:20) 
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk, but of power.

(1 Corinthians 4:21) 
What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or shall I come with love and with a gentle spirit?

(1 Corinthians 5:1) 
It is reported that there is unchastity among you, and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles, so that a man has his father's wife.

(1 Corinthians 5:2) 
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you?

(1 Corinthians 5:3) 
I indeed, being absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him who has so done,

(1 Corinthians 5:4) 
In the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of Our Lord Jesus,

(1 Corinthians 5:5) 
To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of Our Lord Jesus.

(1 Corinthians 5:6) 
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump?

(1 Corinthians 5:7) 
Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover is sacrificed.

(1 Corinthians 5:8) 
Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

(1 Corinthians 5:9) 
I wrote to you in an epistle: Not to keep company with fornicators.

(1 Corinthians 5:10) 
I meant not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the idolaters; otherwise you must have gone out of this world.

(1 Corinthians 5:11) 
But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one do not eat.

(1 Corinthians 5:12) 
For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do you not judge them that are within?

(1 Corinthians 5:13) 
For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.

(1 Corinthians 6:1) 
Does anyone among you, who has a case against another, dare to go to court before the unbelievers, and not before the saints?

(1 Corinthians 6:2) 
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

(1 Corinthians 6:3) 
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more things of this world?

(1 Corinthians 6:4) 
So if you have worldly judgements, then appoint those who are least esteemed in the Church to judge these matters.

(1 Corinthians 6:5) 
I speak this to your shame. Is there not a wise man among you who can judge between his brother and his brother?

(1 Corinthians 6:6) 
But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.

(1 Corinthians 6:7) 
Now indeed there is utter failure among you, because you have lawsuits with one another. Why do you not rather suffer wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?

(1 Corinthians 6:8) 
But you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that among your brothers.

(1 Corinthians 6:9) 
Do you not know that the unjust will not possess the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,

(1 Corinthians 6:10) 
nor the effeminate, nor those who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will possess the kingdom of God.

(1 Corinthians 6:11) 
And such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.

(1 Corinthians 6:12) 
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.

(1 Corinthians 6:13) 
Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

(1 Corinthians 6:14) 
And God raised up the Lord, and He will also raise us up by His power.

(1 Corinthians 6:15) 
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.

(1 Corinthians 6:16) 
Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? For “the two,” He says, “shall be one flesh.”

(1 Corinthians 6:17) 
But he who is joined to God is one spirit with Him.

(1 Corinthians 6:18) 
Flee from fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.

(1 Corinthians 6:19) 
Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?

(1 Corinthians 6:20) 
For you were bought at a great price. Therefore glorify God in your body.

(1 Corinthians 7:1) 
Concerning the things you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman, which means not to engage in sexual relations.

(1 Corinthians 7:2) 
But in order to avoid the temptation of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:3) 
Let the husband give to the wife what is owed to her; and in the same way, let the wife give what is owed to the husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:4) 
The wife does not have power over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have power over his own body, but the wife does.

(1 Corinthians 7:5) 
Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to prayer. Return to each other, so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

(1 Corinthians 7:6) 
Now I say this as a concession, not as a command.

(1 Corinthians 7:7) 
For I wish that all men were like myself. But each one has his own gift from God: one in this way, and another in that.

(1 Corinthians 7:8) 
But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain as I do.

(1 Corinthians 7:9) 
But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.

(1 Corinthians 7:10) 
But to those who are joined in marriage, I command—not I, but the Lord: that a wife should not depart from her husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:11) 
But if she departs, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband divorce his wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:12) 
To the rest I say—not the Lord—that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, let him not divorce her.

(1 Corinthians 7:13) 
And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, let her not divorce the husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:14) 
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.

(1 Corinthians 7:15) 
But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not subject to servitude in such cases. But God has called us to peace.

(1 Corinthians 7:16) 
For how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?

(1 Corinthians 7:17) 
But as God has allotted to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And this is what I teach in all the churches.

(1 Corinthians 7:18) 
Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not seek to reverse it. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.

(1 Corinthians 7:19) 
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is what matters.

(1 Corinthians 7:20) 
Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called.

(1 Corinthians 7:21) 
Were you called as a slave? Do not worry about it. But if you can become free, avail yourself of the opportunity.

(1 Corinthians 7:22) 
For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord; likewise, the one who was called as a free man is a slave of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 7:23) 
You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.

(1 Corinthians 7:24) 
So then, brothers, in whatever state each was called, there let him remain with God.

(1 Corinthians 7:25) 
Now concerning virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give an opinion, as one who has received mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.

(1 Corinthians 7:26) 
I think then that this is good on account of the present distress, that it is good for a man to be as he is.

(1 Corinthians 7:27) 
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:28) 
But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such people will have trouble in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you.

(1 Corinthians 7:29) 
But this I say, brothers: the time is short. From now on, let those who have wives be as though they had none,

(1 Corinthians 7:30) 
and those who weep as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess,

(1 Corinthians 7:31) 
and those who make use of the world as though they did not make full use of it, for the form of this world is passing away.

(1 Corinthians 7:32) 
I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:33) 
But the one who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how to please his wife.

(1 Corinthians 7:34) 
And there is a division. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both body and spirit. But the one who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how to please her husband.

(1 Corinthians 7:35) 
I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is proper and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:36) 
If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do as he wishes; he does not sin; let them marry.

(1 Corinthians 7:37) 
But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no necessity, but having control over his own will, and has determined in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.

(1 Corinthians 7:38) 
So then, he who gives his virgin in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage does better.

(1 Corinthians 7:39) 
A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 7:40) 
But in my judgment, she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.

(1 Corinthians 8:1) 
Now about the things that have been sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge by itself causes pride, but charity builds up the Church.

(1 Corinthians 8:2) 
If anyone thinks he knows something, he doesn’t yet know it the way he should.

(1 Corinthians 8:3) 
But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.

(1 Corinthians 8:4) 
Concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God except for the One God.

(1 Corinthians 8:5) 
Even if there are those who are called gods, whether in the sky or on the earth, as there are many gods and many lords:

(1 Corinthians 8:6) 
For us, there is only one God the Father, from whom all things come and in whom we live; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and through whom we live.

(1 Corinthians 8:7) 
But not everyone has this knowledge. Some, through their attachment to idols, eat food that has been sacrificed to idols, and because their conscience is weak, they are defiled.

(1 Corinthians 8:8) 
Food does not recommend us to God. For if we eat, we are not better; and if we do not eat, we are not worse off.

(1 Corinthians 8:9) 
But be careful that your freedom of conscience does not become an occasion of stumbling for the weak.

(1 Corinthians 8:10) 
For if someone sees you who has knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, won’t the conscience of the weak man be emboldened to eat food sacrificed to idols?

(1 Corinthians 8:11) 
So by your knowledge, the weak brother will be destroyed, because Christ died for him.

(1 Corinthians 8:12) 
When you sin against your brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

(1 Corinthians 8:13) 
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, lest I cause my brother to stumble.

(1 Corinthians 9:1) 
Am I not an Apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ Our Lord? Are you not the fruit of my ministry in the Lord?

(1 Corinthians 9:2) 
Even if I am not an Apostle to others, I am certainly one to you. You are proof that I am an Apostle of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 9:3) 
To those who question me, this is my defense:

(1 Corinthians 9:4) 
Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

(1 Corinthians 9:5) 
Do we not have the right to take a wife, a sister in the faith, as do the other Apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

(1 Corinthians 9:6) 
Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right to stop working to support ourselves?

(1 Corinthians 9:7) 
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?

(1 Corinthians 9:8) 
Am I speaking merely as a man? Does not the Law also speak these things?

(1 Corinthians 9:9) 
For it is written in the Law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?

(1 Corinthians 9:10) 
Or does He speak entirely for our sake? Indeed, it was written for our sake, so that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes should thresh in hope of receiving a share of the harvest.

(1 Corinthians 9:11) 
If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things?

(1 Corinthians 9:12) 
If others share in your rights, why not even more so we? But we have not used this right. We endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.

(1 Corinthians 9:13) 
Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings?

(1 Corinthians 9:14) 
In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should live by the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 9:15) 
But I have not used any of these rights, nor am I writing this in order that it may be done for me. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.

(1 Corinthians 9:16) 
For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because an obligation is laid on me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!

(1 Corinthians 9:17) 
For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a commission.

(1 Corinthians 9:18) 
What then is my reward? That, in preaching the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.

(1 Corinthians 9:19) 
For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.

(1 Corinthians 9:20) 
To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.

(1 Corinthians 9:21) 
To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ), that I might win those outside the law.

(1 Corinthians 9:22) 
To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

(1 Corinthians 9:23) 
I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with it.

(1 Corinthians 9:24) 
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.

(1 Corinthians 9:25) 
Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.

(1 Corinthians 9:26) 
So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.

(1 Corinthians 9:27) 
But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.

(1 Corinthians 10:1) 
And so, my brothers, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers were under the protection of the cloud, and all crossed through the sea,

(1 Corinthians 10:2) 
and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea:

(1 Corinthians 10:3) 
and all ate the same spiritual food,

(1 Corinthians 10:4) 
and all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.

(1 Corinthians 10:5) 
But in many of them, God was not pleased; for they were struck down in the desert.

(1 Corinthians 10:6) 
These things happened as examples for us, so that we would not be eager for evil things, as they desired them.

(1 Corinthians 10:7) 
Do not become idolaters, as some of them did, as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.”

(1 Corinthians 10:8) 
Nor should we engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.

(1 Corinthians 10:9) 
Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.

(1 Corinthians 10:10) 
Nor should you grumble, as some of them grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.

(1 Corinthians 10:11) 
These things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.

(1 Corinthians 10:12) 
Therefore, let whoever thinks he stands, take heed that he does not fall.

(1 Corinthians 10:13) 
No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. But God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but with the temptation will also make a way out, that you may be able to endure it.

(1 Corinthians 10:14) 
Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.

(1 Corinthians 10:15) 
I speak as to the wise: judge for yourselves what I say.

(1 Corinthians 10:16) 
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the participation of the body of Christ?

(1 Corinthians 10:17) 
Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.

(1 Corinthians 10:18) 
Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

(1 Corinthians 10:19) 
What do I say then? That an idol is anything, or that which is sacrificed to idols is anything?

(1 Corinthians 10:20) 
No, but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to become partners with demons.

(1 Corinthians 10:21) 
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

(1 Corinthians 10:22) 
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?

(1 Corinthians 10:23) 
“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things edify.

(1 Corinthians 10:24) 
Let no one seek his own, but that of another.

(1 Corinthians 10:25) 
Eat anything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:26) 
“The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.”

(1 Corinthians 10:27) 
If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:28) 
But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake.

(1 Corinthians 10:29) 
I mean conscience, not your own, but the other person’s; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?

(1 Corinthians 10:30) 
If I partake with thanks, why am I blasphemed for that for which I give thanks?

(1 Corinthians 10:31) 
So then, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

(1 Corinthians 10:32) 
Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,

(1 Corinthians 10:33) 
just as I also please all men in everything, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

(1 Corinthians 11:1) 
Imitate me, even as I imitate Christ.

(1 Corinthians 11:2) 
I commend you, brothers, for always remembering me and for keeping the teachings that I handed down to you.

(1 Corinthians 11:3) 
I want you to understand this: every man has Christ as his head, a woman has a man as her head, and Christ has God as His head.

(1 Corinthians 11:4) 
Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.

(1 Corinthians 11:5) 
And any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, because it is as though she had her head shaved.

(1 Corinthians 11:6) 
For if a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, then she should cover it.

(1 Corinthians 11:7) 
A man, since he is the image and glory of God, shouldn't have his head covered. But woman is the glory of man.

(1 Corinthians 11:8) 
For man wasn't created from woman, but woman from man.

(1 Corinthians 11:9) 
Man wasn't created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.

(1 Corinthians 11:10) 
That is why a woman should have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.

(1 Corinthians 11:11) 
Nevertheless, neither is woman independent of man in the Lord, nor is man independent of woman.

(1 Corinthians 11:12) 
For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But all things are from God.

(1 Corinthians 11:13) 
Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

(1 Corinthians 11:14) 
Doesn't nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,

(1 Corinthians 11:15) 
but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair has been given to her for a covering.

(1 Corinthians 11:16) 
But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.

(1 Corinthians 11:17) 
But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better, but for the worse.

(1 Corinthians 11:18) 
For first of all, when you come together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.

(1 Corinthians 11:19) 
For there must be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be evident among you.

(1 Corinthians 11:20) 
So then, when you meet together, it is not really to eat the Lord's Supper.

(1 Corinthians 11:21) 
For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own supper, and one person is hungry while another is drunk.

(1 Corinthians 11:22) 
Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.

(1 Corinthians 11:23) 
For I received from the Lord what I also handed down to you: that the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread,

(1 Corinthians 11:24) 
and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

(1 Corinthians 11:25) 
In the same way He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

(1 Corinthians 11:26) 
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.

(1 Corinthians 11:27) 
Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 11:28) 
But a man must examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

(1 Corinthians 11:29) 
For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.

(1 Corinthians 11:30) 
For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are dying.

(1 Corinthians 11:31) 
But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.

(1 Corinthians 11:32) 
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned with the world.

(1 Corinthians 11:33) 
So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

(1 Corinthians 11:34) 
If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. And the remaining matters I will arrange when I come.

(1 Corinthians 12:1) 
Regarding spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.

(1 Corinthians 12:2) 
You know that when you were Gentiles, you were being led astray, running to idols, which cannot speak, as you were led.

(1 Corinthians 12:3) 
Therefore, I make it known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says: “Jesus is accursed.” And no one can say “Lord Jesus” except in the Holy Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:4) 
Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:5) 
And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.

(1 Corinthians 12:6) 
And there are varieties of workings, but it is the same God who works all things in all.

(1 Corinthians 12:7) 
To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.

(1 Corinthians 12:8) 
For to one, through the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:

(1 Corinthians 12:9) 
to another, faith in the same Spirit; to another, the grace of healings in the one Spirit:

(1 Corinthians 12:10) 
to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discernment of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of words.

(1 Corinthians 12:11) 
But all these things are worked by one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one individually as He wills.

(1 Corinthians 12:12) 
For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ.

(1 Corinthians 12:13) 
For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free; and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 12:14) 
For the body is not one member, but many.

(1 Corinthians 12:15) 
If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” it is not therefore not of the body?

(1 Corinthians 12:16) 
And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” it is not therefore not of the body?

(1 Corinthians 12:17) 
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?

(1 Corinthians 12:18) 
But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, as He willed.

(1 Corinthians 12:19) 
If all were one member, where would the body be?

(1 Corinthians 12:20) 
Now indeed there are many members, but one body.

(1 Corinthians 12:21) 
The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”

(1 Corinthians 12:22) 
Rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are more necessary.

(1 Corinthians 12:23) 
And those members of the body that we think to be less honorable, these we surround with greater honor; and those parts that are unpresentable, we have the greater honor.

(1 Corinthians 12:24) 
But the parts that are honorable have no need. But God has tempered the body together, giving greater honor to the one which lacked honor,

(1 Corinthians 12:25) 
so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.

(1 Corinthians 12:26) 
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.

(1 Corinthians 12:27) 
Now you are the body of Christ, and members of His body.

(1 Corinthians 12:28) 
And God has appointed in the Church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.

(1 Corinthians 12:29) 
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?

(1 Corinthians 12:30) 
Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?

(1 Corinthians 12:31) 
But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.

(1 Corinthians 13:1) 
If I speak in the tongues of men, or even of angels, but do not have love, then I have become like a noisy gong, or a clanging cymbal.

(1 Corinthians 13:2) 
And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, then I am nothing.

(1 Corinthians 13:3) 
And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.

(1 Corinthians 13:4) 
Love endures with patience, and is kind. Love does not envy, does not parade itself, is not puffed up,

(1 Corinthians 13:5) 
is not ambitious, does not seek its own, is not provoked to anger, and does not think evil,

(1 Corinthians 13:6) 
does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices with the truth.

(1 Corinthians 13:7) 
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

(1 Corinthians 13:8) 
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will be done away; whether there are tongues, they will cease; or whether there is knowledge, it will be destroyed.

(1 Corinthians 13:9) 
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

(1 Corinthians 13:10) 
But when that which is perfect comes, then that which is in part will be done away.

(1 Corinthians 13:11) 
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things.

(1 Corinthians 13:12) 
For now we see through a glass in a dark manner, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part; but then I will know as I also am known.

(1 Corinthians 13:13) 
And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.

(1 Corinthians 14:1) 
Pursue love. Be eager for the gifts of the Spirit, especially the gift of prophecy.

(1 Corinthians 14:2) 
Anyone who speaks in a language that no one understands is speaking to God, not to people. No one understands him. He is speaking mysteries in the Spirit.

(1 Corinthians 14:3) 
But the one who prophesies speaks to people, to build them up, encourage them, and comfort them.

(1 Corinthians 14:4) 
Anyone who speaks in a language that no one understands builds up himself. But the one who prophesies builds up the Church of God.

(1 Corinthians 14:5) 
I wish all of you spoke in languages, but even more that you prophesied. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in languages, unless he interprets, so that the Church may be built up.

(1 Corinthians 14:6) 
Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in languages, how will I help you unless I speak to you in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?

(1 Corinthians 14:7) 
Even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, must give a clear sound if they are to be understood. How will anyone know what is being played?

(1 Corinthians 14:8) 
If the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?

(1 Corinthians 14:9) 
So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will be speaking into the air.

(1 Corinthians 14:10) 
There are perhaps many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.

(1 Corinthians 14:11) 
If I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker a foreigner to me.

(1 Corinthians 14:12) 
So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, seek to abound in them for the building up of the Church.

(1 Corinthians 14:13) 
Therefore, anyone who speaks in a language should pray that he may interpret it.

(1 Corinthians 14:14) 
For if I pray in a language, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.

(1 Corinthians 14:15) 
So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.

(1 Corinthians 14:16) 
Otherwise, if you give thanks in the Spirit, how can the one who is present as an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?

(1 Corinthians 14:17) 
For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.

(1 Corinthians 14:18) 
I give thanks to God that I speak in languages more than all of you.

(1 Corinthians 14:19) 
But in the church, I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a language.

(1 Corinthians 14:20) 
Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your understanding. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.

(1 Corinthians 14:21) 
In the Law it is written: “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 14:22) 
So languages are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.

(1 Corinthians 14:23) 
So if the whole Church comes together and all speak in languages, and some unbelievers or uninstructed people come in, will they not say that you are mad?

(1 Corinthians 14:24) 
But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in, he is convicted by all and is judged by all.

(1 Corinthians 14:25) 
And so the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is really among you.

(1 Corinthians 14:26) 
What then, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.

(1 Corinthians 14:27) 
If anyone speaks in a language, let there be only two or at most three, and let them speak one at a time, and let someone interpret.

(1 Corinthians 14:28) 
But if there is no one to interpret, let the speaker keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.

(1 Corinthians 14:29) 
Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.

(1 Corinthians 14:30) 
If anything is revealed to another sitting nearby, let the first one be silent.

(1 Corinthians 14:31) 
For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.

(1 Corinthians 14:32) 
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

(1 Corinthians 14:33) 
For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

(1 Corinthians 14:34) 
let the women keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law says.

(1 Corinthians 14:35) 
If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.

(1 Corinthians 14:36) 
Did the word of God originate with you? Or has it come only to you?

(1 Corinthians 14:37) 
If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 14:38) 
If anyone does not recognize them, he will not be recognized.

(1 Corinthians 14:39) 
So, brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in languages.

(1 Corinthians 14:40) 
But all things should be done decently and in order.

(1 Corinthians 15:1) 
Brothers, I want you to know the Gospel that I preached to you, that you received, and in which you stand,

(1 Corinthians 15:2) 
by which you are saved, if you hold fast to the Gospel that I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.

(1 Corinthians 15:3) 
For I delivered to you first of all what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

(1 Corinthians 15:4) 
and that He was buried, and that He rose on the third day according to the Scriptures,

(1 Corinthians 15:5) 
and that He was seen by Cephas, and then by the eleven.

(1 Corinthians 15:6) 
After that, He was seen by more than five hundred brothers at once; most of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep.

(1 Corinthians 15:7) 
Then He was seen by James, and then by all the Apostles.

(1 Corinthians 15:8) 
And last of all, as to one untimely born, He was seen by me also.

(1 Corinthians 15:9) 
For I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

(1 Corinthians 15:10) 
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace in me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God with me.

(1 Corinthians 15:11) 
Whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

(1 Corinthians 15:12) 
Now if Christ is preached as having been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

(1 Corinthians 15:13) 
For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either.

(1 Corinthians 15:14) 
And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain.

(1 Corinthians 15:15) 
We are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if the dead do not rise.

(1 Corinthians 15:16) 
For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised either.

(1 Corinthians 15:17) 
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.

(1 Corinthians 15:18) 
Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

(1 Corinthians 15:19) 
If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.

(1 Corinthians 15:20) 
But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

(1 Corinthians 15:21) 
For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead.

(1 Corinthians 15:22) 
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.

(1 Corinthians 15:23) 
But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then those who are Christ's at His coming.

(1 Corinthians 15:24) 
Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed every rule and every authority and power.

(1 Corinthians 15:25) 
For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

(1 Corinthians 15:26) 
The last enemy to be destroyed is death.

(1 Corinthians 15:27) 
For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.

(1 Corinthians 15:28) 
When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who put all things in subjection to Him, so that God may be all in all.

(1 Corinthians 15:29) 
Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are people baptized for them?

(1 Corinthians 15:30) 
And why are we in danger every hour?

(1 Corinthians 15:31) 
I protest by your boasting, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die every day.

(1 Corinthians 15:32) 
If, after the manner of men, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead do not rise, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”

(1 Corinthians 15:33) 
Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

(1 Corinthians 15:34) 
Wake up to righteousness and do not sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.

(1 Corinthians 15:35) 
But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”

(1 Corinthians 15:36) 
Fool! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.

(1 Corinthians 15:37) 
And what you sow, you do not sow that body which shall be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.

(1 Corinthians 15:38) 
But God gives it a body as He has willed, and to each seed a body of its own.

(1 Corinthians 15:39) 
All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh for humans, another flesh for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.

(1 Corinthians 15:40) 
There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies, but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

(1 Corinthians 15:41) 
There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

(1 Corinthians 15:42) 
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.

(1 Corinthians 15:43) 
It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.

(1 Corinthians 15:44) 
It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.

(1 Corinthians 15:45) 
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

(1 Corinthians 15:46) 
So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.

(1 Corinthians 15:47) 
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.

(1 Corinthians 15:48) 
The first man was from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven.

(1 Corinthians 15:49) 
As was the earthly man, so are those who are earthly; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are heavenly.

(1 Corinthians 15:50) 
And just as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.

(1 Corinthians 15:51) 
Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.

(1 Corinthians 15:52) 
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,

(1 Corinthians 15:53) 
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.

(1 Corinthians 15:54) 
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

(1 Corinthians 15:55) 
But when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

(1 Corinthians 15:56) 
“O Death, where is your victory? O Hades, where is your sting?”

(1 Corinthians 15:57) 
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.

(1 Corinthians 15:58) 
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Corinthians 15:59) 
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 16:1) 
Now, regarding the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches in Galatia, so also you should do.

(1 Corinthians 16:2) 
On the first day of the week, let each of you put aside and store up whatever he may have been blessed with, so that there be no collections when I come.

(1 Corinthians 16:3) 
And when I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters, to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.

(1 Corinthians 16:4) 
If it is fitting that I go as well, they will go with me.

(1 Corinthians 16:5) 
I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia.

(1 Corinthians 16:6) 
Perhaps I will stay with you for a time, or even spend the winter with you, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.

(1 Corinthians 16:7) 
For I do not want to see you just in passing; I hope to remain with you for a while, if the Lord allows.

(1 Corinthians 16:8) 
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost.

(1 Corinthians 16:9) 
For a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many adversaries.

(1 Corinthians 16:10) 
If Timothy comes, see that he is without fear among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.

(1 Corinthians 16:11) 
Therefore, let no one despise him, but send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers.

(1 Corinthians 16:12) 
Now, concerning our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing to come now; but he will come when he has the opportunity.

(1 Corinthians 16:13) 
Be vigilant, stand firm in the faith, act like men, and be strong.

(1 Corinthians 16:14) 
Let all that you do be done in love.

(1 Corinthians 16:15) 
Now I urge you, brothers: you know that the household of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, are the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints.

(1 Corinthians 16:16) 
I ask that you be subject to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them.

(1 Corinthians 16:17) 
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.

(1 Corinthians 16:18) 
They have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, acknowledge such people.

(1 Corinthians 16:19) 
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, salute you warmly in the Lord.

(1 Corinthians 16:20) 
All the brothers salute you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

(1 Corinthians 16:21) 
The greeting is with my own hand—Paul’s.

(1 Corinthians 16:22) 
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Maran atha!

(1 Corinthians 16:23) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

(1 Corinthians 16:24) 
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.

(2 Corinthians 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, to the Church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all of Achaia:

(2 Corinthians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be granted to you by God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Corinthians 1:3) 
Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all consolation,

(2 Corinthians 1:4) 
who comforts us in all our tribulation, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

(2 Corinthians 1:5) 
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also our consolation abounds through Christ.

(2 Corinthians 1:6) 
Whether we are afflicted, it is for your exhortation and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your consolation, which produces the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer:

(2 Corinthians 1:7) 
so that our hope for you may be steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the consolation.

(2 Corinthians 1:8) 
For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about our affliction which came upon us in Asia, that we were crushed beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.

(2 Corinthians 1:9) 
But we ourselves had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God, who raises the dead;

(2 Corinthians 1:10) 
who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver, on whom we have set our hope that He will also deliver us again,

(2 Corinthians 1:11) 
while you also help us by prayer, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift bestowed on us through the prayers of many.

(2 Corinthians 1:12) 
For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in carnal wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.

(2 Corinthians 1:13) 
For we are not writing anything to you other than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand completely,

(2 Corinthians 1:14) 
as you have also understood us in part, that we are your glory, even as you are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.

(2 Corinthians 1:15) 
Because of this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,

(2 Corinthians 1:16) 
and to pass through you to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way toward Judea.

(2 Corinthians 1:17) 
When I had planned this, did I do so lightly? Or do I make plans according to the flesh, so that with me there is yes and no?

(2 Corinthians 1:18) 
But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.

(2 Corinthians 1:19) 
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in Him it was yes.

(2 Corinthians 1:20) 
For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.

(2 Corinthians 1:21) 
Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,

(2 Corinthians 1:22) 
who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.

(2 Corinthians 1:23) 
But I call on God as witness to my soul, that to spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.

(2 Corinthians 1:24) 
Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for in faith you stand firm.

(2 Corinthians 2:1) 
This is my own decision: I will not visit you with sadness again.

(2 Corinthians 2:2) 
Because if I cause you grief, who is there to make me joyful, except for the one who suffers grief from me?

(2 Corinthians 2:3) 
This is why I wrote to you, so that I will not have grief when I arrive, from those who should be my joy. I have confidence in all of you, because my joy is the joy of you all.

(2 Corinthians 2:4) 
For I wrote to you with great affliction and anguish of heart, through many tears: not to cause you grief, but so you know how much love I have for you.

(2 Corinthians 2:5) 
Now, if anyone has caused grief, it has not been me, but in part, so as not to burden all of you.

(2 Corinthians 2:6) 
It is enough for such a person to be rebuked, as he has been by most of you.

(2 Corinthians 2:7) 
Instead, you should forgive him and console him, lest he is overwhelmed by excessive grief.

(2 Corinthians 2:8) 
So, I ask you to reaffirm your love for him.

(2 Corinthians 2:9) 
I wrote to you for this very purpose: to see if you are obedient in all things.

(2 Corinthians 2:10) 
If you forgive anyone, I also forgive. Because whatever I have forgiven, I have forgiven it for you, in the person of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 2:11) 
So that we are not taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.

(2 Corinthians 2:12) 
When I went to Troas to preach the Gospel of Christ, and a door was opened for me in the Lord,

(2 Corinthians 2:13) 
I had no rest in my spirit because I didn't find my brother Titus. So I said goodbye to them and set off for Macedonia.

(2 Corinthians 2:14) 
But thanks be to God, who always gives us the victory in Christ, and manifests the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place.

(2 Corinthians 2:15) 
For we are the aroma of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:

(2 Corinthians 2:16) 
to some, it is the scent of death leading to death, and to others, the scent of life leading to life. And who is worthy of this?

(2 Corinthians 2:17) 
We are not like so many others who are corrupting the word of God. Instead, we speak with sincerity, from God, before God, in Christ.

(2 Corinthians 3:1) 
Are we now starting again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?

(2 Corinthians 3:2) 
You are our letter of recommendation, written in our hearts, which all men know and read:

(2 Corinthians 3:3) 
It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, prepared through our ministry, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on the tablets of the flesh of the heart.

(2 Corinthians 3:4) 
And such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God:

(2 Corinthians 3:5) 
Not that we are sufficient to think of anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God:

(2 Corinthians 3:6) 
Who also made us capable ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.

(2 Corinthians 3:7) 
Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stone, was in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look upon the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which glory was passing:

(2 Corinthians 3:8) 
How much more will the ministry of the Spirit be with glory?

(2 Corinthians 3:9) 
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more abounds in glory the ministry of justice.

(2 Corinthians 3:10) 
For indeed that which was made glorious has not been glorified in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.

(2 Corinthians 3:11) 
For if that which passes away was glorious, much more that which remains is in glory.

(2 Corinthians 3:12) 
Therefore, having such a hope, we use much confidence:

(2 Corinthians 3:13) 
And not as Moses put a veil over his face, so that the children of Israel could not look at the end of that which was passing.

(2 Corinthians 3:14) 
But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil in the reading of the Old Testament remains unremoved, because in Christ it is done away.

(2 Corinthians 3:15) 
But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is still placed upon their heart.

(2 Corinthians 3:16) 
But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.

(2 Corinthians 3:17) 
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

(2 Corinthians 3:18) 
But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 4:1) 
Therefore, since we have received this work of ministry, by God's mercy, we don't give up;

(2 Corinthians 4:2) 
but we avoid the hidden tricks of shame, we don't distort the Word of God, and we speak the truth in the open, recommending ourselves to every human conscience before God.

(2 Corinthians 4:3) 
If our Gospel is veiled, it is hidden from those who are perishing;

(2 Corinthians 4:4) 
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, lest the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ shine through, who is the image of God.

(2 Corinthians 4:5) 
For we don't preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ Our Lord: but we declare ourselves to be your servants for Jesus' sake.

(2 Corinthians 4:6) 
Because God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to enlighten the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

(2 Corinthians 4:7) 
But we have this treasure in clay vessels: so that the preeminence of the power may be of God, and not of us.

(2 Corinthians 4:8) 
In all things we suffer tribulation, but we are not distressed; we are in doubt, but we don't despair;

(2 Corinthians 4:9) 
we are persecuted, but we are not abandoned; we are cast down, but we don't perish:

(2 Corinthians 4:10) 
always carrying about in our body the mortification of Jesus: so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our bodies.

(2 Corinthians 4:11) 
For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake: so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.

(2 Corinthians 4:12) 
Therefore, death is at work in us, but life in you.

(2 Corinthians 4:13) 
But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: "I believed, therefore I spoke," we also believe, therefore we speak:

(2 Corinthians 4:14) 
knowing that He who raised up Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you.

(2 Corinthians 4:15) 
For all things are for you, so that the abundance of grace, by many thanksgivings, may abound to the glory of God.

(2 Corinthians 4:16) 
Therefore we don't give up: but even though our outer man is decaying, our inner man is renewed day by day.

(2 Corinthians 4:17) 
For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, works for us, above all measure, an eternal weight of glory:

(2 Corinthians 4:18) 
as we don't look at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.

(2 Corinthians 5:1) 
We know that when our earthly body dies, God has a building prepared for us. It's not made by human hands but eternal in heaven.

(2 Corinthians 5:2) 
We groan in our bodies, longing to be clothed in a heavenly dwelling.

(2 Corinthians 5:3) 
We hope that when we are clothed, we are not found naked of good works.

(2 Corinthians 5:4) 
Indeed, we groan under the weight of this tent we call our body. Not that we want to be unclothed but rather clothed in new life, so that what is mortal is swallowed up by life eternal.

(2 Corinthians 5:5) 
God, who prepared us for this, has given us the Holy Spirit as a pledge.

(2 Corinthians 5:6) 
So we are always confident, knowing that while we are in the body, we are away from the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 5:7) 
We walk by faith, not by sight.

(2 Corinthians 5:8) 
We are confident and prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 5:9) 
So we make it our aim to please Him, whether at home or away.

(2 Corinthians 5:10) 
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what he has done in the body, whether good or bad.

(2 Corinthians 5:11) 
Knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people, and God knows our hearts. I hope that you understand us too.

(2 Corinthians 5:12) 
We are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so you can answer those who boast about outward appearance and not their inner hearts.

(2 Corinthians 5:13) 
For whether we are out of our minds, it is for God; or whether we are sober, it is for you.

(2 Corinthians 5:14) 
The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all; therefore all have died.

(2 Corinthians 5:15) 
And He died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised.

(2 Corinthians 5:16) 
From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once knew Christ according to the flesh, we no longer know Him that way.

(2 Corinthians 5:17) 
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

(2 Corinthians 5:18) 
All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.

(2 Corinthians 5:19) 
God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.

(2 Corinthians 5:20) 
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

(2 Corinthians 5:21) 
For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

(2 Corinthians 6:1) 
We are working together, and we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.

(2 Corinthians 6:2) 
For He says, "In an acceptable time, I have heard you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you." Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.

(2 Corinthians 6:3) 
We give no offense to anyone, so that the ministry may not be blamed.

(2 Corinthians 6:4) 
But in everything, we are showing ourselves to be ministers of God: through much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses,

(2 Corinthians 6:5) 
in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings,

(2 Corinthians 6:6) 
in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,

(2 Corinthians 6:7) 
in the word of truth, in the power of God: through the weapons of justice on the right and on the left,

(2 Corinthians 6:8) 
through glory and dishonor, through ill repute and good repute. We are treated as deceivers, and yet we are truthful;

(2 Corinthians 6:9) 
as unknown, and yet we are well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed;

(2 Corinthians 6:10) 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.

(2 Corinthians 6:11) 
Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians; our heart is enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 6:12) 
You are not limited in us, but you are limited in your own affections.

(2 Corinthians 6:13) 
Now for the same recompense (I speak as to my children), be you also enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 6:14) 
Do not be yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?

(2 Corinthians 6:15) 
What harmony does Christ have with Belial? Or what does a believer share with an unbeliever?

(2 Corinthians 6:16) 
What agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: "I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."

(2 Corinthians 6:17) 
Therefore, "Come out from among them, and be separate," says the Lord, "and touch no unclean thing. And I will receive you,"

(2 Corinthians 6:18) 
"And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me," says the Lord Almighty.

(2 Corinthians 7:1) 
Since we have God's promises, beloved ones, let us purify ourselves from all sin, which stains the flesh and the soul. Let us finish the work of spiritual growth, which is born of reverent fear of God.

(2 Corinthians 7:2) 
Open up your hearts to us. We haven’t harmed anyone. We haven’t corrupted anyone. We haven’t taken advantage of anyone.

(2 Corinthians 7:3) 
I don’t mean to accuse anyone. I’ve already said that you have a place in our hearts, for us to live and die with.

(2 Corinthians 7:4) 
I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am overflowing with consolation, and I am filled with joy in the midst of all our suffering.

(2 Corinthians 7:5) 
Because when we came to Macedonia, we got no rest. We were attacked on all sides. There was conflict all around us, and anxiety within.

(2 Corinthians 7:6) 
But God, who comforts the afflicted, comforted us when Titus arrived.

(2 Corinthians 7:7) 
His arrival wasn’t the only comfort, but we were consoled by the comfort he received from you. He told us about your longing to see us, your grief, and your zeal for me, so that I was even more joyful.

(2 Corinthians 7:8) 
Even though I saddened you in the letter, I don’t regret it. I do regret it, because that letter, although it was painful for a time, did sadden you.

(2 Corinthians 7:9) 
Now I am joyful, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened to the point of repentance. Because you were saddened in the right way, according to God's will, so that you suffered no loss from us.

(2 Corinthians 7:10) 
For grief that is according to God brings repentance that leads to salvation, which will never be regretted. But the grief of the world brings death.

(2 Corinthians 7:11) 
See what this very thing—that you were saddened in the right way, according to God's will—has produced in you: great diligence, a defense of your character, indignation against sin, fear of God, longing to be reconciled, zeal for doing good, and a readiness to punish the offender. You have shown yourselves to be blameless in the matter.

(2 Corinthians 7:12) 
So, even though I wrote the letter, it wasn’t for the sake of the one who did wrong or the one who was wronged. I wrote so that you might understand the great care we have for you, as shown in the sight of God.

(2 Corinthians 7:13) 
This is why we were comforted. And in our comfort, we rejoiced even more because of Titus’s joy, for his spirit was refreshed by you all.

(2 Corinthians 7:14) 
For if I had boasted to him about you, I was not ashamed, but just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting about you to Titus has also proven to be true.

(2 Corinthians 7:15) 
And his heart is overflowing with affection for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.

(2 Corinthians 7:16) 
I am rejoicing that I have complete confidence in you in every way.

(2 Corinthians 8:1) 
We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God given to the churches in Macedonia:

(2 Corinthians 8:2) 
During their great suffering, the overflowing joy and their extreme poverty were able to abound in the riches of their generosity.

(2 Corinthians 8:3) 
For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond their ability; they were willing, even beyond their means,

(2 Corinthians 8:4) 
begging us with great insistence for the grace of participating in the service to the saints.

(2 Corinthians 8:5) 
And this was more than we expected, because they gave themselves first to God and then to us, by the will of God.

(2 Corinthians 8:6) 
So we urged Titus to finish what he had started. He was the one who started the grace of giving.

(2 Corinthians 8:7) 
But since you abound in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us, may you also abound in this grace.

(2 Corinthians 8:8) 
I am not commanding you, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the diligence of others.

(2 Corinthians 8:9) 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; though He was rich, for your sake He became poor, so that through His poverty you might become rich.

(2 Corinthians 8:10) 
And I give my judgment in this matter: it is to your advantage to finish what you began a year ago, and to do so with enthusiasm.

(2 Corinthians 8:11) 
Now, finish doing it, so that your readiness to give may be matched by your eagerness to give out of what you have.

(2 Corinthians 8:12) 
If the willingness is there, the offering is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.

(2 Corinthians 8:13) 
For I do not want you to be burdened while others are relieved, but that there should be equality.

(2 Corinthians 8:14) 
At the present time, your abundance should supply their need, so that their abundance may also supply your need; then there will be equality.

(2 Corinthians 8:15) 
As it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”

(2 Corinthians 8:16) 
But thanks be to God, who put the same diligence for you into the heart of Titus.

(2 Corinthians 8:17) 
For he accepted the exhortation, but he is even more diligent and comes to you of his own accord.

(2 Corinthians 8:18) 
We are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in the Gospel.

(2 Corinthians 8:19) 
Moreover, he was appointed by the churches to travel with us as we administer this grace for the glory of the Lord and to show our eagerness to help.

(2 Corinthians 8:20) 
We are careful to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this generous offering.

(2 Corinthians 8:21) 
We are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of others.

(2 Corinthians 8:22) 
We are sending along with them our brother, whom we have often tested in many matters and found eager, but who is now even more eager because of his great trust in you.

(2 Corinthians 8:23) 
As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. As for our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 8:24) 
Therefore, show these men the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you, before the face of the churches.

(2 Corinthians 9:1) 
Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it's unnecessary for me to write to you about it.

(2 Corinthians 9:2) 
For I know your willing spirit, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your enthusiasm has stirred up many others.

(2 Corinthians 9:3) 
I sent the brothers so that our boasting about you might not be in vain in this regard, but that, as I said, you might be prepared.

(2 Corinthians 9:4) 
Otherwise, when I come with the Macedonians and find you unprepared, we (not to say you) would be ashamed in this matter.

(2 Corinthians 9:5) 
Therefore, I considered it necessary to ask the brothers to go ahead of you to you, and prepare this promised blessing, so that it may be ready as a blessing and not as a matter of greed.

(2 Corinthians 9:6) 
I say this: The one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and the one who sows generously will also reap generously.

(2 Corinthians 9:7) 
Each one must give as they have determined in their heart, not reluctantly or out of compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

(2 Corinthians 9:8) 
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you may abound in every good work.

(2 Corinthians 9:9) 
As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever."

(2 Corinthians 9:10) 
Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.

(2 Corinthians 9:11) 
You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.

(2 Corinthians 9:12) 
For this service of ministering to the needs of the saints is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also abounding with many thanksgivings to God.

(2 Corinthians 9:13) 
Through the proof of this service, they will glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the Gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone.

(2 Corinthians 9:14) 
And in their prayers for you, they long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.

(2 Corinthians 9:15) 
Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift!

(2 Corinthians 10:1) 
And I, Paul, now implore you by the gentleness and humility of Christ. Some people say I seem weak when I am with you in person, but in my absence, I am a stern teacher.

(2 Corinthians 10:2) 
I beg you not to force me to be bold in my teaching. Some say I walk in worldly ways.

(2 Corinthians 10:3) 
Even though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.

(2 Corinthians 10:4) 
The weapons we fight with are not those of this world, but they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments,

(2 Corinthians 10:5) 
and every pretension that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 10:6) 
And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience when your obedience is complete.

(2 Corinthians 10:7) 
You are judging by mere appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.

(2 Corinthians 10:8) 
Even if I boast somewhat more about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.

(2 Corinthians 10:9) 
I do not want you to think I am trying to frighten you with my letters.

(2 Corinthians 10:10) 
Some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person, he is weak, and his speech is of no account.”

(2 Corinthians 10:11) 
Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.

(2 Corinthians 10:12) 
We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.

(2 Corinthians 10:13) 
We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but will keep within the limits of the sphere God has assigned to us, a sphere that reaches even to you.

(2 Corinthians 10:14) 
We are not going too far in our boasting, since we were the first to come to you with the gospel of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 10:15) 
We do not boast beyond measure of other people’s labor, but we hope that as your faith increases, our sphere of activity among you will be enlarged.

(2 Corinthians 10:16) 
We want to preach the gospel to you even more, and go to places beyond you, without boasting in what has already been done in someone else's sphere.

(2 Corinthians 10:17) 
Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 10:18) 
For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.

(2 Corinthians 11:1) 
I wish you would put up with just a little bit of my foolishness! But please bear with me.

(2 Corinthians 11:2) 
I am zealous for you with the zeal of God. I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:3) 
But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts may be corrupted and led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:4) 
For if anyone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it very well.

(2 Corinthians 11:5) 
For I consider that I am in no way inferior to these super-apostles.

(2 Corinthians 11:6) 
Even if I am unskilled in speech, I am not unskilled in knowledge. But in every way we have been fully manifested among you.

(2 Corinthians 11:7) 
Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the Gospel of God to you free of charge?

(2 Corinthians 11:8) 
I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to serve you.

(2 Corinthians 11:9) 
And when I was present with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone. The brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked, and in everything I have kept myself, and will keep myself, from being a burden to you.

(2 Corinthians 11:10) 
As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.

(2 Corinthians 11:11) 
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!

(2 Corinthians 11:12) 
But what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity of those who want an opportunity to be regarded as we are in what they boast about.

(2 Corinthians 11:13) 
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.

(2 Corinthians 11:14) 
And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.

(2 Corinthians 11:15) 
So it is no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.

(2 Corinthians 11:16) 
I say again: Let no one think me foolish. But if you do, then receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.

(2 Corinthians 11:17) 
What I am saying, I am not saying as the Lord would, but as it were, in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.

(2 Corinthians 11:18) 
Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.

(2 Corinthians 11:19) 
For you gladly put up with fools, being as you are so wise!

(2 Corinthians 11:20) 
For you put up with it if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes advantage of you, if anyone exalts himself, if anyone strikes you in the face.

(2 Corinthians 11:21) 
I say this to my shame, as though we were weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast (I am speaking in foolishness), I also dare to boast.

(2 Corinthians 11:22) 
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.

(2 Corinthians 11:23) 
Are they servants of Christ? (I am speaking as a fool.) I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death.

(2 Corinthians 11:24) 
Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.

(2 Corinthians 11:25) 
Three times I was beaten with rods, I was stoned once, three times I was shipwrecked, and I have spent a night and a day in the open sea.

(2 Corinthians 11:26) 
In journeys often, dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers.

(2 Corinthians 11:27) 
In labor and hardship, through sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often in fasting, in cold and nakedness.

(2 Corinthians 11:28) 
And besides other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.

(2 Corinthians 11:29) 
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with anger?

(2 Corinthians 11:30) 
If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

(2 Corinthians 11:31) 
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.

(2 Corinthians 11:32) 
In Damascus the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to arrest me.

(2 Corinthians 11:33) 
But I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.

(2 Corinthians 12:1) 
It is necessary for me to boast, though I shouldn't. But I will now speak about the visions and revelations of the Lord.

(2 Corinthians 12:2) 
I know a man in Christ, who was taken up fourteen years ago to the third atmosphere—I do not know whether in the body, or out of the body, God knows.

(2 Corinthians 12:3) 
And I know that this man, whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows,

(2 Corinthians 12:4) 
was snatched up into Paradise. He heard things that cannot be spoken, that no man is allowed to utter.

(2 Corinthians 12:5) 
I will boast about this man. I will not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses.

(2 Corinthians 12:6) 
For even if I wanted to boast, I would not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees in me, or that he hears of me.

(2 Corinthians 12:7) 
And lest the magnitude of the revelations should lift me up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.

(2 Corinthians 12:8) 
Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.

(2 Corinthians 12:9) 
And He said to me: “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.

(2 Corinthians 12:10) 
Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

(2 Corinthians 12:11) 
I have become foolish, you have compelled me. For I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was no way inferior to the most eminent apostles, although I am nothing.

(2 Corinthians 12:12) 
For the signs of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

(2 Corinthians 12:13) 
For what is there that you were inferior to other churches? Except that I myself have not been a burden to you. Forgive me this injury.

(2 Corinthians 12:14) 
Behold, I am ready to come to you the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. For I seek not yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

(2 Corinthians 12:15) 
But I most gladly will spend and be spent for your souls. Though loving you more, I am loved less.

(2 Corinthians 12:16) 
But be it so: I did not burden you: but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.

(2 Corinthians 12:17) 
Did I then make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?

(2 Corinthians 12:18) 
I desired Titus, and I sent a brother with him: did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?

(2 Corinthians 12:19) 
Do you think that all along we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ: but all things, dearly beloved, for your edification.

(2 Corinthians 12:20) 
For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, jealousies, angers, quarrels, detractions, whisperings, swellings of pride, seditions:

(2 Corinthians 12:21) 
Lest, when I come again, God humiliate me among you: and I mourn many of those who before have sinned and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed.

(2 Corinthians 13:1) 
This is the third time I am coming to you. Every matter must be confirmed by the word of two or three witnesses.

(2 Corinthians 13:2) 
I have said this before to those present, and I will say it again to those who are not here, that if I come again, I will not spare you,

(2 Corinthians 13:3) 
because you seek proof that Christ is speaking through me. Christ is not weak in you, but rather, He is strong in you.

(2 Corinthians 13:4) 
For even though He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God within you.

(2 Corinthians 13:5) 
Test yourselves to see if you are living in the faith. Examine yourselves. Or do you not know this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobate?

(2 Corinthians 13:6) 
But I trust that you will recognize that we are not reprobate.

(2 Corinthians 13:7) 
And we pray to God that you may do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but rather, that you should do what is good, even if we are considered reprobate.

(2 Corinthians 13:8) 
For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.

(2 Corinthians 13:9) 
For we rejoice when we are weak: we pray for your perfection.

(2 Corinthians 13:10) 
Therefore, I write these things while absent, so that when I am present, I do not have to act severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for destroying.

(2 Corinthians 13:11) 
Finally, brothers, rejoice, be perfect, be comforted, be of one mind, have peace, and the God of peace and love will be with you.

(2 Corinthians 13:12) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss.

(2 Corinthians 13:13) 
All the saints greet you.

(2 Corinthians 13:14) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.

(Galatians 1:1) 
Paul, a sent one (not appointed by humans, nor through a human intermediary, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),

(Galatians 1:2) 
and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.

(Galatians 1:3) 
May grace and peace be given to you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,

(Galatians 1:4) 
who gave Himself to atone for our sins so that we might be rescued from this present evil world, according to the will of God our Father,

(Galatians 1:5) 
to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

(Galatians 1:6) 
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you to experience the grace of Christ, in order to follow a different gospel;

(Galatians 1:7) 
which is not really a gospel at all; some people are troubling you, and want to change the gospel of Christ.

(Galatians 1:8) 
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to evangelize to you anything other than what we evangelized to you, may he be cursed.

(Galatians 1:9) 
As we have said before, so I now say again: If anyone evangelizes to you anything beyond what you have already received, may he be cursed.

(Galatians 1:10) 
Am I now trying to win the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.

(Galatians 1:11) 
For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was evangelized by me is not a human invention.

(Galatians 1:12) 
I did not receive it from any human, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

(Galatians 1:13) 
For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism: how I persecuted the Church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.

(Galatians 1:14) 
And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.

(Galatians 1:15) 
But when it pleased Him Who set me apart from birth, and called me through His grace,

(Galatians 1:16) 
to reveal His Son in me, so that I might evangelize Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,

(Galatians 1:17) 
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; rather, I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.

(Galatians 1:18) 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him for fifteen days.

(Galatians 1:19) 
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.

(Galatians 1:20) 
In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie.

(Galatians 1:21) 
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

(Galatians 1:22) 
And I was still unknown in face to the churches of Judea that were in Christ:

(Galatians 1:23) 
they only heard: “The one who formerly persecuted us is now evangelizing the faith that he once tried to destroy.”

(Galatians 1:24) 
And they were glorifying God in me.

(Galatians 2:1) 
Then after fourteen years, I returned to Jerusalem with Barnabas, bringing along Titus as well.

(Galatians 2:2) 
I went up because of a revelation. I presented the Gospel that I preach to the Gentiles, but I did so privately to those who seemed to be important leaders, to be certain that I wasn't running in vain.

(Galatians 2:3) 
But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.

(Galatians 2:4) 
This was because of certain false brothers who were secretly brought in. They were trying to find out about the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, to put us back into slavery.

(Galatians 2:5) 
We did not yield to these men for a single hour, nor did we give in to them. We did this so the truth of the Gospel would remain with you.

(Galatians 2:6) 
And from those who seemed to be something, it makes no difference to me what they once were—God shows no partiality. These so-called leaders added nothing to my Gospel.

(Galatians 2:7) 
On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the Gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the Gospel for the circumcised.

(Galatians 2:8) 
(For the one who worked through Peter in his ministry to the circumcised also worked through me among the Gentiles:)

(Galatians 2:9) 
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.

(Galatians 2:10) 
All they asked was that we should remember the poor, which is what I was very eager to do.

(Galatians 2:11) 
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.

(Galatians 2:12) 
Before certain men came from James, Peter used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself, because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.

(Galatians 2:13) 
The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.

(Galatians 2:14) 
When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas in front of everyone, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews?

(Galatians 2:15) 
We are Jews by birth, and not sinners from among the Gentiles;

(Galatians 2:16) 
yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.

(Galatians 2:17) 
But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, then does that mean Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!

(Galatians 2:18) 
For if I rebuild what I have destroyed, I become a transgressor.

(Galatians 2:19) 
For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ.

(Galatians 2:20) 
It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

(Galatians 2:21) 
I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!

(Galatians 3:1) 
O you foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was presented, crucified among you?

(Galatians 3:2) 
This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?

(Galatians 3:3) 
Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?

(Galatians 3:4) 
Have you suffered so many things in vain? If it is indeed in vain.

(Galatians 3:5) 
He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?

(Galatians 3:6) 
As Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

(Galatians 3:7) 
Know therefore that those who are of faith, are the sons of Abraham.

(Galatians 3:8) 
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, announced to Abraham: “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”

(Galatians 3:9) 
Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

(Galatians 3:10) 
For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.”

(Galatians 3:11) 
But that by the Law no one is justified with God is clear, for “the just man lives by faith.”

(Galatians 3:12) 
But the Law is not of faith, but “he who does them shall live in them.”

(Galatians 3:13) 
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having been made a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”

(Galatians 3:14) 
so that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

(Galatians 3:15) 
Brothers, I speak in human terms: even though it is only a man’s covenant, when it has been ratified, no one annuls it or adds to it.

(Galatians 3:16) 
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as referring to many, but as to one, “And to your seed,” who is Christ.

(Galatians 3:17) 
Now I say this: The Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise invalid.

(Galatians 3:18) 
For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no longer of promise; but God granted it to Abraham through promise.

(Galatians 3:19) 
Why then the Law? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom the promise was made, having been ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.

(Galatians 3:20) 
Now a mediator is not for one only, but God is one.

(Galatians 3:21) 
Is the Law then against the promises of God? By no means! For if a law had been given which could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the Law.

(Galatians 3:22) 
But the Scripture has confined all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

(Galatians 3:23) 
But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, confined until the faith which was to be revealed would come.

(Galatians 3:24) 
Therefore the Law was our tutor in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

(Galatians 3:25) 
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.

(Galatians 3:26) 
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 3:27) 
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.

(Galatians 3:28) 
There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor free; there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 3:29) 
And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

(Galatians 4:1) 
I mean, as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a servant, even though he owns everything,

(Galatians 4:2) 
but he is under guardians and managers until the time fixed by his father.

(Galatians 4:3) 
So too, when we were children, we were enslaved to the basic principles of this world.

(Galatians 4:4) 
But when the time had fully come, God sent forth the Son on a mission by God, born of a woman, born under the Law,

(Galatians 4:5) 
to redeem those who were under the Law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.

(Galatians 4:6) 
And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son on a mission by God into our hearts, crying out, “Abba! Father!”

(Galatians 4:7) 
So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.

(Galatians 4:8) 
However, formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods.

(Galatians 4:9) 
But now that you have known God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them again?

(Galatians 4:10) 
You observe days and months and seasons and years.

(Galatians 4:11) 
I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.

(Galatians 4:12) 
Become like me, because I also became like you, brothers. I beg you: you have done me no wrong.

(Galatians 4:13) 
You know that because of a physical illness I preached the gospel to you at first.

(Galatians 4:14) 
And though my condition was a trial for you, you did not despise or reject me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.

(Galatians 4:15) 
What has become of your blessedness? For I testify that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.

(Galatians 4:16) 
So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?

(Galatians 4:17) 
They make much of you, but not in a good way; they want to shut you out, so that you will make much of them.

(Galatians 4:18) 
It is always good to be made much of, in a good way, and not only when I am present with you,

(Galatians 4:19) 
My children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!

(Galatians 4:20) 
I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.

(Galatians 4:21) 
Tell me, you who want to be under the Law, do you not listen to the Law?

(Galatians 4:22) 
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.

(Galatians 4:23) 
But the son of the slave woman was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.

(Galatians 4:24) 
This is an allegory: for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.

(Galatians 4:25) 
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.

(Galatians 4:26) 
But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.

(Galatians 4:27) 
For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor; for the children of the desolate one are more than those of the one who has a husband.”

(Galatians 4:28) 
Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.

(Galatians 4:29) 
But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also now.

(Galatians 4:30) 
But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”

(Galatians 4:31) 
So, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.

(Galatians 5:1) 
Be free, therefore! Christ freed us. Do not be enslaved again.

(Galatians 5:2) 
I, Paul, say this: if you are circumcised, Christ will not benefit you in any way.

(Galatians 5:3) 
I testify again to any man who is circumcised that he is obligated to keep the whole Law.

(Galatians 5:4) 
You have been severed from Christ, all of you who try to become justified by the Law; you have fallen from grace.

(Galatians 5:5) 
We eagerly await through the Spirit, by faith, the hope of righteousness.

(Galatians 5:6) 
For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.

(Galatians 5:7) 
You were running well. Who stopped you from obeying the truth?

(Galatians 5:8) 
This kind of persuasion does not come from the One who called you.

(Galatians 5:9) 
A little bit of yeast leavens the whole lump.

(Galatians 5:10) 
I am confident in you in the Lord that you will think in no other way; but the one who is troubling you will pay the penalty, whoever he may be.

(Galatians 5:11) 
As for me, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.

(Galatians 5:12) 
I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!

(Galatians 5:13) 
For you were called to freedom, brothers. But do not use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another through love.

(Galatians 5:14) 
For the whole Law is fulfilled in one statement: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

(Galatians 5:15) 
But if you bite and devour one another, see that you are not consumed by one another.

(Galatians 5:16) 
But I say: walk in the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.

(Galatians 5:17) 
For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want.

(Galatians 5:18) 
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.

(Galatians 5:19) 
Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,

(Galatians 5:20) 
idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,

(Galatians 5:21) 
envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

(Galatians 5:22) 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control;

(Galatians 5:23) 
against such things there is no law.

(Galatians 5:24) 
Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

(Galatians 5:25) 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

(Galatians 5:26) 
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

(Galatians 6:1) 
Brothers, if a man is caught in some sin, you who are spiritual should correct him with the spirit of gentleness, being mindful of yourself, lest you also be tempted.

(Galatians 6:2) 
Carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

(Galatians 6:3) 
For if anyone thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

(Galatians 6:4) 
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have his boasting in himself alone, and not in another.

(Galatians 6:5) 
For each one will bear his own burden.

(Galatians 6:6) 
Let the one who is taught in the word share all good things with the one who teaches.

(Galatians 6:7) 
Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.

(Galatians 6:8) 
For he who sows to his flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

(Galatians 6:9) 
And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we do not give up.

(Galatians 6:10) 
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, but especially to those who are of the household of faith.

(Galatians 6:11) 
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.

(Galatians 6:12) 
Those who want to make a good show in the flesh are the ones who try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

(Galatians 6:13) 
For even those who are circumcised do not keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.

(Galatians 6:14) 
But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

(Galatians 6:15) 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but a new creation.

(Galatians 6:16) 
And as for all who will follow this rule, may peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.

(Galatians 6:17) 
From now on, let no one bother me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.

(Galatians 6:18) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.

(Ephesians 1:1) 
Paul, a commissioned apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the holy ones who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.

(Ephesians 1:2) 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Ephesians 1:3) 
Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the universe, in Christ,

(Ephesians 1:4) 
even as He chose us in Him before the beginning of the universe, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love,

(Ephesians 1:5) 
who predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the purpose of His will,

(Ephesians 1:6) 
to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He has graced us in His beloved Son.

(Ephesians 1:7) 
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins according to the riches of His grace,

(Ephesians 1:8) 
which He poured out on us in all wisdom and prudence,

(Ephesians 1:9) 
making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him,

(Ephesians 1:10) 
to be carried out in the fullness of time: that He would bring all things together in Christ, those in the universe and those on the earth—in Him;

(Ephesians 1:11) 
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,

(Ephesians 1:12) 
so that we who first hoped in Christ might be to the praise of His glory.

(Ephesians 1:13) 
In Him, you also, after listening to the word of truth, the Gospel of your salvation—in Him, after you also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

(Ephesians 1:14) 
who is the pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.

(Ephesians 1:15) 
For this reason I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love for all the saints,

(Ephesians 1:16) 
do not cease to give thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers,

(Ephesians 1:17) 
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him,

(Ephesians 1:18) 
the eyes of your heart being enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,

(Ephesians 1:19) 
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, in accordance with the working of the strength of His might,

(Ephesians 1:20) 
which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the universe,

(Ephesians 1:21) 
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

(Ephesians 1:22) 
And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the Church,

(Ephesians 1:23) 
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

(Ephesians 2:1) 
When you were dead, because of your sins and failings,

(Ephesians 2:2) 
you lived according to the ways of the world. You followed the devil, the prince of the power of the air, the evil spirit who now works in those who do not believe,

(Ephesians 2:3) 
Like them, we all once lived in the desires of our flesh, doing what our flesh and minds wanted. We were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else.

(Ephesians 2:4) 
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us,

(Ephesians 2:5) 
made us alive with Christ, even when we were dead in sins. God saved you by his grace.

(Ephesians 2:6) 
And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavens,

(Ephesians 2:7) 
to show in the ages to come the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

(Ephesians 2:8) 
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,

(Ephesians 2:9) 
not because of works, lest anyone should boast.

(Ephesians 2:10) 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

(Ephesians 2:11) 
Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is done in the flesh by hands,

(Ephesians 2:12) 
were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

(Ephesians 2:13) 
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

(Ephesians 2:14) 
For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility

(Ephesians 2:15) 
by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace,

(Ephesians 2:16) 
and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.

(Ephesians 2:17) 
And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.

(Ephesians 2:18) 
For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.

(Ephesians 2:19) 
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,

(Ephesians 2:20) 
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,

(Ephesians 2:21) 
in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.

(Ephesians 2:22) 
In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

(Ephesians 3:1) 
For this cause, I, Paul, the one imprisoned for the sake of Jesus Christ for the sake of you who are not Jews—

(Ephesians 3:2) 
Assuming you’ve heard about the special plan of God’s grace, which was given to me for your sake:

(Ephesians 3:3) 
That by a direct revelation, I have come to understand the mystery of the Church—just as I have written briefly above—

(Ephesians 3:4) 
By reading this, you will see my insight into the mystery of Christ.

(Ephesians 3:5) 
This mystery was not made known to those who lived in past generations, but now it has been revealed to the holy apostles and prophets, through the Holy Spirit:

(Ephesians 3:6) 
That the non-Jews are co-heirs and members of the same body, who share in the promises in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel:

(Ephesians 3:7) 
Of this Gospel, I have become a servant, through the gift of God’s grace, which was given to me through the working of His power.

(Ephesians 3:8) 
This grace was given to me, who is the least of all the saints: that I should announce the good news of Christ’s riches to all the non-Jewish nations.

(Ephesians 3:9) 
And to give understanding of what is the plan of this mystery, which was hidden for all time in God, who created all things.

(Ephesians 3:10) 
The purpose of this is that, now, the principalities and powers in the universe may come to know the many forms of God’s wisdom, through the Church.

(Ephesians 3:11) 
This plan was according to the eternal intention, which He made in Christ Jesus Our Lord:

(Ephesians 3:12) 
In Him we have confidence, and through faith in Him, we are free to approach God.

(Ephesians 3:13) 
So I ask that you do not be discouraged by my sufferings for your sake, which is your glory.

(Ephesians 3:14) 
Because of this, I bow my knees before the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ,

(Ephesians 3:15) 
From whom all family in the universe, and on the earth, are named.

(Ephesians 3:16) 
May He grant that you, according to the riches of His glory, be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner self,

(Ephesians 3:17) 
That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; may you be rooted and grounded in love,

(Ephesians 3:18) 
So that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth—

(Ephesians 3:19) 
To know also the surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

(Ephesians 3:20) 
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,

(Ephesians 3:21) 
To Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

(Ephesians 4:1) 
So I, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

(Ephesians 4:2) 
Be humble and gentle, be patient, bearing with one another in love,

(Ephesians 4:3) 
make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

(Ephesians 4:4) 
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called,

(Ephesians 4:5) 
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

(Ephesians 4:6) 
one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.

(Ephesians 4:7) 
But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.

(Ephesians 4:8) 
This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to mankind.”

(Ephesians 4:9) 
(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?

(Ephesians 4:10) 
He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)

(Ephesians 4:11) 
So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,

(Ephesians 4:12) 
to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up

(Ephesians 4:13) 
until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.

(Ephesians 4:14) 
Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.

(Ephesians 4:15) 
Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.

(Ephesians 4:16) 
From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

(Ephesians 4:17) 
So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.

(Ephesians 4:18) 
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

(Ephesians 4:19) 
Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.

(Ephesians 4:20) 
That, however, is not the way of life you learned

(Ephesians 4:21) 
when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.

(Ephesians 4:22) 
You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;

(Ephesians 4:23) 
to be made new in the attitude of your minds;

(Ephesians 4:24) 
and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

(Ephesians 4:25) 
Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.

(Ephesians 4:26) 
“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,

(Ephesians 4:27) 
and do not give the devil a foothold.

(Ephesians 4:28) 
Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.

(Ephesians 4:29) 
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

(Ephesians 4:30) 
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

(Ephesians 4:31) 
Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

(Ephesians 4:32) 
Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

(Ephesians 5:1) 
So, become imitators of God, as beloved children.

(Ephesians 5:2) 
And walk in love, just as Christ loved us, and offered Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a pleasing fragrance.

(Ephesians 5:3) 
But fornication and every impurity or greed, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints.

(Ephesians 5:4) 
Or indecency, or foolish talk, or obscenity, which are not becoming, but rather thanksgiving.

(Ephesians 5:5) 
For know and understand this: that every fornicator or impure person or the greedy, who is a servant of idols, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

(Ephesians 5:6) 
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.

(Ephesians 5:7) 
Therefore, do not be partakers with them.

(Ephesians 5:8) 
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light.

(Ephesians 5:9) 
(for the fruit of light is in all goodness and justice and truth),

(Ephesians 5:10) 
proving what is pleasing to God.

(Ephesians 5:11) 
And do not share in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

(Ephesians 5:12) 
For the things done by them in secret, it is shameful even to speak of.

(Ephesians 5:13) 
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.

(Ephesians 5:14) 
For everything that is made manifest is light.

(Ephesians 5:15) 
Therefore, it says: "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you."

(Ephesians 5:16) 
See, therefore, brothers, how carefully you walk: not as unwise,

(Ephesians 5:17) 
but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

(Ephesians 5:18) 
Therefore, do not become foolish, but understanding what the will of God is.

(Ephesians 5:19) 
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is debauchery, but be filled with the Holy Spirit,

(Ephesians 5:20) 
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord,

(Ephesians 5:21) 
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father:

(Ephesians 5:22) 
Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.

(Ephesians 5:23) 
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.

(Ephesians 5:24) 
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church: He is the Savior of His body.

(Ephesians 5:25) 
But as the Church is subject to Christ, so also let wives be to their husbands in all things.

(Ephesians 5:26) 
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself up for her,

(Ephesians 5:27) 
that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word of life,

(Ephesians 5:28) 
that He might present her to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.

(Ephesians 5:29) 
So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

(Ephesians 5:30) 
For no one ever hated his own flesh: but nourishes and cherishes it, as also Christ does the Church:

(Ephesians 5:31) 
because we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.

(Ephesians 5:32) 
“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”

(Ephesians 5:33) 
This is a great mystery, and I mean in Christ and in the Church.

(Ephesians 6:1) 
Children, obey your parents in the Lord; this is right.

(Ephesians 6:2) 
“Honor your father and your mother.” This is the first commandment with a promise:

(Ephesians 6:3) 
“that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”

(Ephesians 6:4) 
And, you fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.

(Ephesians 6:5) 
Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:

(Ephesians 6:6) 
Not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,

(Ephesians 6:7) 
Serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men:

(Ephesians 6:8) 
Knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive from the Lord, whether slave or free.

(Ephesians 6:9) 
And, you masters, do the same things to them, remitting threats, knowing that both theirs and yours is the Lord in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.

(Ephesians 6:10) 
For the rest, be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of His might.

(Ephesians 6:11) 
Put on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.

(Ephesians 6:12) 
For we are not wrestling against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual wickedness in the high places.

(Ephesians 6:13) 
Therefore, take up the armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day and, being perfect in all things, to stand.

(Ephesians 6:14) 
Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having put on the breastplate of justice,

(Ephesians 6:15) 
And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:

(Ephesians 6:16) 
In all things, taking up the shield of faith, with which you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one.

(Ephesians 6:17) 
And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).

(Ephesians 6:18) 
By every prayer and supplication, praying at all times in the spirit, and in this watching with all insistence and supplication for all the saints:

(Ephesians 6:19) 
And for me, that speech may be given to me, in the opening of my mouth, with confidence to make known the mystery of the gospel:

(Ephesians 6:20) 
For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that I may dare to speak it, as I ought to speak.

(Ephesians 6:21) 
But that you also may know the things concerning me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, the most beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you:

(Ephesians 6:22) 
Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.

(Ephesians 6:23) 
Peace to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Ephesians 6:24) 
Grace with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.

(Philippians 1:1) 
Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, send greetings to all the holy ones in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, including their overseers and those who serve them.

(Philippians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be granted to you by God our Father and by the Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:3) 
I thank my God whenever I think of you,

(Philippians 1:4) 
always in my every prayer, I pray with joy for all of you,

(Philippians 1:5) 
because you have shared the Gospel from the very first day until now:

(Philippians 1:6) 
I am sure of this: God, who has begun this good work in you, will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:7) 
It is right that I should feel this way about all of you, because I hold you in my heart. You share in God’s grace with me, and you are with me in my imprisonment, and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel.

(Philippians 1:8) 
God is my witness that I long for all of you with the deep love of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 1:9) 
And I pray that your love may overflow more and more, with knowledge and with all insight,

(Philippians 1:10) 
so that you may discern what is best, and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

(Philippians 1:11) 
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

(Philippians 1:12) 
Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the Gospel,

(Philippians 1:13) 
so that my imprisonment for Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else.

(Philippians 1:14) 
And because of my imprisonment, most of the brothers and sisters have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.

(Philippians 1:15) 
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

(Philippians 1:16) 
The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the Gospel.

(Philippians 1:17) 
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to my distress in my chains.

(Philippians 1:18) 
So what? The important thing is that in every way, whether from wrong motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,

(Philippians 1:19) 
for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.

(Philippians 1:20) 
I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

(Philippians 1:21) 
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

(Philippians 1:22) 
If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!

(Philippians 1:23) 
I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;

(Philippians 1:24) 
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.

(Philippians 1:25) 
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,

(Philippians 1:26) 
so that through my being with you again, your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

(Philippians 1:27) 
Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the Gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the Gospel,

(Philippians 1:28) 
without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be lost, but that you will be saved—and that by God.

(Philippians 1:29) 
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,

(Philippians 1:30) 
since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

(Philippians 2:1) 
If therefore there is any consolation in the Son, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion:

(Philippians 2:2) 
Then complete my joy, by having the same understanding, having the same charity, being of one mind, thinking the same thing:

(Philippians 2:3) 
Let nothing be done through contention, nor by empty glory: but in humility of mind, let each esteem others better than themselves:

(Philippians 2:4) 
Not considering each the things that are his own, but the things that are of others.

(Philippians 2:5) 
For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

(Philippians 2:6) 
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God:

(Philippians 2:7) 
But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.

(Philippians 2:8) 
He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

(Philippians 2:9) 
For which cause also God hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:

(Philippians 2:10) 
That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:

(Philippians 2:11) 
And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.

(Philippians 2:12) 
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence, with fear and trembling work out your salvation.

(Philippians 2:13) 
For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.

(Philippians 2:14) 
Do all things without murmurings and hesitations:

(Philippians 2:15) 
That you may be blameless and harmless, children of God without reproach, in the midst of a depraved and perverse nation: among whom you shine as lights in the world,

(Philippians 2:16) 
Holding fast the word of life: that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor labored in vain.

(Philippians 2:17) 
But if I am to be sacrificed upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.

(Philippians 2:18) 
And for the same things do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.

(Philippians 2:19) 
But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.

(Philippians 2:20) 
For I have no one so of one mind, who with sincere care for you, will care about the things that are of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 2:21) 
For all seek the things that are their own, not the things that are of Jesus Christ.

(Philippians 2:22) 
But know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.

(Philippians 2:23) 
Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see what shall be about me.

(Philippians 2:24) 
And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you shortly.

(Philippians 2:25) 
But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your apostle and the minister of my need.

(Philippians 2:26) 
Because indeed he longed for you all, and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.

(Philippians 2:27) 
For indeed he was sick, even unto death; but God had mercy on him: and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.

(Philippians 2:28) 
I sent him therefore the more diligently, that, seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful.

(Philippians 2:29) 
Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and such as these hold in honor:

(Philippians 2:30) 
Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death, delivering his life, that he might fulfill that which was wanting of your service towards me.

(Philippians 3:1) 
Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you, and it is a safeguard for you.

(Philippians 3:2) 
Watch out for the dogs! Beware of evil workers! Beware of those who mutilate the flesh.

(Philippians 3:3) 
For we are the circumcision, we who worship God in the Spirit, who rejoice in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh

(Philippians 3:4) 
Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:

(Philippians 3:5) 
circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;

(Philippians 3:6) 
as for zeal, persecuting the Church; as for legal righteousness, faultless.

(Philippians 3:7) 
But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.

(Philippians 3:8) 
Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ

(Philippians 3:9) 
and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith

(Philippians 3:10) 
that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,

(Philippians 3:11) 
that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

(Philippians 3:12) 
Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.

(Philippians 3:13) 
Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,

(Philippians 3:14) 
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 3:15) 
Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal this also to you.

(Philippians 3:16) 
Only let us hold true to what we have attained.

(Philippians 3:17) 
Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.

(Philippians 3:18) 
For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.

(Philippians 3:19) 
Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.

(Philippians 3:20) 
But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,

(Philippians 3:21) 
who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.

(Philippians 4:1) 
So, my beloved brothers and sisters, whom I love and long to see, you who are my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord, my dear ones.

(Philippians 4:2) 
I urge Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree in the Lord.

(Philippians 4:3) 
And I ask you also, my loyal companion, help these women, for they worked with me in the Gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

(Philippians 4:4) 
Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.

(Philippians 4:5) 
Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.

(Philippians 4:6) 
Have no anxiety about anything; but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

(Philippians 4:7) 
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 4:8) 
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

(Philippians 4:9) 
The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, these do: and the God of peace will be with you.

(Philippians 4:10) 
I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me; though you were concerned before, you lacked an opportunity.

(Philippians 4:11) 
Not that I speak in regard to need; for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.

(Philippians 4:12) 
I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.

(Philippians 4:13) 
I can do all things through him who strengthens me.

(Philippians 4:14) 
Yet it was kind of you to share in my trouble.

(Philippians 4:15) 
And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.

(Philippians 4:16) 
For even in Thessalonica you sent me help more than once when I was in need.

(Philippians 4:17) 
Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.

(Philippians 4:18) 
I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.

(Philippians 4:19) 
My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

(Philippians 4:20) 
To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(Philippians 4:21) 
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me greet you.

(Philippians 4:22) 
All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household.

(Philippians 4:23) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

(Colossians 1:1) 
Paul, sent on a mission by the will of God, along with our brother Timothy,

(Colossians 1:2) 
to the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ living in Colossae. May grace and peace come to you from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Colossians 1:3) 
We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,

(Colossians 1:4) 
because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints,

(Colossians 1:5) 
which is founded on the hope you have in the universe. You learned about this hope through the message of the Gospel, which is the truth,

(Colossians 1:6) 
the same Gospel that has come to you and is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God’s grace in all its truth.

(Colossians 1:7) 
You learned this from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,

(Colossians 1:8) 
and who also told us about your love in the Spirit.

(Colossians 1:9) 
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,

(Colossians 1:10) 
so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,

(Colossians 1:11) 
being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,

(Colossians 1:12) 
and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.

(Colossians 1:13) 
For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,

(Colossians 1:14) 
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

(Colossians 1:15) 
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,

(Colossians 1:16) 
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.

(Colossians 1:17) 
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

(Colossians 1:18) 
And he is the head of the body, the Church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

(Colossians 1:19) 
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,

(Colossians 1:20) 
and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

(Colossians 1:21) 
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.

(Colossians 1:22) 
But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.

(Colossians 1:23) 
If you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

(Colossians 1:24) 
Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church,

(Colossians 1:25) 
I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to present to you the word of God in its fullness.

(Colossians 1:26) 
This mystery, which has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s holy people.

(Colossians 1:27) 
To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

(Colossians 1:28) 
We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.

(Colossians 1:29) 
To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.

(Colossians 2:1) 
I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for everyone who has never seen my face in person.

(Colossians 2:2) 
I want them to be encouraged and united by love, enriched with a full understanding, and with the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father, and of Christ.

(Colossians 2:3) 
In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

(Colossians 2:4) 
I say this so that no one will deceive you with smooth words.

(Colossians 2:5) 
Though I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit. I am glad to see your order and the strength of your faith in Christ.

(Colossians 2:6) 
Therefore, since you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him.

(Colossians 2:7) 
Be rooted and built up in him, and strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness.

(Colossians 2:8) 
Be careful that no one deceives you with philosophy, empty deceit, the tradition of men, the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.

(Colossians 2:9) 
For in Christ lives all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

(Colossians 2:10) 
And you have been filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power.

(Colossians 2:11) 
In him you were also circumcised, but not with a circumcision done by human hands; you were set free from the sinful nature of the body, by the circumcision of Christ.

(Colossians 2:12) 
You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.

(Colossians 2:13) 
And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,

(Colossians 2:14) 
blotting out the written code of the decrees that was against us, which was contrary to us; he took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.

(Colossians 2:15) 
He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

(Colossians 2:16) 
Therefore, do not let anyone judge you in respect to food or drink or in respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath.

(Colossians 2:17) 
These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.

(Colossians 2:18) 
Do not let anyone defraud you of your prize by insisting on self-abasement and the worship of angels, dwelling on things that he has not seen, puffed up without cause by his sensuous mind,

(Colossians 2:19) 
and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

(Colossians 2:20) 
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as though you were still living in the world, do you submit to regulations—

(Colossians 2:21) 
“Do not handle,” “Do not taste,” “Do not touch”

(Colossians 2:22) 
(which all are destined to perish with use)—according to human precepts and teachings?

(Colossians 2:23) 
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severity to the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh.

(Colossians 3:1) 
Since you are resurrected with Christ, you should seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God:

(Colossians 3:2) 
You should focus on the things above, not the things of the earth.

(Colossians 3:3) 
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

(Colossians 3:4) 
When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.

(Colossians 3:5) 
Therefore, you must put to death the members of your body that are on the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is the worship of idols.

(Colossians 3:6) 
Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon those who do not believe.

(Colossians 3:7) 
In these things, you too once walked, when you lived among them.

(Colossians 3:8) 
But now, you must rid yourselves of all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and foul language from your mouth.

(Colossians 3:9) 
Do not lie to each other, stripping off the old self with its practices,

(Colossians 3:10) 
and putting on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator,

(Colossians 3:11) 
where there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all.

(Colossians 3:12) 
Therefore, as the chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,

(Colossians 3:13) 
bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must forgive.

(Colossians 3:14) 
Above all these things, have love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

(Colossians 3:15) 
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.

(Colossians 3:16) 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

(Colossians 3:17) 
And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

(Colossians 3:18) 
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

(Colossians 3:19) 
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

(Colossians 3:20) 
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.

(Colossians 3:21) 
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, so they do not become discouraged.

(Colossians 3:22) 
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while they are watching, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.

(Colossians 3:23) 
Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

(Colossians 3:24) 
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.

(Colossians 3:25) 
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for his wrongs, and there is no partiality.

(Colossians 4:1) 
Masters, give to your servants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the universe.

(Colossians 4:2) 
Be persistent in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

(Colossians 4:3) 
Pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound),

(Colossians 4:4) 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

(Colossians 4:5) 
Walk with wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.

(Colossians 4:6) 
Let your speech always be in grace, seasoned with salt: so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

(Colossians 4:7) 
All that concerns me, and what I do, Tychicus, the most dear brother, and faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you:

(Colossians 4:8) 
whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts,

(Colossians 4:9) 
with Onesimus, a faithful and most dear brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things that are done here.

(Colossians 4:10) 
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, salutes you; and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you have received commands: if he comes to you, receive him:

(Colossians 4:11) 
and Jesus, who is called Justus: who are of the circumcision. These alone are fellow workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.

(Colossians 4:12) 
Epaphras, who is one of you, the servant of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.

(Colossians 4:13) 
For I bear him witness that he has much labor for you, and for those who are at Laodicea, and for those who are at Hierapolis.

(Colossians 4:14) 
Luke, the most dear physician, salutes you, and Demas.

(Colossians 4:15) 
Salute the brothers who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.

(Colossians 4:16) 
And when this letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that which is [sent] from Laodicea, read that also among yourselves.

(Colossians 4:17) 
And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”

(Colossians 4:18) 
The greeting by the hand of Paul. Be mindful of my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

(1 Thessalonians 1:1) 
From Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy: to the church of the Thessalonians, who are united to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 1:2) 
Grace to you, and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing,

(1 Thessalonians 1:3) 
constantly remembering your work of faith and your labor, and the love and patience of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father:

(1 Thessalonians 1:4) 
Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election:

(1 Thessalonians 1:5) 
Because our Gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, just as you know what kind of men we were among you, for your sakes.

(1 Thessalonians 1:6) 
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word with much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,

(1 Thessalonians 1:7) 
so that you were made a pattern to all those who believe, in Macedonia and in Achaia.

(1 Thessalonians 1:8) 
For from you has gone forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith, which is toward God, has gone forth, so that we need not to speak anything.

(1 Thessalonians 1:9) 
For they themselves relate of us what kind of entrance we had to you: and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,

(1 Thessalonians 1:10) 
and to await His Son from the universe—Jesus—whom He raised from the dead, who has delivered us from the wrath to come.

(1 Thessalonians 2:1) 
You know yourselves, brothers, that we didn’t come to you in vain, wasting time or energy:

(1 Thessalonians 2:2) 
But after suffering and enduring insults, as you know, in Philippi, we had the courage given to us by God to preach to you in difficult times.

(1 Thessalonians 2:3) 
For our encouragement did not come from error, nor from uncleanness, nor from trickery:

(1 Thessalonians 2:4) 
but as we were proven worthy by God, that the Gospel be entrusted to us, so do we speak, not as those pleasing men, but God, who knows our hearts.

(1 Thessalonians 2:5) 
For at no time were we in speech with flattery, as you know: nor with an occasion for greed: God is witness.

(1 Thessalonians 2:6) 
Nor seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others:

(1 Thessalonians 2:7) 
though we could have been a burden to you, in order to seek the glory of Christ:

(1 Thessalonians 2:8) 
but we became little ones among you, as a mother would nurture her children:

(1 Thessalonians 2:9) 
in this way, we longed for you, and eagerly wished to hand over to you not only the Gospel of God, but also our souls: because you have become very dear to us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:10) 
For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: for working night and day, so that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Gospel of God.

(1 Thessalonians 2:11) 
You are witnesses, and God is too: how holy, just, and blameless we were among you who believed:

(1 Thessalonians 2:12) 
as you know, how we exhorted each of you, as a father does his children,

(1 Thessalonians 2:13) 
assuring, consoling, and testifying to you, that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.

(1 Thessalonians 2:14) 
For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing: because when you received from us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as it truly is the word of God, which works in you who believe.

(1 Thessalonians 2:15) 
For you have become imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: because the same things that they suffered were also suffered by you from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,

(1 Thessalonians 2:16) 
who also killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us, and do not please God, and are against all men,

(1 Thessalonians 2:17) 
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, so that they may always fill up their sins: for the wrath of God has come upon them to the end.

(1 Thessalonians 2:18) 
But we, brothers, being left desolate from you for a time, in appearance, not in heart, we eagerly sought all the more to see your face with great desire.

(1 Thessalonians 2:19) 
Because we wanted to come to you, I, indeed, Paul, once and again: and Satan prevented us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:20) 
For who is our hope, or joy, or the crown of glory? Are you not? Before our Lord Jesus at His coming?

(1 Thessalonians 2:21) 
For you are our glory and joy.

(1 Thessalonians 3:1) 
Because of this, we could not bear to remain alone in Athens.

(1 Thessalonians 3:2) 
So we sent our brother Timothy, a servant of God in the Gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and to exhort you in your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:3) 
We sent him so that no one would be shaken by these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.

(1 Thessalonians 3:4) 
For when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we would suffer tribulation, even as it came to pass, and as you know.

(1 Thessalonians 3:5) 
For this cause, I also, not bearing it any longer, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter has tempted you and our labor become vain.

(1 Thessalonians 3:6) 
But now, Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and your charity and that you have a good memory of us always, desiring to see us, just as we also want to see you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:7) 
Therefore, brothers, we have been comforted about you in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:8) 
Because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 3:9) 
For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before God,

(1 Thessalonians 3:10) 
night and day praying more abundantly that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?

(1 Thessalonians 3:11) 
Now God Himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:12) 
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love towards one another and towards all men, even as we do towards you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:13) 
So that he may establish your hearts without blame, in holiness before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(1 Thessalonians 4:1) 
And now, brothers, we beg you and beseech you in the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is our earnest desire that you continue living the holy life that we have taught you, the life that is pleasing to God, and that you do it even more and more.

(1 Thessalonians 4:2) 
For you know very well what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:3) 
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you stay away from all sexual sin,

(1 Thessalonians 4:4) 
that each of you knows how to control his own body in holiness and honor,

(1 Thessalonians 4:5) 
and not in the lust of passion, as the Gentiles who do not know God do:

(1 Thessalonians 4:6) 
that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you and testified before.

(1 Thessalonians 4:7) 
For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.

(1 Thessalonians 4:8) 
Therefore, he who rejects this, rejects not man, but God, who has also given His Holy Spirit to you.

(1 Thessalonians 4:9) 
Now concerning fraternal love, we do not need to write to you. For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.

(1 Thessalonians 4:10) 
For indeed you do this toward all the brothers who are in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to increase more and more,

(1 Thessalonians 4:11) 
and to strive to be at peace, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we have commanded you,

(1 Thessalonians 4:12) 
so that you may walk honestly toward those who are outside, and that you may not lack anything.

(1 Thessalonians 4:13) 
But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve as the others do who have no hope.

(1 Thessalonians 4:14) 
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:15) 
For this we tell you by the word of the Lord: that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.

(1 Thessalonians 4:16) 
For the Lord Himself, with a command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from the sky: and the dead who are in Christ will rise first.

(1 Thessalonians 4:17) 
Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air: and so we will always be with the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 4:18) 
Therefore, comfort one another with these words.

(1 Thessalonians 5:1) 
Now concerning the times and moments, brothers and sisters, there is no need to write to you about it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:2) 
For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:3) 
When they say “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a woman giving birth, and they will not escape.

(1 Thessalonians 5:4) 
But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, that this day should overtake you as a thief.

(1 Thessalonians 5:5) 
For you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night nor of darkness.

(1 Thessalonians 5:6) 
Therefore let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us keep awake and be sober.

(1 Thessalonians 5:7) 
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:8) 
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of the hope of salvation.

(1 Thessalonians 5:9) 
For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Thessalonians 5:10) 
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.

(1 Thessalonians 5:11) 
Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, as indeed you are doing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:12) 
We ask you, brothers and sisters, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

(1 Thessalonians 5:13) 
and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

(1 Thessalonians 5:14) 
And we exhort you, brothers and sisters, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:15) 
See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good, both for yourselves and for all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:16) 
Rejoice always.

(1 Thessalonians 5:17) 
Pray without ceasing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:18) 
In everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 5:19) 
Do not quench the Spirit.

(1 Thessalonians 5:20) 
Do not despise prophecies,

(1 Thessalonians 5:21) 
but test everything; hold fast to what is good.

(1 Thessalonians 5:22) 
Abstain from every form of evil.

(1 Thessalonians 5:23) 
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 5:24) 
He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:25) 
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

(1 Thessalonians 5:26) 
Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

(1 Thessalonians 5:27) 
I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the holy brothers and sisters.

(1 Thessalonians 5:28) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

(2 Thessalonians 1:1) 
From Paul, Silas, and Timothy, to the Church of the Thessalonians, who are in God our Father, and in Our Lord Jesus Christ:

(2 Thessalonians 1:2) 
May grace and peace be given to you from God our Father, and from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 1:3) 
We ought to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is proper, because your faith increases so much, and the charity of each one of you abounds toward one another:

(2 Thessalonians 1:4) 
so that we ourselves may glory in you in the churches of God, because of your patience and faith in all your persecutions, and in the tribulations that you endure,

(2 Thessalonians 1:5) 
This is proof of God’s just judgment, that you may be worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:

(2 Thessalonians 1:6) 
Because it is just for God to repay with tribulation those who afflict you:

(2 Thessalonians 1:7) 
and to give rest to you who are afflicted, along with us, at the revelation of Our Lord Jesus Christ with the angels of His power,

(2 Thessalonians 1:8) 
in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and who do not obey the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ:

(2 Thessalonians 1:9) 
These people will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power:

(2 Thessalonians 1:10) 
On that day, He will come to be glorified among His holy ones, and to be admired among all who have believed (because our testimony among you was believed).

(2 Thessalonians 1:11) 
Therefore, we always pray for you: that God may deem you worthy of His calling, and may fulfill every desire of goodness, and the work of faith in power,

(2 Thessalonians 1:12) 
so that the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God, and Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 2:1) 
Now, brothers, we beg you about the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering to Him.

(2 Thessalonians 2:2) 
Don't let anyone easily shake your faith, nor should you be frightened, whether by a spirit, or by a word, or by a letter as if sent by us, that the Day of the Lord is present.

(2 Thessalonians 2:3) 
Let no one deceive you in any way. Because the Day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy has come first, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, has been revealed,

(2 Thessalonians 2:4) 
Who opposes and elevates himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped. This man will sit in the temple of God, showing himself as if he is God.

(2 Thessalonians 2:5) 
Don't you remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?

(2 Thessalonians 2:6) 
Now you know what restrains him, so that he may be revealed in his time.

(2 Thessalonians 2:7) 
For the mystery of iniquity is already at work, only until he who now restrains is taken out of the way.

(2 Thessalonians 2:8) 
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of His mouth, and will destroy with the brightness of His coming.

(2 Thessalonians 2:9) 
This man's coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and wonders of lies,

(2 Thessalonians 2:10) 
and in all the deceits of wickedness for those who perish, because they didn't accept the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

(2 Thessalonians 2:11) 
And therefore God will send them the operation of error, that they should believe a lie:

(2 Thessalonians 2:12) 
so that all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but who consented to iniquity.

(2 Thessalonians 2:13) 
But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brothers beloved by God, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation, in the sanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth:

(2 Thessalonians 2:14) 
to which He called you through our Gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 2:15) 
So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught, either by word of mouth, or by our letter.

(2 Thessalonians 2:16) 
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God and our Father, who loved us, and gave everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,

(2 Thessalonians 2:17) 
exhort your hearts, and confirm them in every good work and word.

(2 Thessalonians 3:1) 
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord spreads and is glorified, just as it is with you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:2) 
And pray that we might be delivered from unreasonable and evil men. Because not everyone has faith.

(2 Thessalonians 3:3) 
But God is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from evil.

(2 Thessalonians 3:4) 
Moreover, we trust in the Lord concerning you, that you both do the things that we command you, and will do them.

(2 Thessalonians 3:5) 
And may the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and in the patience of Christ.

(2 Thessalonians 3:6) 
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they received from us.

(2 Thessalonians 3:7) 
For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us: because we did not act disorderly among you,

(2 Thessalonians 3:8) 
nor did we eat anyone's bread for free, but we worked in labor and toil night and day, so that we would not burden any of you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:9) 
Not because we did not have the authority, but to give ourselves as a model to you, so that you might imitate us.

(2 Thessalonians 3:10) 
For even when we were with you, we were commanding you this: that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.

(2 Thessalonians 3:11) 
For we hear that some of you are walking disorderly, doing no work, but acting as busybodies.

(2 Thessalonians 3:12) 
Now those of that kind we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly, they eat their own bread.

(2 Thessalonians 3:13) 
But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.

(2 Thessalonians 3:14) 
And if anyone does not obey our word through this letter, note this one, and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.

(2 Thessalonians 3:15) 
And do not consider him an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

(2 Thessalonians 3:16) 
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every place. The Lord be with all of you.

(2 Thessalonians 3:17) 
The greeting by my own hand, Paul, which is the sign in every letter; I write in this way.

(2 Thessalonians 3:18) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.

(1 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the command of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope,

(1 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, a beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.

(1 Timothy 1:3) 
As I requested you to stay in Ephesus, on my way to Macedonia, so that you would command certain people not to teach differently,

(1 Timothy 1:4) 
nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which give rise to disputes, rather than to the edification of God, which is in faith.

(1 Timothy 1:5) 
Now the goal of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.

(1 Timothy 1:6) 
From these things some, having strayed, are turned aside to vain speech,

(1 Timothy 1:7) 
desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor the things concerning which they make affirmation.

(1 Timothy 1:8) 
But we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully:

(1 Timothy 1:9) 
knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the impious and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers,

(1 Timothy 1:10) 
fornicators, those who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if there is anything else that goes against sound doctrine;

(1 Timothy 1:11) 
according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was entrusted to me.

(1 Timothy 1:12) 
And I give thanks to him who has strengthened me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, because he has judged me faithful, putting me into the ministry,

(1 Timothy 1:13) 
who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.

(1 Timothy 1:14) 
And the grace of our Lord abounded with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 1:15) 
Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

(1 Timothy 1:16) 
But for this reason I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth all patience, for the example of those who would believe in him unto life everlasting.

(1 Timothy 1:17) 
Now to the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(1 Timothy 1:18) 
This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,

(1 Timothy 1:19) 
holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having thrust aside, have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith.

(1 Timothy 1:20) 
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

(1 Timothy 2:1) 
I ask, then, that, first of all, that there be prayers of supplication, prayers of petition, and thanksgiving offered for all people:

(1 Timothy 2:2) 
Pray for those in authority, and all those who govern, so that we may live a calm and tranquil life, with all piety and chastity.

(1 Timothy 2:3) 
This is good, and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior,

(1 Timothy 2:4) 
Who wills all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

(1 Timothy 2:5) 
For there is only one God, and only one mediator between God and humankind, the man Christ Jesus:

(1 Timothy 2:6) 
Who gave Himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in his own time:

(1 Timothy 2:7) 
I, Paul, have been placed as a herald, and an apostle—I speak the truth and do not lie—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

(1 Timothy 2:8) 
I want, therefore, men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger or quarreling.

(1 Timothy 2:9) 
Likewise, women should adorn themselves in modest apparel, with decency and moderation, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly clothes,

(1 Timothy 2:10) 
but with good works, as befits women who profess godliness.

(1 Timothy 2:11) 
Let a woman learn in silence, with all subjection.

(1 Timothy 2:12) 
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.

(1 Timothy 2:13) 
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

(1 Timothy 2:14) 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

(1 Timothy 2:15) 
But she will be saved through childbirth, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with moderation.

(1 Timothy 3:1) 
This is a true statement: If a man desires to be a bishop, he is reaching for an honorable work.

(1 Timothy 3:2) 
A bishop, therefore, must be above reproach, he must be a one-woman man, sober, prudent, respectable, chaste, hospitable, and able to teach,

(1 Timothy 3:3) 
not a drunkard or a brawler, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy,

(1 Timothy 3:4) 
one who manages his own household well, with his children in submission with all dignity.

(1 Timothy 3:5) 
(For if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)

(1 Timothy 3:6) 
He must not be a recent convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and fall into the devil's judgment.

(1 Timothy 3:7) 
Moreover, he must have a good reputation with those outside the Church, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil's snare.

(1 Timothy 3:8) 
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for sordid gain.

(1 Timothy 3:9) 
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.

(1 Timothy 3:10) 
Let these also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.

(1 Timothy 3:11) 
Women, in like manner, must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober and trustworthy in everything.

(1 Timothy 3:12) 
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, and let them manage their children and their own households well.

(1 Timothy 3:13) 
For those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 3:14) 
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon,

(1 Timothy 3:15) 
but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.

(1 Timothy 3:16) 
And without doubt, the mystery of godliness is great: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

(1 Timothy 4:1) 
The Spirit clearly says that in the final days, some will abandon the faith, listening to the spirits of error and the teachings of demons.

(1 Timothy 4:2) 
They will be deceivers, and their consciences will be seared.

(1 Timothy 4:3) 
They will forbid marriage and tell people to abstain from certain foods. God created these foods to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

(1 Timothy 4:4) 
Everything God made is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving:

(1 Timothy 4:5) 
It is made holy by the word of God and prayer.

(1 Timothy 4:6) 
By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of the faith and the good teaching that you have followed.

(1 Timothy 4:7) 
But reject profane and old wives' tales, and train yourself to be a man of faith.

(1 Timothy 4:8) 
Physical training has some value, but faith is valuable in every way. It promises life now and in the future.

(1 Timothy 4:9) 
This is a faithful saying, worthy of all acceptance.

(1 Timothy 4:10) 
We work hard and suffer insults for this, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

(1 Timothy 4:11) 
Command and teach these things.

(1 Timothy 4:12) 
Let no one look down on your youth. Instead, be an example for the believers in your speech, in your conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.

(1 Timothy 4:13) 
Until I come, focus on reading the Scriptures, exhorting others, and teaching.

(1 Timothy 4:14) 
Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.

(1 Timothy 4:15) 
Meditate on these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.

(1 Timothy 4:16) 
Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in them, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

(1 Timothy 5:1) 
Never scold an older man, but instead implore him as if he were your own father. Treat younger men as brothers.

(1 Timothy 5:2) 
Treat older women as mothers. Treat younger women as sisters—in all purity.

(1 Timothy 5:3) 
Give honor to widows who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:4) 
If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to manage their own household and to repay their parents and grandparents; for this is acceptable before God.

(1 Timothy 5:5) 
Now, she who is truly a widow, and desolate, hopes in God, and persists in prayers night and day.

(1 Timothy 5:6) 
But she who is self-indulgent is dead while she lives.

(1 Timothy 5:7) 
Give these instructions, so that they may be blameless.

(1 Timothy 5:8) 
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

(1 Timothy 5:9) 
Let a widow be chosen if she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband,

(1 Timothy 5:10) 
having a testimony of good works: if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.

(1 Timothy 5:11) 
But refuse younger widows. For when they have grown luxurious against Christ, they want to marry,

(1 Timothy 5:12) 
having condemnation, because they have set aside their first faith.

(1 Timothy 5:13) 
At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things which they ought not.

(1 Timothy 5:14) 
Therefore, I want younger women to marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity for reproach.

(1 Timothy 5:15) 
For some have already turned aside after Satan.

(1 Timothy 5:16) 
If any believing man or woman has widows, let them provide for them, and let not the Church be burdened, so that it may suffice for those who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:17) 
Let the presbyters who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in doctrine.

(1 Timothy 5:18) 
For the Scripture says: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”

(1 Timothy 5:19) 
Do not receive an accusation against a presbyter, except under two or three witnesses.

(1 Timothy 5:20) 
Those who sin, rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.

(1 Timothy 5:21) 
I solemnly charge you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality.

(1 Timothy 5:22) 
Lay hands on no one hastily, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself chaste.

(1 Timothy 5:23) 
No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach, and your frequent infirmities.

(1 Timothy 5:24) 
The sins of some men are evident, preceding them to judgment, while the sins of others follow them.

(1 Timothy 5:25) 
Likewise, the good works are evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

(1 Timothy 6:1) 
Those who are slaves must consider their masters worthy of all honor. This is to prevent the name of God and His teaching from being dishonored.

(1 Timothy 6:2) 
Those who have faithful masters shouldn't despise them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve even more diligently, because those masters are faithful and beloved and share in the benefit of Christ. Teach these things, and urge them upon others.

(1 Timothy 6:3) 
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not adhere to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching that accords with true devotion,

(1 Timothy 6:4) 
he is conceited and knows nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and quarrels about words. These disputes produce envy, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,

(1 Timothy 6:5) 
and the wrangling of people who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Stay away from such people.

(1 Timothy 6:6) 
But godliness with contentment is great gain.

(1 Timothy 6:7) 
For we brought nothing into this world, and we cannot take anything out of it.

(1 Timothy 6:8) 
But if we have food and clothing, with these things we should be content.

(1 Timothy 6:9) 
Those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

(1 Timothy 6:10) 
For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some, yearning for, have gone astray from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

(1 Timothy 6:11) 
But you, man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

(1 Timothy 6:12) 
Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called and made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.

(1 Timothy 6:13) 
I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate,

(1 Timothy 6:14) 
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Timothy 6:15) 
which He will manifest at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

(1 Timothy 6:16) 
who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

(1 Timothy 6:17) 
Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.

(1 Timothy 6:18) 
Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,

(1 Timothy 6:19) 
storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.

(1 Timothy 6:20) 
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge.

(1 Timothy 6:21) 
By professing such knowledge, some have gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.

(2 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of eternal life, which is in Christ Jesus,

(2 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, my dearest son: grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

(2 Timothy 1:3) 
I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did. I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day,

(2 Timothy 1:4) 
longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,

(2 Timothy 1:5) 
I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it lives in you as well.

(2 Timothy 1:6) 
For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

(2 Timothy 1:7) 
For God gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control.

(2 Timothy 1:8) 
So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share in suffering for the Gospel according to the power of God,

(2 Timothy 1:9) 
who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of His own purpose and grace, which He gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

(2 Timothy 1:10) 
and which now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel,

(2 Timothy 1:11) 
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.

(2 Timothy 1:12) 
That is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.

(2 Timothy 1:13) 
Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 1:14) 
Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.

(2 Timothy 1:15) 
You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

(2 Timothy 1:16) 
May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,

(2 Timothy 1:17) 
but when he arrived in Rome, he searched for me even more eagerly until he found me.

(2 Timothy 1:18) 
May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well how many ways he served me in Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:1) 
Therefore, my son, strengthen yourself by relying on the grace that is only found in Jesus Christ.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:2) 
The truths you have heard from me, which were confirmed by many witnesses, entrust these teachings to faithful and trustworthy men who will also be capable of teaching these same truths to others.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:3) 
Work hard and endure difficulty, just like a good soldier of Christ Jesus must.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:4) 
No one who is serving as a soldier allows himself to be entangled in worldly affairs, because his main goal is to please the one who enlisted him.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:5) 
Similarly, if someone competes in an athletic contest, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the established rules.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:6) 
The hardworking farmer is the one who should be the first to receive a share of the harvest.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:7) 
Consider carefully what I am saying, because the Lord will grant you understanding in all these matters.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:8) 
Always remember that Jesus Christ Our Lord, a descendant of David, was raised from the dead. This is the central truth of the Gospel I preach.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:9) 
Because of this Gospel, I suffer hardship and am even imprisoned, as if I were a criminal. But the Word of God, which is Jesus Christ and His teachings, cannot be imprisoned.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:10) 
Because of this, I endure all these things for the sake of God's elect, so that they, too, may obtain the eternal salvation that is found in Jesus Christ, along with the glory of heaven.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:11) 
This is a trustworthy saying: If we have died with Him through baptism and penance, we will also live with Him in eternal life.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:12) 
If we persevere in suffering for Him, we will also reign with Him. But if we deny Him, He will also deny us on the day of judgment.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:13) 
Even if we are faithless, He remains faithful to His promises, for He cannot deny His own divine nature.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:14) 
Remind everyone of these truths, solemnly testifying before the Lord. Warn them not to engage in useless arguments about words, for such debates are good for nothing except leading those who listen to spiritual ruin.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:15) 
Strive diligently to present yourself to God as a worker who is approved and has no need to be ashamed, because you are accurately handling the Word of Truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:16) 
However, avoid profane and empty talk and innovative theories, for these only lead people further into ungodliness.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:17) 
Their teachings will spread like gangrene, and among these false teachers are Hymenæus and Philetus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:18) 
These men have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and in doing so, they have undermined the faith of certain individuals.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:19) 
Nevertheless, the unshakeable foundation of God stands firm, sealed with this double inscription: 'The Lord knows those who are His,' and 'Everyone who invokes the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.'

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:20) 
In a large household, there are not only vessels made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some of these are used for honorable purposes, while others are for common or dishonorable use.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:21) 
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from such false teachings and corrupt practices, he will become a vessel set apart for honorable use, sanctified, useful to the Lord, and ready for every good work.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:22) 
Flee from youthful desires, and instead, earnestly pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, doing so with all those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:23) 
But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing full well that they only lead to quarrels.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:24) 
A servant of the Lord must not quarrel; instead, he must be gentle towards everyone, capable of teaching, and patient when wronged.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:25) 
He must humbly correct those who oppose the truth, in the hope that God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:26) 
In this way, they might escape from the devil’s snare, having been captured by him to do his will.

(2 Timothy 3:1) 
But understand this truth: in the final days of history, perilous times will be upon us.

(2 Timothy 3:2) 
For at that time, people will be consumed with love for themselves, obsessed with money, filled with pride and arrogance, blasphemers, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful for blessings, and entirely unholy.

(2 Timothy 3:3) 
They will lack natural affection, be unforgiving, eager to accuse falsely, without self-control, brutal, and without any love for what is good.

(2 Timothy 3:4) 
They will be betrayers, recklessly defiant, puffed up with self-importance, and will love worldly pleasures more than they love God.

(2 Timothy 3:5) 
They will maintain an outward appearance of piety, but they will deny the true power and virtue of it in their lives. You must turn away from such people.

(2 Timothy 3:6) 
For among these sorts of people are those who slyly infiltrate private homes, leading astray impressionable women who are burdened by their sins and easily swayed by various worldly desires.

(2 Timothy 3:7) 
These women are always learning, yet they never come to a full and certain knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 3:8) 
Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses with their magic, so do these false teachers resist the divine truth. They are men with corrupted minds, whose faith has been rejected and found wanting.

(2 Timothy 3:9) 
But they will not make any further progress, because their foolishness will become obvious to everyone, just as the foolishness of Jannes and Jambres was made manifest.

(2 Timothy 3:10) 
But you, Timothy, have thoroughly observed and followed my teaching, my manner of life, my true purpose, my faith, my patience with others, my love for all, and my perseverance through suffering.

(2 Timothy 3:11) 
You have also seen my persecutions and sufferings—what I went through in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what intense persecutions I endured, yet out of all of them, the Lord truly delivered me.

(2 Timothy 3:12) 
In fact, everyone who truly desires to live a life of piety united with Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

(2 Timothy 3:13) 
But wicked people and deceivers will only continue to grow worse, always going astray themselves and leading others into error.

(2 Timothy 3:14) 
But you, Timothy, must continue steadfastly in the truths you have learned and which have been entrusted to you, knowing the trustworthy teachers from whom you received them.

(2 Timothy 3:15) 
And know that from your very childhood, you have been familiar with the sacred Scriptures, which possess the power to instruct you unto salvation, through the active faith that you have in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 3:16) 
All of Sacred Scripture is inspired by God's own breath; therefore, it is profitable for teaching sound doctrine, for convicting the conscience, for correcting sinful behavior, and for training in all righteousness.

(2 Timothy 3:17) 
This is so that the man consecrated to God may be fully complete and perfectly equipped for every good work.

(2 Timothy 4:1) 
I solemnly charge you before God the Father, and Christ Jesus, who will judge both the living and the dead by His Second Coming and His Eternal Reign.

(2 Timothy 4:2) 
Preach the true word of God. Be ready and urgent in season and out of season. Correct those who err, entreat the wavering, and rebuke the obstinate, doing all of this with great patience and careful teaching.

(2 Timothy 4:3) 
For there will come a time when people will no longer tolerate sound doctrine. Instead, they will gather teachers for themselves who cater to their own desires, because they have itching ears, desiring only what they want to hear.

(2 Timothy 4:4) 
They will turn away from truly hearing the truth, and will instead turn to fables and myths.

(2 Timothy 4:5) 
But you, for your part, stay watchful in all things. Endure hardships. Perform the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry completely.

(2 Timothy 4:6) 
For I am already being poured out like a libation in sacrifice, and the time for my departure from this life is at hand.

(2 Timothy 4:7) 
I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the Catholic Faith.

(2 Timothy 4:8) 
From now on, the crown of justice is reserved for me, which the Lord, the just Judge, will give to me on that Day of Judgment. This crown is not for me alone, but also for all those who love His coming.

(2 Timothy 4:9) 
Make every effort to come to me quickly.

(2 Timothy 4:10) 
For Demas has abandoned me because he loved this present world, and he has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

(2 Timothy 4:11) 
Luke is the only one with me now. Take Mark with you and bring him along, for he is very useful to me in ministry.

(2 Timothy 4:12) 
However, I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 4:13) 
When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas. Also bring the books, and especially the parchments.

(2 Timothy 4:14) 
Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me great harm. May the Lord repay him according to his deeds.

(2 Timothy 4:15) 
You also must avoid him, for he strongly opposed our message.

(2 Timothy 4:16) 
At my first defense in court, no one stood with me, but everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.

(2 Timothy 4:17) 
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching of the Gospel might be fully accomplished, and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the mouth of the lion.

(2 Timothy 4:18) 
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(2 Timothy 4:19) 
Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.

(2 Timothy 4:20) 
Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

(2 Timothy 4:21) 
Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.

(2 Timothy 4:22) 
May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May grace be with you all. Amen.

(Titus 1:1:1) 
Paul, a servant of God, and moreover an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith that God chose for His people, and according to the knowledge of the truth that leads to genuine godliness.

(Titus 1:1:2) 
This is all for the hope of eternal life, which God—He who cannot lie—promised even before the ages of time began.

(Titus 1:1:3) 
But at the proper time, God revealed His Word through the preaching that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:4) 
To Titus, my beloved son in our common faith: May grace and peace be with you from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:5) 
For this very purpose I left you behind in Crete: to set right what was still unfinished and to appoint priests—who are spiritual leaders—in every city, just as I instructed you.

(Titus 1:1:6) 
For a priest must be a man without blemish, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who are not accused of wild living or being disobedient.

(Titus 1:1:7) 
For a bishop—as God’s steward—must be without blemish; he must not be arrogant, not quick-tempered, not prone to much wine, not violent, and not greedy for dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:8) 
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, and self-controlled.

(Titus 1:1:9) 
He must hold fast to the faithful teaching that is in line with true doctrine, so that he may be able to encourage others with sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it.

(Titus 1:1:10) 
For there are many disobedient people, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially those who insist on circumcision.

(Titus 1:1:11) 
It is necessary to silence them, for they are overthrowing entire households by teaching things they ought not to, all for the sake of dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:12) 
One of their own, a prophet from among them, once said: 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.'

(Titus 1:1:13) 
This testimony is true. For this reason, you must rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith.

(Titus 1:1:14) 
They must no longer pay attention to Jewish fables and to the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

(Titus 1:1:15) 
To those who are pure, everything is pure. But to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, for both their mind and conscience are defiled.

(Titus 1:1:16) 
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:1) 
But you, Titus, must teach what is appropriate for sound, holy doctrine.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:2) 
Tell the older men to be sober, prudent, self-controlled, and sound in their faith, in their charity for others, and in their patience.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:3) 
Likewise, tell the older women to conduct themselves in a holy manner. They must not be slanderers, nor should they be enslaved to much wine, but rather they should be good teachers of what is right.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:4) 
This way, they can teach the younger women to be prudent and to love their husbands and their children,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:5) 
to be discreet, chaste, self-controlled, managing their households well, kind, and submissive to their own husbands. This way, the word of God will not be blasphemed or spoken ill of.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:6) 
Likewise, encourage the younger men to be self-controlled in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:7) 
In everything, you yourself, Titus, must set an example of good works for them. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, and seriousness,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:8) 
and let your message be sound and beyond reproach. This way, any opponent will be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us Christians.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:9) 
Tell servants to be submissive to their own masters in everything. They should be pleasing to them, not talking back,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:10) 
not stealing, but rather demonstrating complete trustworthiness in everything, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:11) 
For the grace of God, our Savior, has appeared to all mankind,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:12) 
training us, the faithful, to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires. The grace of God teaches us to live soberly, justly, and piously in this present age,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:13) 
while we await the blessed hope: the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:14) 
He gave Himself for us, in order that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do good works.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:15) 
Say these things, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:1) 
Remind them to submit to the governmental rulers and the authorities, to always obey what is commanded by law, and to be ready and willing for every good work.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:2) 
Remind them not to speak evil of anyone, not to be quarrelsome but to be gentle, always showing perfect humility and kindness to all people.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:3) 
For at one time, we ourselves were also foolish and without understanding, disobedient to God's law, deceived by sin, enslaved to many kinds of earthly desires and corrupt pleasures, living lives full of malice and envy, hateful to others, and always hating one another.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:4) 
But then, the goodness of God and the loving kindness of our Divine Savior, Our Lord Jesus Christ, was fully revealed to us.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:5) 
He saved us, not because of any righteous deeds that we ourselves had done, but solely according to His own great mercy. He saved us through the life-giving washing of Baptism, which is the renewal and rebirth given by the Holy Spirit.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:6) 
God poured out this same Holy Spirit on us in abundance, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:7) 
This was so that, having been justified and made righteous by His grace and favor, we might become true heirs to His promises, holding the certain hope of eternal life.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:8) 
This is a most trustworthy saying. And concerning these things, I want you to teach and insist constantly, so that those who truly believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. These are indeed good and truly profitable things for all mankind.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:9) 
But avoid foolish questions and pointless debates, and endless genealogies, and quarrels and legal disputes over the Law; for these things are useless and completely worthless.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:10) 
As for a man who promotes heresy and division within the Church, after you have warned him once and then a second time, have nothing more to do with him or his teachings.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:11) 
You should know that a person like this is thoroughly corrupted and is actively sinning, because he stands condemned by his own self-chosen judgment and his rejection of the truth.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:12) 
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis as quickly as possible, for I have made plans to spend the winter there.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:13) 
Diligently help Zenas, who is an expert in the Law, and Apollos on their journey, making sure that they lack nothing they might need.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:14) 
And let our Christian people also learn to devote themselves to doing good works, especially for urgent and necessary needs, so that they will not be unproductive or useless in their faith.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:15) 
Everyone who is with me here sends their greetings to you. Greet all those who love us because of our shared faith in Christ. May the grace and divine favor of God be with all of you always. Amen.

(Philemon 1:1) 
Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother in faith, to Philemon, our beloved coworker,

(Philemon 1:2) 
and to Apphia, our sister in faith, to Archippus, our fellow soldier for Christ, and to the Church that meets in your home.

(Philemon 1:3) 
Grace and peace be with you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Philemon 1:4) 
I always thank my God and remember you in my prayers,

(Philemon 1:5) 
because I hear about your love and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus Christ, and how you show it to all the holy people in the Church.

(Philemon 1:6) 
I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through your recognition of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:7) 
For I have received great joy and comfort from your love, because you have refreshed the hearts and lives of the holy people, my brother.

(Philemon 1:8) 
Therefore, although I have much confidence in Christ to command you to do what is proper,

(Philemon 1:9) 
I rather appeal to you because of love. I, Paul, am an old man now, and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus.

(Philemon 1:10) 
I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus, whom I have fathered spiritually while I have been in prison.

(Philemon 1:11) 
He was once useless to you, but now he is useful to both you and me.

(Philemon 1:12) 
I am sending him back to you. Please receive him, that is to say, receive my very heart and soul.

(Philemon 1:13) 
I truly wanted to keep him with me, so that he could serve me on your behalf while I am in prison for the Gospel.

(Philemon 1:14) 
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but rather a voluntary act of your free will.

(Philemon 1:15) 
For perhaps he departed from you for a short time for this very reason: that you might have him back forever,

(Philemon 1:16) 
no longer as a slave, but as a beloved brother—far more than a slave. He is especially beloved to me, and how much more so to you, both physically (in the flesh) and spiritually (in the Lord)?

(Philemon 1:17) 
So if you consider me a partner in the faith, welcome him as you would welcome me.

(Philemon 1:18) 
If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge it to my account.

(Philemon 1:19) 
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay you. I do not need to mention that you owe me even your very self.

(Philemon 1:20) 
Yes, my brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart and soul in Christ.

(Philemon 1:21) 
I write to you confident in your obedience, knowing that you will do even more than what I am asking.

(Philemon 1:22) 
Also, at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.

(Philemon 1:23) 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings.

(Philemon 1:24) 
Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers, also greet you.

(Philemon 1:25) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

(Hebrews 1:1) 
In many and various ways, God spoke in times past to our fathers through the Prophets.

(Hebrews 1:2) 
But in these last days, He has spoken to us through the Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He also created the ages and the universe.

(Hebrews 1:3) 
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory, and the exact representation of His very being. He sustains all things by His powerful Word. After He had made purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Divine Majesty on high.

(Hebrews 1:4) 
He became so much superior to the angels, just as the Name He inherited is more excellent than theirs.

(Hebrews 1:5) 
For to which of the angels did God ever say: 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You'? And again: 'I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to Me'?

(Hebrews 1:6) 
And when God again introduces the Firstborn into the world, He says: 'And let all the angels of God worship Him'.

(Hebrews 1:7) 
And concerning the angels, indeed, He says: 'Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire'.

(Hebrews 1:8) 
But to the Son He says: 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. Your rule is perfectly just'.

(Hebrews 1:9) 
You have loved justice and hated iniquity. Therefore, God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

(Hebrews 1:10) 
And: 'You, O Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the universe is the work of Your hands'.

(Hebrews 1:11) 
They will perish, but You remain. And they will all grow old like a garment.

(Hebrews 1:12) 
Like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not come to an end.

(Hebrews 1:13) 
But to which of the angels has God ever said: 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet'?

(Hebrews 1:14) 
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth on a mission to serve on behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?

(Hebrews 2:1) 
Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to the truths we have heard, so that we do not drift away from God’s truth.

(Hebrews 2:2) 
For if the Old Law, which was spoken to us through angels, was established as true and firm, and every transgression and act of disobedience to that Law received a just and deserved punishment,

(Hebrews 2:3) 
how shall we escape God’s judgment if we neglect this great salvation? This salvation was first announced directly by the Lord Himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who personally heard Him speak.

(Hebrews 2:4) 
God also bore witness to this salvation through signs, wonders, and various powerful miracles, along with distributions of the Holy Spirit’s gifts, all according to His own divine will.

(Hebrews 2:5) 
For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, the new order of creation that we are now speaking about.

(Hebrews 2:6) 
However, someone once testified in Scripture, saying: 'What is man, that You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him?'

(Hebrews 2:7) 
You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor, and You appointed him over all the works of Your hands.

(Hebrews 2:8) 
You put all things under his feet.' Indeed, by subjecting all things to him, God left nothing that is not subject to man. However, right now, we do not yet see all things fully subjected to man in the world.

(Hebrews 2:9) 
But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels—we see Him crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of His death. He suffered death for every single person, so that through this experience, He might be made fully suitable and perfect to be our merciful High Priest.

(Hebrews 2:10) 
For it was entirely fitting that God the Father—for Whom and through Whom all things exist—in bringing many sons and daughters into His glory, would make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.

(Hebrews 2:11) 
For both He who makes holy (Jesus Christ) and those who are made holy (the faithful) are all from one Father. For this reason, Christ is not ashamed to call them His brothers and sisters, saying:

(Hebrews 2:12) 
'I will proclaim Your Name to My brothers and sisters. In the midst of the assembled Church, I will sing Your praises.'

(Hebrews 2:13) 
And again He says, 'I will put My trust completely in Him.' And again, 'Here I am, with the children God has given Me.'

(Hebrews 2:14) 
Since these children of God share a common human nature of flesh and blood, Jesus Himself likewise fully partook in that very same nature. He did this so that through His own death, He might destroy the one who holds the dominion of death, which is the devil,

(Hebrews 2:15) 
and so that He might free all those who, throughout their entire lives, were held in bondage by the constant fear of death.

(Hebrews 2:16) 
For He certainly did not come to the aid of angels, nor did He take on their nature; rather, He took on the nature of humanity, specifically, the descendants of Abraham.

(Hebrews 2:17) 
Therefore, it was necessary for Him to be made like His brothers and sisters in every single way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in service to God. Through this, He would make atonement and propitiation for the sins of His people.

(Hebrews 2:18) 
For because He Himself suffered and was tempted, He is now powerfully able to come to the aid of those who are also being tempted.

(Hebrews 3:1) 
Therefore, my holy brothers and sisters, you who share in a heavenly calling, focus your attention on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our faith.

(Hebrews 3:2) 
He is faithful to God, who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all of God's own household.

(Hebrews 3:3) 
For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.

(Hebrews 3:4) 
For every house is built by someone, but the One who built all things is God.

(Hebrews 3:5) 
And Moses was certainly faithful in all of God's household as a servant, testifying to the things that would be revealed later.

(Hebrews 3:6) 
But Christ is faithful as a Son presiding over His own household. We are that household, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the glorious boast of our hope until the very end.

(Hebrews 3:7) 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: 'Today, if you hear His voice,

(Hebrews 3:8) 
do not harden your hearts, just as during the provocation on the day of testing in the wilderness,

(Hebrews 3:9) 
where your ancestors tested My patience and proved My power, even though they saw My works for forty years.

(Hebrews 3:10) 
That is why I was greatly provoked with that generation, and I declared: 'These people always go astray in their hearts. Indeed, they have not known My ways,' 

(Hebrews 3:11) 
just as I swore in My anger, 'They shall never enter into My rest.''

(Hebrews 3:12) 
Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you should ever have an evil, unbelieving heart that would lead you to fall away from the living God.

(Hebrews 3:13) 
Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is still called 'Today,' so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

(Hebrews 3:14) 
For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold firmly to the very foundation of our confidence in Him until the end.

(Hebrews 3:15) 
As it is said, 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts just as in that ancient provocation.'

(Hebrews 3:16) 
For some, when they heard God's voice, rebelled against Him. However, not everyone who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses rebelled.

(Hebrews 3:17) 
And with whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies lay dead and scattered in the wilderness?

(Hebrews 3:18) 
And to whom did God swear that they would not enter into His rest, if not to those who were unbelieving?

(Hebrews 3:19) 
So we see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:1) 
Therefore, let us be seriously concerned and afraid that, even though the promise of entering into God's eternal rest is still available, some among you may be considered to have failed to enter it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:2) 
For indeed, the Good News was preached to us, just as it was to that earlier generation in the desert. But the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in the hearts of those who heard it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:3) 
For we who have believed are truly entering into God's rest, just as God said concerning the disobedient generation of Israel: 'As I swore in My wrath, they shall certainly not enter into My rest.' And yet, God's works, the finished creation of the universe and the earth, were completed from the very moment the world was founded, meaning the rest was always prepared.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:4) 
For God spoke in a specific passage concerning the seventh day, saying exactly this: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:5) 
And again, in that same passage, God emphasizes the condition: 'They shall certainly not enter into My rest.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:6) 
Since, therefore, it still remains for some people to enter into that eternal rest, and since those to whom the Good News was first proclaimed did not enter because of their deep-seated unbelief and disobedience,

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:7) 
God again defines a specific time for entry, emphasizing it as 'Today,' speaking through the Psalms of David after such a long period of time. Just as it was said earlier: 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:8) 
For if Joshua, who led the Israelites, had given them the *true* rest—the ultimate and perfect rest God intended—God would never have spoken of another 'today' or another time of rest after that.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:9) 
Therefore, a true and spiritual Sabbath rest, a participation in God's eternal peace and completion, remains for the people of God.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:10) 
For whoever has entered into God's rest has also ceased from his own works and efforts to earn salvation, just as God ceased from His works of creation after they were finished.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:11) 
Let us therefore make every effort and hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same example of stubborn unbelief and disobedience shown by the ancient Israelites.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:12) 
For the Word of God is alive and actively working. It is more piercing and decisive than any two-edged sword, and it reaches even to the deepest separation of soul and spirit, even to the joints and the marrow, fully discerning and judging the hidden thoughts and true intentions of the human heart.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:13) 
And there is no creature, no part of creation, that is invisible or hidden from His sight. Indeed, all things are laid bare and are completely open before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:14) 
Therefore, since we have such a great High Priest who has passed through the created cosmos and ascended into the presence of God Himself—Jesus, the Son of God—let us hold firmly to our confession of faith in Him.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:15) 
For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize with our human weaknesses and sufferings. Rather, we have One who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without committing any sin.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:16) 
Therefore, let us approach with bold confidence to the throne of God's grace, so that we may receive His divine mercy and find His grace to help us precisely when it is most needed.

(Hebrews 5:1) 
Every high priest, taken from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of humanity in matters that pertain to God. His role is to offer up gifts and make sacrifices to atone for sins.

(Hebrews 5:2) 
Because he himself is subject to human weakness, he is able to feel compassion for those who act ignorantly and who make mistakes.

(Hebrews 5:3) 
And because of this weakness, he must offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 5:4) 
And no one presumes to take this high priestly honor upon himself, but only he who is called by God to do so, just as Aaron was.

(Hebrews 5:5) 
In the same way, God the Son did not appoint Himself to be the High Priest, nor did He glorify Himself in this role. Rather, it was God the Father who spoke to Him, declaring: 'You are My Son, and today I have begotten You.'

(Hebrews 5:6) 
Just as He also says in another passage: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 5:7) 
During His time on Earth as a man, God the Son offered up prayers and urgent appeals, with fervent cries and tears, to God the Father, who had the power to save Him from the finality of death. And He was heard and received in His reverence and devotion.

(Hebrews 5:8) 
And although He was already the Son of God, He learned the full meaning and depth of obedience through the sufferings He endured.

(Hebrews 5:9) 
And being made perfect in His human nature through these sufferings, He became the ultimate source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.

(Hebrews 5:10) 
Thus, He was appointed by God to be a High Priest, in the same sacred line and according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 5:11) 
Concerning this, we have much to say, but it is difficult for us to explain it to you, because you have become spiritually slow and dull of hearing.

(Hebrews 5:12) 
For even though by now, given the time that has passed, you ought to be teaching others, instead you still need someone to teach you again the basic, foundational truths of God's teachings. You have become like infants who require milk, not solid spiritual nourishment.

(Hebrews 5:13) 
For everyone who continues to subsist on milk alone is inexperienced in the deeper teachings of righteousness, because he is still a spiritual child.

(Hebrews 5:14) 
But solid spiritual food is meant for those who are mature and have achieved spiritual perfection. These are the ones who, through consistent practice and experience, have trained their spiritual faculties to discern between what is truly good and what is evil.

(Hebrews 6:6:1) 
Therefore, let us leave behind the basic, initial teachings about Christ. We should move on to a more complete and mature understanding, not laying again the foundation of repentance from spiritually dead works and foundational faith in God,

(Hebrews 6:6:2) 
This foundation includes teachings about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the final eternal judgment.

(Hebrews 6:6:3) 
And we will do this—that is, move on to maturity—if God permits us.

(Hebrews 6:6:4) 
Indeed, it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift of divine grace, and who became sharers in the Holy Spirit,

(Hebrews 6:6:5) 
and who tasted the goodness of God's revealed doctrine, and experienced the miraculous powers of the age to come—

(Hebrews 6:6:6) 
if they then fell away from the faith. It is impossible to renew them again for repentance, because by their actions, they crucify the Son of God again for themselves and hold Him up to public shame.

(Hebrews 6:6:7) 
For the land that drinks in the rain that often falls upon it, and then produces useful vegetation for those who cultivate it, receives a blessing from God.

(Hebrews 6:6:8) 
But the land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and is near to being cursed. Its ultimate end is to be burned.

(Hebrews 6:6:9) 
But concerning you, beloved ones, we are confident of better things—things that lead to salvation—even though we speak this way with warnings.

(Hebrews 6:6:10) 
For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have shown for His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and continue to minister to them.

(Hebrews 6:6:11) 
But we earnestly desire that each one of you show the same diligence and care, so that your hope may be fully realized right up to the very end.

(Hebrews 6:6:12) 
This is so that you do not become sluggish, but rather become imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises of God.

(Hebrews 6:6:13) 
For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater by whom to swear, He swore by Himself,

(Hebrews 6:6:14) 
saying, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your descendants."

(Hebrews 6:6:15) 
And so, by patiently enduring, Abraham received the promise.

(Hebrews 6:6:16) 
For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath serves as the final confirmation for all their disputes, settling the matter.

(Hebrews 6:6:17) 
In the same way, God, desiring to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath.

(Hebrews 6:6:18) 
This was so that by two unchangeable things—namely, His promise and His oath—in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have a very strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.

(Hebrews 6:6:19) 
This hope we have as a sure and steadfast anchor for our soul, which penetrates beyond the veil into the Most Holy Place,

(Hebrews 6:6:20) 
where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:1) 
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and a priest of the Most High God, was the one who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.

(Hebrews 7:7:2) 
Abraham then gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name, 'Melchizedek,' is interpreted as 'King of Righteousness.' And then, his title, 'King of Salem,' means 'King of Peace.'

(Hebrews 7:7:3) 
He is recorded as having no father, no mother, and no earthly genealogy. He has no recorded beginning of days, nor any end of life. He is thus likened to the Son of God, and in this way, he remains a priest forever.

(Hebrews 7:7:4) 
Now, consider how great this man was, for Abraham, who was himself the great patriarch, gave this Melchizedek a tenth of all the choicest spoils he had taken in battle.

(Hebrews 7:7:5) 
And truly, those priests who are descended from Levi's sons have a divine command to collect a tenth of all property from the people, according to the Law given by God. This means they collect from their own brethren, the other Israelites, even though these brethren also descended from Abraham's lineage.

(Hebrews 7:7:6) 
But Melchizedek, whose genealogy is not counted among the Levites, received tithes from Abraham. And this priest, who had the divine promises bestowed upon him, then blessed Abraham.

(Hebrews 7:7:7) 
Now, it is beyond any dispute and universally acknowledged that the person who is of a lesser status is always blessed by the person who is of a greater status.

(Hebrews 7:7:8) 
In the case of the Levitical priesthood, tithes are collected by mere mortal men, who are destined to die. But in the case of Melchizedek, the Scripture attests that he lives, and his priesthood has no end.

(Hebrews 7:7:9) 
And it could even be said, in a symbolic sense, that through Abraham, even Levi—who later became the ancestor of the very priests who collect tithes—was himself tithed by Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:10) 
For Levi was still present in the loins of his ancestor, Abraham, when Melchizedek met Abraham and received the tithes.

(Hebrews 7:7:11) 
Therefore, if spiritual perfection could have been achieved through the Levitical priesthood, what further need was there for God to raise up another priest, one described as being 'according to the order of Melchizedek'? And why would he not be called 'according to the order of Aaron'?

(Hebrews 7:7:12) 
For when there is a change in the established priesthood, it is necessary that a change in the entire Law also takes place.

(Hebrews 7:7:13) 
For the one about whom these things are said, that is, Christ, belongs to a completely different tribe of Israel, one from which no one has ever served as a priest at the altar of God.

(Hebrews 7:7:14) 
For it is perfectly clear and well-known that our Lord Jesus Christ was born from the tribe of Judah, and regarding this tribe, Moses said nothing at all concerning their right to have priests.

(Hebrews 7:7:15) 
And it becomes even more abundantly clear that this new priesthood is necessary if another priest arises, one who is specifically 'according to the likeness of Melchizedek'.

(Hebrews 7:7:16) 
This new priest has become such, not by virtue of a merely human, fleshly law, like the Levitical priests, but by the indestructible power of an unending life.

(Hebrews 7:7:17) 
For indeed, the Scripture bears witness, saying to the Son of God: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 7:7:18) 
Thus, the former commandment, which established the Levitical priesthood, is set aside and invalidated. This is done because that old commandment was weak and ultimately useless to bring about salvation.

(Hebrews 7:7:19) 
For the Law, in itself, could not make anyone perfectly righteous or fully reconcile them with God. But now, through the New Covenant, we have been given the introduction of a far better hope, and by this hope, we are able to draw near to God with confidence.

(Hebrews 7:7:20) 
This new High Priesthood was not established without a solemn oath from God Himself.

(Hebrews 7:7:21) 
For the Levitical priests were made priests without any oath from God, but our High Priest, Christ, was made priest with an oath directly from God, as God Himself declared to Him: 'The Lord has sworn an unbreakable oath and will not change His mind: "You are a priest forever."'

(Hebrews 7:7:22) 
By virtue of this solemn divine oath, Jesus has become the very guarantee and surety of a vastly superior covenant between God and man.

(Hebrews 7:7:23) 
The Levitical priests became numerous, one after another, precisely because they were all mortal and were prevented by death from remaining in their office permanently.

(Hebrews 7:7:24) 
But Jesus, because He lives and remains in His priesthood forever, possesses an unchangeable, permanent, and continuous priesthood.

(Hebrews 7:7:25) 
Therefore, He is also perfectly able to save for all eternity those who approach God the Father through Him, Jesus Christ. He is always living in heaven for the specific purpose of interceding before the Father on our behalf.

(Hebrews 7:7:26) 
For indeed, such a high priest was perfectly suited and necessary for us: one who is holy, innocent, and completely undefiled by sin, one who is set apart from sinners, and who has been exalted to a position higher than all the created skies and celestial realms.

(Hebrews 7:7:27) 
He has no need, as the Old Covenant priests did daily, to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and only then for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 7:7:28) 
For Christ accomplished this definitive act of atonement once and for all when He offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 8:1) 
The main point of everything we are saying is this: We have such a High Priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens —meaning He is in charge of all things,

(Hebrews 8:2) 
and He serves in the true holy places, in the true tabernacle —the actual dwelling place of God, which the Lord Himself established, not any human being.

(Hebrews 8:3) 
For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for Christ, our High Priest, to also have something to offer.

(Hebrews 8:4) 
If He were on Earth, He wouldn't even be a priest at all, because there are already priests who offer gifts according to the Law of Moses.

(Hebrews 8:5) 
These earthly priests serve only as a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities. This is just as God instructed Moses when he was about to build the earthly tabernacle: He said, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain” —referring to the divine blueprint God gave Moses.

(Hebrews 8:6) 
But now, Christ has obtained a much more excellent ministry, because He is the Mediator of a better covenant —a new agreement between God and humanity, which has been legally established on better promises.

(Hebrews 8:7) 
For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no reason to seek a second one.

(Hebrews 8:8) 
For God Himself found fault with them, saying through the prophet Jeremiah: “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;

(Hebrews 8:9) 
It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not remain faithful to My covenant, and so I turned away from them, declares the Lord.

(Hebrews 8:10) 
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

(Hebrews 8:11) 
And no one will have to teach his neighbor, or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because all of them will know Me, from the least to the greatest” —meaning all will have direct knowledge of God.

(Hebrews 8:12) 
For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”

(Hebrews 8:13) 
By speaking of a “new” covenant, God has made the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and aging is about to vanish completely.

(Hebrews 9:1) 
Indeed, the first covenant itself had its ordinances of worship, by which they would be made ritually right, and it had a sanctuary which was of this world, built on earth.

(Hebrews 9:2) 
For a tabernacle was set up, the first part. In this part were the lampstands, and the table, and the showbread. This first part is called the Holy Place.

(Hebrews 9:3) 
But behind the second veil was the second part of the tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies.

(Hebrews 9:4) 
This part contained a golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered on all sides with gold. Inside the Ark was a golden urn holding manna, and Aaron's rod which had miraculously budded, and the stone tablets on which the covenant was written.

(Hebrews 9:5) 
Above the Ark were the Cherubim of Glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. Now, it is not possible to speak in detail about each of these things.

(Hebrews 9:6) 
With all these things arranged in this way, the priests regularly entered the first part of the tabernacle. There, they performed the acts of worship and completed the sacrificial duties.

(Hebrews 9:7) 
But into the second part, the Holy of Holies, only the high priest entered, and only once a year. He never entered without blood, which he would offer for his own sins and for the sins committed by the people out of ignorance.

(Hebrews 9:8) 
By these arrangements, the Holy Spirit was indicating that the way into God's true holy presence was not yet fully opened to humanity, as long as the first, earthly tabernacle was still standing and operational.

(Hebrews 9:9) 
This earthly tabernacle is a symbol for the present time, a time in which gifts and sacrifices are still being offered that cannot, in good conscience, make the worshipper truly perfect before God.

(Hebrews 9:10) 
These rituals are only about external things: foods, drinks, various ceremonial washings, and other outward regulations for the flesh, all of which were imposed only until the time when God would establish a new, better order.

(Hebrews 9:11) 
But Christ has now come forward as the High Priest of the good things that were to come. He ministers through a tabernacle that is much greater and more perfect, one not made by human hands; that is to say, it is not part of this created world.

(Hebrews 9:12) 
He did not enter by the blood of goats or young bulls, as the earthly high priest did. Instead, He entered the true heavenly Holy of Holies once for all time, by His own precious blood, having secured eternal redemption for us.

(Hebrews 9:13) 
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ritually defiled, can make them outwardly holy for the cleansing of the flesh,

(Hebrews 9:14) 
then how much more powerfully will the blood of Christ cleanse our consciences from dead works! Christ, through the eternal Holy Spirit, offered Himself as a spotless sacrifice to God. His sacrifice purifies us so that we may truly serve the living God.

(Hebrews 9:15) 
And for this reason, Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant. His death has occurred as a ransom for the transgressions committed under the first covenant. This means that those who have been called by God can now receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.

(Hebrews 9:16) 
For where there is a testament—a will—it is absolutely necessary that the death of the one who made the will, the testator, has occurred for it to be valid.

(Hebrews 9:17) 
A will is only confirmed and becomes legally binding once the person who made it has died. Otherwise, it is not yet valid as long as the testator is still alive.

(Hebrews 9:18) 
This is why even the first covenant was not dedicated and made official without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:19) 
For after Moses had read every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, mixed it with water, and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle the book of the Law itself and all the people.

(Hebrews 9:20) 
He declared, 'This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you, marking His solemn agreement with you.'

(Hebrews 9:21) 
In the same way, Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels used for its service with blood.

(Hebrews 9:22) 
Indeed, according to the Law, almost everything is cleansed with blood, and there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:23) 
Therefore, it was necessary for the earthly copies of the heavenly realities to be cleansed with these kinds of animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly realities themselves had to be purified with far better sacrifices than these.

(Hebrews 9:24) 
For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by human hands, which is merely a copy of the true one. Instead, He entered into the universe itself, the true dwelling place of God, to appear now directly before the face of God on our behalf.

(Hebrews 9:25) 
Nor did Christ need to offer Himself repeatedly, as the earthly high priest enters the Holy of Holies year after year with blood that is not his own.

(Hebrews 9:26) 
If that were the case, then He would have had to suffer many times since the very beginning of the world. But instead, He has appeared only once, at the culmination of all ages, to put an end to sin definitively through His own sacrifice.

(Hebrews 9:27) 
And just as it is appointed for all human beings to die once, and after that comes the judgment,

(Hebrews 9:28) 
so also Christ was offered once to bear away the sins of many people. He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring full salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

(Hebrews 10:1) 
The Law of Moses was only a shadow of the good things that were to come, not the real and perfect substance of those things. Because of this, it could never make perfect those who constantly approached God through the same animal sacrifices offered year after year.

(Hebrews 10:2) 
If those sacrifices could have made people perfect, they would have stopped being offered. Because then, those who had been truly cleansed through that worship would no longer have been conscious of their sins.

(Hebrews 10:3) 
Instead, those sacrifices served as a reminder of sins every single year.

(Hebrews 10:4) 
This is because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to actually take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:5) 
This is why, when Jesus Christ came into the world, He said: 'You, O God, did not want the animal sacrifices and grain offerings from the Old Covenant. Instead, you specifically prepared a human body for me to offer.'

(Hebrews 10:6) 
'You were not pleased with the burnt offerings and sin offerings, because they could not truly remove sin.'

(Hebrews 10:7) 
'Then I, Jesus Christ, said: See, I have come! As it is written about Me in the scroll of the Law, I have come to do Your will, O God.'

(Hebrews 10:8) 
First, He said: 'You did not desire, nor were You pleased with, the sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings, which were offered according to the Law of Moses.'

(Hebrews 10:9) 
Then He added: 'See, I have come to do Your will, O God.' By saying this, He sets aside the old system of animal sacrifices in order to establish the new, perfect sacrifice of His own body.

(Hebrews 10:10) 
And it is by this specific will of God, fully accomplished by Jesus Christ, that we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.

(Hebrews 10:11) 
Indeed, every Old Covenant priest stands day after day performing his duties, repeatedly offering the same sacrifices, none of which can ever truly take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:12) 
But Jesus Christ, having offered one single sacrifice for sins that is perfect for all time, now sits forever at the right hand of God the Father in heaven.

(Hebrews 10:13) 
From that moment on, He waits until all His enemies are utterly subjected to Him, like a footstool under His feet.

(Hebrews 10:14) 
For by that one offering, He has permanently perfected and brought to their full spiritual end those who are being sanctified.

(Hebrews 10:15) 
The Holy Spirit Himself also confirms this truth to us; for after He (speaking through the Prophet Jeremiah) had declared:

(Hebrews 10:16) 
'This is the New Covenant I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord. 'I will put My divine laws into their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds.'

(Hebrews 10:17) 
'And I will no longer remember their sins and their lawless deeds.'

(Hebrews 10:18) 
Now, where there is this full and complete forgiveness of sins, there is no longer any need for a sacrifice for sin.

(Hebrews 10:19) 
Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, since we have confident access into the most holy presence of God, through the blood of Jesus Christ,

(Hebrews 10:20) 
through the new and living way that He opened for us. This way passes through the veil, which is to say, through His own physical body, broken on the Cross.

(Hebrews 10:21) 
And since we have Jesus Christ as our great High Priest, who presides over the spiritual house of God—the Church—

(Hebrews 10:22) 
let us draw near to God with sincere hearts, having full assurance of faith. Our hearts have been spiritually cleansed from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with the pure water of baptism.

(Hebrews 10:23) 
Let us hold firmly and without wavering to the profession of our Christian hope, because God, who has promised these things, is utterly faithful and will fulfill them.

(Hebrews 10:24) 
And let us consider how we can stir up one another to love and to good works of charity,

(Hebrews 10:25) 
not neglecting our communal gathering for worship, as some have made it their habit to do. Instead, let us encourage one another in our faith, and do this all the more as you see the Day of the Lord’s return drawing near.

(Hebrews 10:26) 
For if we deliberately and willfully continue to sin, after we have received and understood the full knowledge of the truth of Christ, then there no longer remains any other sacrifice that can atone for our sin.

(Hebrews 10:27) 
Instead, there remains only a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of an all-consuming fire that will justly devour those who oppose God.

(Hebrews 10:28) 
Anyone who rejected or nullified the Law of Moses was put to death without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.

(Hebrews 10:29) 
How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the person who has trampled underfoot the Son of God Himself? This person has treated as unholy the very blood of the New Covenant—the blood by which they were sanctified—and has grievously insulted the Holy Spirit of grace.

(Hebrews 10:30) 
For we know Him who said: 'Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay those who deserve it.' And again: 'The Lord will indeed judge His own people.'

(Hebrews 10:31) 
It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who will execute perfect justice.

(Hebrews 10:32) 
Remember the early days of your conversion, after you received the spiritual light of Christ. You endured a great struggle filled with suffering and persecution.

(Hebrews 10:33) 
Sometimes you were publicly exposed to shame and persecution, made a spectacle before others. At other times, you became sympathetic companions of those who were suffering such things.

(Hebrews 10:34) 
Indeed, you showed compassion to those who were imprisoned, and you cheerfully accepted the seizure of your own possessions. This was because you knew that you yourselves possessed a far better and an eternally enduring spiritual wealth.

(Hebrews 10:35) 
So then, do not throw away your courageous confidence in Christ, which is accompanied by a great and lasting reward.

(Hebrews 10:36) 
For you need to persevere with steadfast patience. Only by faithfully doing the will of God will you receive the fulfillment of His promises.

(Hebrews 10:37) 
For 'in a very little while now, He who is coming will come, and He will not delay!'

(Hebrews 10:38) 
'Now, my righteous one will live by faith.' But the Scripture also warns: 'If anyone shrinks back from this faith, My soul—God Himself—will take no pleasure in him.'

(Hebrews 10:39) 
But we are not those who shrink back from faith and are destined for perdition and eternal loss. Instead, we are those who hold fast to faith, leading to the preservation and eternal salvation of our souls.

(Hebrews 11:1) 
Now, faith is the actual, underlying reality of all that we hope for;
it is the conviction and proof of things we cannot yet see.

(Hebrews 11:2) 
For through this kind of faith, the holy people of ancient times received God's full approval.

(Hebrews 11:3) 
By faith we understand that the entire universe was perfectly ordered and made by God the Son’s spoken Word,
so that everything we can see was made from things that are invisible.

(Hebrews 11:4) 
By faith, Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice to God than Cain did.
Through this faith, he received God's approval as righteous, for God Himself bore witness to his offerings.
And even though he is long dead, through his faith, he still speaks to us.

(Hebrews 11:5) 
By faith, Enoch was taken away from this world so that he would not experience death;
he could not be found, because God had taken him.
Before he was taken, he had already received God’s approval, for he had pleased God.

(Hebrews 11:6) 
But without faith, it is impossible to please God.
For anyone who wishes to draw near to God must believe that He exists,
and that He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

(Hebrews 11:7) 
By faith, Noah, after receiving a divine warning about things that were not yet visible (the coming flood),
was reverently moved and prepared an ark for the salvation of his household.
Through this act of faith, he condemned the faithless world around him
and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.

(Hebrews 11:8) 
By faith, Abraham, when he was called by God,
obeyed by going out to a place that he was later to receive as an inheritance;
he left his home not knowing where he was going, trusting only in God.

(Hebrews 11:9) 
By faith, he lived as a temporary resident in the land that had been promised to him, treating it as a foreign country.
He lived in tents, along with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs of the same divine promise.

(Hebrews 11:10) 
For Abraham was looking forward to the heavenly city that has firm foundations,
a city whose divine architect and builder is God Himself.

(Hebrews 11:11) 
By faith, even Sarah herself, though she was barren and past the age of childbearing,
received the divine power to conceive a child,
because she believed that the One who had given the promise was faithful.

(Hebrews 11:12) 
Therefore, from one man, who was as good as dead (due to his old age),
were born descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky
and as countless as the sand on the seashore.

(Hebrews 11:13) 
All these faithful people died in faith, without having received the full fulfillment of the promises themselves.
Instead, they saw and greeted them from afar,
and confessed that they were strangers and temporary residents on this earth.

(Hebrews 11:14) 
For those who speak in this manner plainly declare that they are seeking their true, heavenly homeland.

(Hebrews 11:15) 
And if they had indeed kept in mind the earthly country from which they departed,
they would have had plenty of opportunity to return to it.

(Hebrews 11:16) 
But as it is, they desired a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
for He has prepared a heavenly city for them.

(Hebrews 11:17) 
By faith, Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him.
He, who had received the divine promises, was willing to offer his only son of the promise.

(Hebrews 11:18) 
It was about Isaac that God had said, 'It is through Isaac that your lineage of promised descendants will be named and established'.

(Hebrews 11:19) 
Abraham reasoned that God was powerful enough to raise Isaac even from the dead.
And indeed, from that event, he received Isaac back as a symbolic representation of a greater resurrection.

(Hebrews 11:20) 
By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, speaking prophetically about their future.

(Hebrews 11:21) 
By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons.
And he worshipped God, bowing down while leaning on the top of his staff.

(Hebrews 11:22) 
By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the future departure of the children of Israel from Egypt,
and he gave specific instructions concerning his bones.

(Hebrews 11:23) 
By faith, when Moses was born, he was hidden for three months by his parents,
because they saw that he was an exceptionally beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's cruel edict to kill all male infants.

(Hebrews 11:24) 
By faith, Moses, when he had grown to adulthood, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

(Hebrews 11:25) 
choosing instead to suffer affliction with the people of God,
rather than to enjoy the fleeting and temporary pleasures of sin.

(Hebrews 11:26) 
He considered the suffering and disgrace endured for the sake of the Messiah to be far greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt,
for he was looking forward to God's eternal reward.

(Hebrews 11:27) 
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the fierce wrath of the king.
For he persevered, seeing the invisible God as clearly as if He were visible.

(Hebrews 11:28) 
By faith, he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of blood,
so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the children of Israel.

(Hebrews 11:29) 
By faith, the Israelites passed through the Red Sea as if on dry ground.
But when the Egyptians attempted to do the same, they were swallowed up and drowned.

(Hebrews 11:30) 
By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.

(Hebrews 11:31) 
By faith, Rahab, who had been a harlot, did not perish with those who disobeyed God,
because she welcomed the Israelite spies in peace.

(Hebrews 11:32) 
And what more shall I say?
For I do not have enough time to tell of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.

(Hebrews 11:33) 
Through faith, these men conquered kingdoms, administered true justice, obtained divine promises,
and stopped the mouths of lions.

(Hebrews 11:34) 
They quenched the power of fiery attacks, escaped the sharp edge of the sword,
recovered from severe illness and weakness, became valiant in battle, and routed the invading armies of foreigners.

(Hebrews 11:35) 
Women received their dead loved ones back to life through a resurrection.
But others were tortured, refusing to accept release or deliverance from their suffering,
in order that they might attain a better resurrection unto eternal life.

(Hebrews 11:36) 
Still others endured severe ridicule and painful flogging,
and even suffered chains and imprisonment.

(Hebrews 11:37) 
They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they faced extreme trials and temptations, they were put to death by the sword.
They wandered about in garments of animal skins, being destitute, persecuted, and cruelly treated.

(Hebrews 11:38) 
The world was not worthy of these faithful ones.
They wandered in deserts and mountains, and lived in dens and caves of the earth.

(Hebrews 11:39) 
And all these, though they obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not receive the full ultimate promise of God.

(Hebrews 11:40) 
This was because God had foreseen something even better for us, the New Covenant,
so that they would not be made perfect or reach their ultimate fulfillment without us.

(Hebrews 12:12:1) 
Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of Saints as witnesses surrounding us, let us put aside every burden and every sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the struggle that is set before us.

(Hebrews 12:12:2) 
Let us look to Jesus, the One who authored and perfected our faith. For the joy that was set before Him, He patiently endured the cross, despising its shame, and He now sits at the right hand of God's throne.

(Hebrews 12:12:3) 
For consider Jesus, who endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, so that you do not grow weary and lose heart in your souls.

(Hebrews 12:12:4) 
For in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood for the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:5) 
And you have forgotten the exhortation that speaks to you as God's children, saying: "My child, do not neglect the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when you are corrected by Him."

(Hebrews 12:12:6) 
For the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He scourges every child whom He accepts as His own.

(Hebrews 12:12:7) 
Endure with discipline. God is dealing with you as His true children, for what child is there whom a father does not correct and train?

(Hebrews 12:12:8) 
But if you are without discipline—which all legitimate children of God share in—then you are illegitimate and not true children.

(Hebrews 12:12:9) 
Furthermore, we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us. Should we not much more readily submit to the Father of our spirits and truly live and be saved?

(Hebrews 12:12:10) 
For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a short time, according to what they thought best. But God disciplines us for our ultimate good, so that we may partake in His divine holiness and become Saints.

(Hebrews 12:12:11) 
Now, all discipline, while it is happening, seems to bring sorrow rather than joy. But afterwards, for those who have been trained by it, it yields the most peaceful fruit of true righteousness and justice.

(Hebrews 12:12:12) 
Therefore, strengthen your drooping hands and feeble knees,

(Hebrews 12:12:13) 
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed and strengthened.

(Hebrews 12:12:14) 
Pursue peace with all people, and pursue holiness, for without holiness no one will see God.

(Hebrews 12:12:15) 
Look diligently to it that no one fails to obtain God's grace, and that no root of bitterness springs up to cause trouble, by which many are defiled and turned away from the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:16) 
See to it that no one is sexually immoral or profane, like Esau, who for a single meal sold his divine birthright as the firstborn.

(Hebrews 12:12:17) 
For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He found no opportunity for true repentance, even though he sought it diligently with tears.

(Hebrews 12:12:18) 
For you have not come to a tangible mountain, Mount Sinai, that could be touched—a mountain blazing with fire, surrounded by a whirlwind, darkness, and storm,

(Hebrews 12:12:19) 
nor to the sound of a trumpet, nor to a voice speaking words so terrifying that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them.

(Hebrews 12:12:20) 
For they could not endure the command that was given: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."

(Hebrews 12:12:21) 
So terrifying was that sight that even Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."

(Hebrews 12:12:22) 
But you have come instead to Mount Sion, to the city of the living God, which is the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

(Hebrews 12:12:23) 
and to the Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in the heavenly registry, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect,

(Hebrews 12:12:24) 
and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks a better word than the blood of Abel, which cries out for vengeance.

(Hebrews 12:12:25) 
See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if those who refused Him who spoke on Earth, the Law through Moses, did not escape punishment, how much less shall we escape if we turn away from Him who speaks to us from the heavens, Jesus Christ!

(Hebrews 12:12:26) 
His voice then shook the Earth at Sinai, but now He has promised, saying: "Yet once more, I will shake not only the Earth, but also the entire created universe."

(Hebrews 12:12:27) 
Now, this phrase "Yet once more" signifies the removal of created things that can be shaken, so that those things that cannot be shaken may remain and stand firm forever.

(Hebrews 12:12:28) 
Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable Kingdom, let us be grateful, and by this gratitude, let us serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.

(Hebrews 12:12:29) 
For our God is a consuming fire, a refining fire that purifies His Saints and destroys His enemies.

(Hebrews 13:13:1) 
Let the love of your fellow Christians remain in your hearts.

(Hebrews 13:13:2) 
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. Through this practice, some people have unknowingly given shelter to angels.

(Hebrews 13:13:3) 
Remember those who are imprisoned for their faith, as if you yourselves were chained with them. Also, remember those who are suffering, as if you yourselves were experiencing the same physical hardships.

(Hebrews 13:13:4) 
Let marriage be held in honor by all people, and let the marriage bed remain undefiled by sin. For God will certainly judge those who engage in sexual immorality and adultery.

(Hebrews 13:13:5) 
Your way of life should be free from the sin of avarice. Be content with the material blessings you currently possess. For God Himself has promised us, saying: "I will never abandon you; nor will I ever desert you."

(Hebrews 13:13:6) 
So, with firm confidence, we can proclaim: "The Lord is my unfailing helper and protector. Therefore, I will not fear anything that any human being can do to harm me."

(Hebrews 13:13:7) 
Remember your spiritual leaders, the ones who first taught you the saving Word of God. Consider carefully the outcome of their way of life, how they persevered in faith until death, and imitate their unwavering faith in God.

(Hebrews 13:13:8) 
Jesus Christ is the same divine person always. He was the same yesterday, He is the same today, and He will remain the same for all eternity.

(Hebrews 13:13:9) 
Do not allow yourselves to be led astray by various and unfamiliar doctrines. It is far better for your heart to be strengthened and established by God's grace, rather than by rules concerning foods, which have proven useless to those who meticulously observed them.

(Hebrews 13:13:10) 
We Christians have a spiritual altar, from which to eat. Those who continue to serve in the Old Covenant tabernacle rituals have no right or power to partake of this new, perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 13:13:11) 
In the Old Covenant, the blood of certain animals was brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest to atone for sin. The bodies of those very animals were then burned completely outside the camp of Israel.

(Hebrews 13:13:12) 
For this reason, Jesus Himself, in order to sanctify His people through the shedding of His own precious blood, suffered and died outside the city gate of Jerusalem.

(Hebrews 13:13:13) 
Let us, therefore, courageously go forth from the old ways and join Him outside the camp, willingly bearing the same scorn and disgrace that He endured.

(Hebrews 13:13:14) 
For we do not possess a permanent earthly city or homeland in this present world. Instead, we are earnestly seeking the heavenly city and everlasting Kingdom that is yet to come.

(Hebrews 13:13:15) 
Therefore, through Jesus Christ, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise. This sacrifice is the spiritual fruit of our lips, which confess and glorify His holy Name.

(Hebrews 13:13:16) 
Moreover, do not forget to do good works for others and to share your material possessions with those in need. For God is truly pleased and propitiated by such sacrifices of charity.

(Hebrews 13:13:17) 
Obey your spiritual leaders and humbly submit to their authority. For they diligently watch over your immortal souls, knowing that they will one day have to give an account to God for their stewardship. Obey them so that they may carry out their duties with joy, and not with sorrowful groaning, for that would certainly not be beneficial for your spiritual welfare.

(Hebrews 13:13:18) 
Please pray for us, your spiritual guides. We are confident that we possess a good and clear conscience in all matters, as we earnestly desire to conduct ourselves honorably in every aspect of our lives.

(Hebrews 13:13:19) 
I especially implore you to pray for this specific intention: that I may be restored to your presence more quickly.

(Hebrews 13:13:20) 
Now, may God, the very source of all peace, who, through the precious blood of the eternal covenant, brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of His flock,

(Hebrews 13:13:21) 
may He perfectly equip and prepare you in every good work, enabling you to faithfully accomplish His divine will. May He accomplish within you, through Jesus Christ, that which is truly pleasing in His sight. To this same Jesus Christ be all glory and honor, for all ages, forever and ever. Amen.

(Hebrews 13:13:22) 
Now, brothers and sisters, I earnestly ask you to patiently receive this message of consolation and encouragement. For, indeed, I have written to you in a relatively brief manner.

(Hebrews 13:13:23) 
Understand that our brother Timothy has been released from his confinement. If he arrives quickly, I plan to visit you along with him.

(Hebrews 13:13:24) 
Extend my greetings to all your spiritual leaders, and to all the holy people in your community. The Christian believers here in Italy also send their greetings to you.

(Hebrews 13:13:25) 
May the grace of God be with all of you. Amen.

(James 1:James 1:1) 
James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, sends greetings to the twelve tribes who are scattered abroad.

(James 1:James 1:2) 
My brothers, consider it a cause for total joy when you encounter many different kinds of trials.

(James 1:James 1:3) 
This is because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance within you.

(James 1:James 1:4) 
But perseverance must do its perfect work so that you may become perfect and complete, lacking nothing spiritually.

(James 1:James 1:5) 
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all and does not reproach anyone for asking, and it will be given to him.

(James 1:James 1:6) 
But let him ask in faith, without any doubting in his mind. For whoever doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind.

(James 1:James 1:7) 
Let that man not imagine that he will receive anything from the Lord.

(James 1:James 1:8) 
A man who is double-minded is unstable in all his ways and actions.

(James 1:James 1:9) 
But let the brother of humble means glory in his true exaltation, which is God's grace.

(James 1:James 1:10) 
And let the rich man glory in his humility, because he will pass away like the flower of the field.

(James 1:James 1:11) 
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. Its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance perishes completely. So also will the rich man fade away in all his worldly endeavors.

(James 1:James 1:12) 
Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because when he has been proven to be faithful, he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love Him.

(James 1:James 1:13) 
Let no one who is tempted say that he is being tempted by God. For God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself tempts no one to do evil.

(James 1:James 1:14) 
But each person is tempted when he is dragged away and enticed by his own evil desires.

(James 1:James 1:15) 
Then, when evil desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. And when sin is fully grown, it brings forth eternal death.

(James 1:James 1:16) 
Do not be deceived, my most beloved brothers.

(James 1:James 1:17) 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of change.

(James 1:James 1:18) 
By His own will, He brought us forth by the word of truth so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creation.

(James 1:James 1:19) 
You know this, my most beloved brothers. But let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.

(James 1:James 1:20) 
For the anger of man does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

(James 1:James 1:21) 
Therefore, cast off all impurity and every overflowing remnant of malice. And humbly receive the implanted word of God, which has the power to save your souls.

(James 1:James 1:22) 
But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves with false piety.

(James 1:James 1:23) 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.

(James 1:James 1:24) 
For he observes himself, then walks away, and immediately forgets what he was like.

(James 1:James 1:25) 
But whoever looks intently into the perfect law of liberty and perseveres in it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer who acts upon it—that man will be blessed in what he does.

(James 1:James 1:26) 
If anyone thinks he is religious, yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is utterly worthless.

(James 1:James 1:27) 
Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world's sinful ways.

(James 2:2:1) 
My beloved brothers, do not act partially, nor show favoritism, as you hold to the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.

(James 2:2:2) 
For if a man wearing an expensive gold ring and splendid attire enters your gathering, and then also a poor man in filthy, worn-out clothing enters,

(James 2:2:3) 
and you focus your attention on the one wearing the splendid clothing, and you say to him, “You, sit here, in a place of honor.” But to the poor man you say, “You, stand over there,” or, “Sit down here on the floor, at my feet.”

(James 2:2:4) 
In doing so, are you not making distinctions among yourselves, and have you not become judges whose very thoughts are evil?

(James 2:2:5) 
Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in the gift of faith, and to be heirs of the Kingdom that God promised to those who love Him?

(James 2:2:6) 
But you, on the other hand, have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by their great power? And is it not they who drag you into court?

(James 2:2:7) 
Do not the rich blaspheme the holy name of God, by which you are known as Christians?

(James 2:2:8) 
If you truly fulfill the royal law, which is the supreme law found in the Scriptures: “You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself”—you are doing well.

(James 2:2:9) 
But if you show partiality to persons, you are committing a sin, and you stand condemned by the law as lawbreakers.

(James 2:2:10) 
For whoever keeps the entire law, yet stumbles in even one command, has become guilty of breaking all of it.

(James 2:2:11) 
For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not kill.” If you do not commit adultery, but you do kill, then you have become a transgressor of the entire law.

(James 2:2:12) 
Therefore, speak in this way and act in this way, understanding that you will be judged by the law that grants true freedom in Christ.

(James 2:2:13) 
For merciless judgment awaits the one who has shown no mercy. However, divine mercy triumphs over judgment itself.

(James 2:2:14) 
What good is it, my beloved brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no good works to show for it? Can that kind of empty faith save him?

(James 2:2:15) 
If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking daily food,

(James 2:2:16) 
and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and well-fed,” yet you do not give them what their bodies truly need—what good is such an empty blessing?

(James 2:2:17) 
In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have good works, is dead and worthless.

(James 2:2:18) 
But someone might say, “You have faith, and I have works.” My answer to him is: “Show me your faith, if it is without any good works to prove it; but I, for my part, will show you my faith through my good works.”

(James 2:2:19) 
You believe that there is only one God. You do well to believe this! Yet, even the demons believe that, and they tremble with fear at His power.

(James 2:2:20) 
But do you wish to know, O man of empty understanding, that faith without good works is truly dead and useless?

(James 2:2:21) 
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by his good works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?

(James 2:2:22) 
You see then that his faith was working together with his good works, and by his good works, his faith was made perfect and complete.

(James 2:2:23) 
And in this way, the Scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham believed God, and his belief was counted to him as righteousness.” And he was called “the Friend of God.”

(James 2:2:24) 
You see then that a man is justified by his good works, and not by faith alone.

(James 2:2:25) 
In the same way, was not Rahab, the harlot, also justified by her good works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different path?

(James 2:2:26) 
For just as the body without a soul is dead, so also faith without good works is dead.

(James 3:1) 
My brothers, do not be eager to become teachers among yourselves, because those who teach will be judged more strictly by God.

(James 3:2) 
For we all stumble and make mistakes in many ways. If someone never makes a mistake with their words, that person is truly a perfect man. Such a one is powerful enough to guide and control their entire body, just as a horse is led by a bridle.

(James 3:3) 
Consider how we put a bridle into a horse's mouth so that it will obey us. With that bridle, we can guide its entire body wherever we wish.

(James 3:4) 
Or consider ships, which are very large and are driven by strong winds. They are steered by a very small rudder, guided by the intention of the pilot.

(James 3:5) 
In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it makes great boasts. Just see how a tiny spark of fire can set an entire forest ablaze!

(James 3:6) 
And the tongue itself is a fire; it is a complete realm of evil. The tongue is set among our body parts, and it can corrupt the entire body. It sets on fire the entire course of our lives and our destiny, because it is ignited by Gehenna—that is, by the forces of hell.

(James 3:7) 
For every kind of wild animal, and of birds, and of serpents, and of all other creatures on land and in the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.

(James 3:8) 
But no one among humanity has the power to tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

(James 3:9) 
With the tongue, we bless God the Father. Yet with the very same tongue, we curse men who are made in the likeness of God Himself.

(James 3:10) 
From the very same mouth comes both blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right that these things should happen this way.

(James 3:11) 
Can a spring pour forth fresh water and bitter water from the same opening at the same time?

(James 3:12) 
My brothers, can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and neither can a spring produce both salty and fresh water from the same source.

(James 3:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is wise and truly understanding? Let that person show their good works by living a good life, demonstrating their actions with the gentleness that comes from true wisdom.

(James 3:14) 
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, then do not boast of your wisdom and do not lie against the truth revealed by God.

(James 3:15) 
For this kind of so-called 'wisdom' does not descend from Heaven, from God. Instead, it is earthly in its origin, unspiritual in its nature, and demonic in its source.

(James 3:16) 
For wherever you find envy and selfish ambition, there you will also find disorder and every kind of evil practice.

(James 3:17) 
But the wisdom that comes from Heaven, from God, is first of all pure. Then it is peaceable, gentle, and willing to yield to what is right. It is full of mercy and produces good fruits, showing no partiality and acting without hypocrisy.

(James 3:18) 
And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace, by those who are peacemakers.

(James 4:1) 
Where do wars and quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this: from your sinful desires, which wage war within your very bodies and souls?

(James 4:2) 
You crave things, and yet you do not have them. You would murder to get them, and you are consumed by envy, yet you still cannot obtain what you want. You quarrel and wage war, yet you do not have what you desire, because you do not ask God for it.

(James 4:3) 
You ask for things, and you do not receive them, because your intentions for asking are evil; you only ask to spend it on your disordered passions.

(James 4:4) 
You spiritually unfaithful people! Do you not know that friendship with this present age is enmity against God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of this world's ways makes himself an enemy of God.

(James 4:5) 
Or do you think that the Scripture speaks in vain when it says: The Holy Spirit who dwells within you yearns jealously for your faithfulness, seeking you solely for Himself?

(James 4:6) 
But God gives even greater grace. This is why it says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

(James 4:7) 
Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

(James 4:8) 
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you who are double-minded and divided in your loyalty.

(James 4:9) 
Be wretched, mourn, and weep over your sins. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.

(James 4:10) 
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.

(James 4:11) 
Brothers, do not speak evil of one another. Whoever speaks evil of his brother, or judges his brother, speaks evil of the Law of God and presumes to judge the Law itself.

(James 4:12) 
But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but its judge.

(James 4:13) 
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, God alone. He has the power to destroy and to save souls.

(James 4:14) 
But who are you, a mere human, to judge your neighbor?

(James 4:15) 
Now listen, you who say: “Today or tomorrow, we will go to such and such a city, and we will spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”:

(James 4:16) 
But you do not even know what tomorrow will bring, or if you will be alive.

(James 4:17) 
What is your life, after all? It is merely a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes into nothingness.

(James 4:18) 
Instead of saying, as you should: “If the Lord wills it, and if we live, we will do this or that.”

(James 4:19) 
But as it is, you boast in your arrogant plans, full of pride and presumption.

(James 4:20) 
All such boasting is evil and inspired by malice against God's Providence.

(James 4:21) 
Therefore, to anyone who knows what is good and right to do, but intentionally does not do it, for him it is a sin.

(James 5:1) 
Now listen, you rich people, and start to wail and cry out, because terrible suffering is coming upon you.

(James 5:2) 
Your accumulated wealth has rotted away, and your fine clothing has been devoured by moths.

(James 5:3) 
Your gold and silver have become corroded and worthless. That very corrosion will stand as evidence against you, and it will consume your bodies as if by fire. You have spent your time hoarding up worldly riches and storing up God's wrath for yourselves in these final days before Christ's return.

(James 5:4) 
Look! The wages of the workers who harvested your crops, wages you fraudulently withheld from them, are now crying out against you. The cries of those workers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts, the God of all armies in heaven and on earth.

(James 5:5) 
You have lived lives of opulent indulgence on earth, and you have fattened your hearts as if for a day of slaughter, oblivious to the coming judgment.

(James 5:6) 
You have condemned and even murdered the righteous, and they offered no resistance to your injustices.

(James 5:7) 
Therefore, be patient, my brothers and sisters, enduring until the Lord's return. Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the valuable produce of the earth. He endures patiently until the ground receives both the early autumn rains for planting and the late spring rains for harvest.

(James 5:8) 
You also must be patient and strengthen your resolve, because the Lord's return is drawing near.

(James 5:9) 
Do not grumble or complain against one another, my brothers and sisters, so that you yourselves will not be judged for it. Remember, the Judge is already standing at the door, ready to enter.

(James 5:10) 
My brothers and sisters, take the prophets, who spoke on behalf of the Lord, as an example of endurance through suffering and of unwavering patience.

(James 5:11) 
Indeed, we acknowledge as blessed those who have patiently endured. You have heard about the steadfast endurance of Job through his trials, and you have seen the Lord’s ultimate purpose in his story, for the Lord is full of mercy and compassion.

(James 5:12) 
But above all, my beloved brothers and sisters, do not swear oaths at all—not by the sky, nor by the earth, nor by any other created thing. Instead, let your simple affirmation be 'yes,' and your simple denial be 'no,' so that you do not fall under the judgment of God.

(James 5:13) 
Is there anyone among you who is suffering hardship or sorrow? Then that person should pray. Is there anyone who is joyful and content? Then that person should sing praises to God.

(James 5:14) 
Is anyone among you gravely ill? That person should call for the priests of the Church, and they should pray over him, anointing him with blessed oil in the Name of the Lord Our God, according to the holy Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

(James 5:15) 
And the prayer offered with sincere faith will bring healing to the sick person, and the Lord will raise him from his affliction. And if he has committed any sins, those sins will be forgiven him.

(James 5:16) 
Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed and saved. For the persistent and fervent prayer of a righteous person has tremendous power before God.

(James 5:17) 
Elijah was a human being just like us, sharing in all our human frailties. Yet he prayed with such fervent prayer that it would not rain on the earth, and indeed, it did not rain for three years and six months.

(James 5:18) 
Then he prayed once more, and the sky gave forth its rain, and the earth produced an abundant harvest of its fruit.

(James 5:19) 
My brothers and sisters, if any of you has strayed from the truth of the Catholic Faith, and someone else brings him back,

(James 5:20) 
that person should know that whoever leads a sinner to repent and turn back from his mistaken path will save that sinner's soul from eternal death and cover a multitude of sins for them both.

(1 Peter 1:1) 
Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to God's chosen ones—all those who live as spiritual exiles, scattered throughout the regions of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

(1 Peter 1:2) 
These chosen ones are known by the foreknowledge of God the Father, and they are set apart by the Holy Spirit for a life of obedience, purified by the sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied abundantly in you.

(1 Peter 1:3) 
Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of His immense mercy, He has given us new birth, so that we now live in a true and living hope, all through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

(1 Peter 1:4) 
This new birth leads to an inheritance that can never decay, spoil, or fade away—an inheritance kept safe in heaven for all of you.

(1 Peter 1:5) 
Through your faith, you are being guarded by the power of God for a salvation that is ready to be fully revealed in the last days of this age.

(1 Peter 1:6) 
Because of this hope, you will greatly rejoice, even though for a short time—if it is necessary—you may have to suffer various trials and tests.

(1 Peter 1:7) 
This happens so that the genuineness of your faith—which is far more precious than perishable gold, even gold refined by fire—may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is fully revealed.

(1 Peter 1:8) 
Even though you have never seen Him, you love Him. And even though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him. And because you believe, you rejoice with an inexpressible joy that is already filled with glory.

(1 Peter 1:9) 
You are already receiving the ultimate goal of your faith: the salvation of your souls.

(1 Peter 1:10) 
Concerning this very salvation, the prophets of old meticulously searched and diligently inquired. They were the ones who prophesied about the grace that would eventually come to you.

(1 Peter 1:11) 
They were earnestly seeking to understand what specific time or circumstances the Spirit of Christ, who was within them, was indicating. The Spirit had foretold Christ's sufferings and the glories that would follow.

(1 Peter 1:12) 
It was revealed to those prophets that they were not serving themselves, but rather serving you, when they ministered these truths. Now, these same truths have been announced to you through those who preached the Gospel to you, empowered by the Holy Spirit sent from God's heavenly domain. These are truths so profound that even the angels long to look into them.

(1 Peter 1:13) 
Therefore, prepare your minds for action by mentally girding yourselves, and be alert and self-controlled. Place your complete hope in the grace that will be brought to you at the full revelation of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 1:14) 
As truly obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the evil desires that you once had when you lived in ignorance of God's ways.

(1 Peter 1:15) 
Instead, just as the One who called you is holy, you yourselves must also be holy in all aspects of your conduct and way of life.

(1 Peter 1:16) 
For the Scripture says: 'You shall be holy, because I am holy.'

(1 Peter 1:17) 
And if you call upon Him as Father—the One who judges each person's actions impartially, without favoritism—then live your lives in reverent fear during this time of your earthly pilgrimage.

(1 Peter 1:18) 
For you know very well that you were not set free from your futile way of life, inherited from your ancestors, by anything perishable like silver or gold.

(1 Peter 1:19) 
Instead, you were set free by the precious Blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.

(1 Peter 1:20) 
He was known by God the Father before the creation of the world, but He was fully revealed in these last times for your sake.

(1 Peter 1:21) 
Through Christ, you are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory. This was done so that your faith and hope might be securely placed in God.

(1 Peter 1:22) 
Now that you have purified your souls through obedience to the truth, leading to sincere fraternal love, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.

(1 Peter 1:23) 
You have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed, through the living and eternally enduring Word of God.

(1 Peter 1:24) 
For 'All human life is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, and the flower falls away.'

(1 Peter 1:25) 
But the Word of the Lord remains forever.' This is the very Word that was proclaimed to you through the Gospel.

(1 Peter 2:1) 
Therefore, you must put away all malice, all deceit, all hypocrisy, all envy, and all forms of slander.

(1 Peter 2:2) 
Like spiritual newborns, you must truly desire the pure, unadulterated spiritual milk of God's truth, so that by it you may grow in the Lord and attain salvation.

(1 Peter 2:3) 
Do this especially if you have already experienced how good the Lord is.

(1 Peter 2:4) 
Come to Jesus, the Living Stone. He was rejected by men, yet God chose Him and honored Him greatly.

(1 Peter 2:5) 
You yourselves are also like living stones, being built into a spiritual house. This house is a holy priesthood, whose purpose is to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

(1 Peter 2:6) 
For this reason, the Scripture states: 'Behold, I am placing in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen and precious. Whoever believes in Him will never be put to shame.'

(1 Peter 2:7) 
Therefore, honor belongs to you who believe. But for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner—the most important stone.

(1 Peter 2:8) 
To unbelievers, He is a stumbling stone and a rock that causes them to fall. They stumble because they disobey the word of God by not believing in Him, and this is the purpose for which they were appointed.

(1 Peter 2:9) 
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God Himself. You are chosen so that you may proclaim the wonderful works of Him who called you out of the darkness of sin and into His marvelous light.

(1 Peter 2:10) 
In the past, you were not God's people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received God's mercy.

(1 Peter 2:11) 
Beloved, I urge you as temporary residents and sojourners in this world to abstain from fleshly desires. These desires war against your very soul.

(1 Peter 2:12) 
Maintain excellent conduct among the Gentiles. Then, even when they falsely accuse you as evildoers, they will observe your good works. In doing so, they will give glory to God when He comes to judge the world.

(1 Peter 2:13) 
Be subject to every human authority for the Lord's sake. This includes the king as the supreme authority.

(1 Peter 2:14) 
It also includes governors who are sent by the king to punish evildoers and to praise those who do good.

(1 Peter 2:15) 
For it is God's will that by doing good, you silence the ignorant accusations of foolish people.

(1 Peter 2:16) 
Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cloak to conceal evil. Instead, live as servants of God.

(1 Peter 2:17) 
Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood of believers. Fear God above all. Honor the king.

(1 Peter 2:18) 
Servants, be subject to your masters with all reverence. This applies not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are difficult or harsh.

(1 Peter 2:19) 
For this is a gracious act in the eyes of God: if, because of your devotion and conscience toward God, you endure sorrows, even when suffering unjustly.

(1 Peter 2:20) 
What glory is there if you endure a beating when you have sinned? But if you endure patiently while doing good, this is truly a gracious act in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 2:21) 
For you were called to this very purpose: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example so that you might follow in His footsteps.

(1 Peter 2:22) 
He committed no sin, and no deceit was ever found in His mouth.

(1 Peter 2:23) 
When He was reviled with insults, He did not return insults. When He suffered, He did not threaten vengeance. Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges righteously.

(1 Peter 2:24) 
He Himself carried our sins in His own body on the wood of the Cross. This was so that we, having died to the power of sin, might live for righteousness. By His wounds, you have been healed of your spiritual maladies.

(1 Peter 2:25) 
For you were like sheep who had gone astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.

(1 Peter 3:1) 
Likewise, wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if some of them are disobedient to the Gospel, you may win them over not by preaching, but by your chaste conduct, lived in proper reverence and respect for God.

(1 Peter 3:2) 
They will observe your pure, chaste, and respectful behavior.

(1 Peter 3:3) 
Your adornment should not be merely an outward display of elaborate hairstyles, or of gold jewelry, or of dressing in fashionable clothing.

(1 Peter 3:4) 
Rather, let your beauty be the hidden inner person of the heart, manifested by the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious and valuable in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 3:5) 
For this is how the holy women of old, who put their hope in God, used to adorn themselves: by being submissive to their own husbands.

(1 Peter 3:6) 
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him 'lord' as a sign of respect. You are her true spiritual daughters if you do good and are not intimidated by any kind of fear that might arise from your good actions.

(1 Peter 3:7) 
Husbands, likewise, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the female, considering her the physically weaker vessel. Also, regard them as co-heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.

(1 Peter 3:8) 
Finally, all of you should be of one mind and purpose, sympathetic to one another, loving as brothers and sisters, compassionate, humble in spirit.

(1 Peter 3:9) 
Do not return evil for evil, nor insult for insult. Instead, return a blessing; for this is why God has called you: to inherit a blessing from Him.

(1 Peter 3:10) 
For he who desires to love life and to see good days must keep his tongue from speaking evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.

(1 Peter 3:11) 
He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and actively pursue it.

(1 Peter 3:12) 
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers. But the face of the Lord is set against those who do evil.

(1 Peter 3:13) 
And who will harm you if you are zealous for what is good and eager to do it?

(1 Peter 3:14) 
But even if you suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear the threats of those who oppose you, and do not be troubled by them.

(1 Peter 3:15) 
Instead, sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always be ready to give an adequate explanation to anyone who asks you for the reason for the hope that is within you.

(1 Peter 3:16) 
But do this with gentleness and reverence, maintaining a good conscience. Then, in the very matter that they speak evil of you, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ will be shamed.

(1 Peter 3:17) 
For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is God's will, than to suffer for doing evil.

(1 Peter 3:18) 
For Christ also suffered once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but brought to life by the Holy Spirit.

(1 Peter 3:19) 
In this same Holy Spirit, He also went and proclaimed His victory to the spirits who were being held in the realm of the dead.

(1 Peter 3:20) 
These were the ones who were disobedient long ago, when God's patience waited during the days of Noah, as the ark was being built. In that ark, a few—that is, eight souls—were saved through water.

(1 Peter 3:21) 
Baptism, which is a corresponding sign to that event, now saves you as well. It is not merely the removal of dirt from the body, but rather the appeal or commitment of a good conscience to God, made possible through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 3:22) 
He is now at the right hand of God, having completely swallowed death so that we might be made heirs of eternal life. He has ascended into the created universe, to a place beyond our sight, and all angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to Him.

(1 Peter 4:1) 
Since Christ suffered for you in the flesh, you also should arm yourselves with the same mindset. This is the mindset that whoever suffers in the flesh—as Christ did—is finished with the life of sin.

(1 Peter 4:2) 
This means that for the rest of your time in this bodily life, you should no longer live according to worldly human desires, but according to the will and commandments of God.

(1 Peter 4:3) 
The time you have already spent living according to the ways of non-believers is enough. That past life was filled with excessive pleasures, sinful desires, habitual drunkenness, wild parties, public carousing, and the forbidden worship of idols.

(1 Peter 4:4) 
Because you no longer join them in that same flood of debauchery and sin, they are surprised. And because they are surprised, they speak evil of you and blaspheme God.

(1 Peter 4:5) 
But those who blaspheme you will have to give an account to the Lord. He is prepared and ready to judge all people, both those who are still alive and those who have died.

(1 Peter 4:6) 
For this very purpose, the Good News was also preached to those who are now dead in their bodies. The purpose was that even though they might be judged in their human nature by men —meaning they suffered physical death—they might still live in their spirit according to the eternal life given by God.

(1 Peter 4:7) 
Now, the culmination and end of all things is drawing near. Therefore, be clear-headed and exercise self-control, and be watchful and diligent in your prayers.

(1 Peter 4:8) 
But above all these things, maintain a fervent and constant divine charity for one another. This is because divine charity—supernatural love—covers a multitude of sins.

(1 Peter 4:9) 
Practice hospitality to one another without grumbling or complaining about the inconvenience.

(1 Peter 4:10) 
Each person, according to the specific divine gift of grace he has received, should use that grace to serve one another. Act as good and faithful stewards of God's varied and multifaceted grace.

(1 Peter 4:11) 
If anyone speaks to the community, he should speak as if delivering the very words of God Himself. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength and spiritual power that God Himself supplies. This is all so that in every action, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him alone belongs all glory and dominion for all ages and eternity. Amen.

(1 Peter 4:12) 
My dearly beloved, do not be surprised or consider it something strange when you experience the fiery trials that come to test your faith. Do not act as if something utterly new or unexpected is happening to you.

(1 Peter 4:13) 
Instead, find joy in the fact that you share in the sufferings of Christ. This is so that when His glory is finally revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding gladness and triumph.

(1 Peter 4:14) 
If you are insulted or reproached for the sake of the name of Christ, then you are truly blessed. For the Spirit of glory, which is the very Spirit of God, rests upon you and dwells within you.

(1 Peter 4:15) 
However, let none of you suffer justly as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody interfering in other people's affairs.

(1 Peter 4:16) 
But if someone suffers for being a Christian, he should not be ashamed of that name. Instead, he should glorify God because he bears that holy name.

(1 Peter 4:17) 
For the appointed time has now come for judgment to begin with the household of God—meaning, with the Church and its members. And if judgment begins first with us, what will be the ultimate end of those who do not believe and obey the Good News of God?

(1 Peter 4:18) 
And if even the righteous person is saved only with great difficulty and by God’s immense mercy, where will the ungodly and the persistent sinner find a place to stand on the Day of Judgment?

(1 Peter 4:19) 
Therefore, let those who suffer according to the providential will of God entrust and commit their souls to Him, their faithful Creator, while continuing to do good and holy works.

(1 Peter 5:1) 
Therefore, I, who am also an elder, appeal to the elders who are among you—
I am a witness of Christ’s sufferings,
and I am a sharer in the glory that will be revealed in the future.

(1 Peter 5:2) 
Shepherd the flock of God that is entrusted to you,
overseeing them not because you are forced to, but willingly, just as God desires.
Do not do it for shameful financial gain, but with eager willingness.

(1 Peter 5:3) 
Do not act as if you are domineering over the people of God,
but rather become genuine examples to the flock, from the heart.

(1 Peter 5:4) 
And when Christ, the Chief Shepherd, appears,
you will certainly receive the unfading crown of glory.

(1 Peter 5:5) 
In the same way, you younger ones, be subject to the elders.
And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility towards one another,
because God resists the proud, but He gives His grace to the humble.

(1 Peter 5:6) 
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,
so that He may exalt you when His time of visitation comes.

(1 Peter 5:7) 
Cast all your anxiety and worries upon Him,
because He cares for you personally.

(1 Peter 5:8) 
Be sober and keep watch:
because your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
seeking someone to devour.

(1 Peter 5:9) 
Resist him, standing firm in your faith,
knowing that the very same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brothers and sisters throughout the entire world.

(1 Peter 5:10) 
But the God of all grace, who has called us into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus,
after you have suffered a little while, He Himself will perfect you,
He will confirm you, He will strengthen you, and He will establish you firmly.

(1 Peter 5:11) 
To Him be glory and dominion for all ages of ages. Amen.

(1 Peter 5:12) 
Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother to you, I have written briefly,
exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you now stand firm.

(1 Peter 5:13) 
The Church, which is in Babylon (Rome), chosen together with you, sends you greetings,
and so does Mark, my spiritual son.

(1 Peter 5:14) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss, a sign of Christian fellowship.
Grace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:1) 
Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to those who have received the same precious faith that we have, which is given by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ Himself.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:2) 
May grace and peace be multiplied to you through your knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:3) 
Since God's divine power has given us everything we need for a life of virtue and holiness,
this comes through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and power.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:4) 
Through these promises, He has granted us His most great and precious gifts.
These gifts enable you to become partakers of the divine nature,
having escaped the corruption of sinful desires that exists in the world.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:5) 
For this very reason, apply all diligence and effort.
To your faith, add virtue.
To virtue, add knowledge.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:6) 
To knowledge, add self-control.
To self-control, add patience.
To patience, add godliness.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:7) 
To godliness, add brotherly love.
And to brotherly love, add the highest form of love: charity.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:8) 
For if these virtues are present in you and are growing in abundance,
they will ensure you are not idle or unfruitful in your knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:9) 
But anyone who lacks these virtues is spiritually blind and shortsighted.
They have forgotten that they were cleansed from their past sins.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:10) 
Therefore, brothers, strive all the more diligently
to confirm your calling and election by performing good works.
For if you do these things, you will never stumble into sin.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:11) 
For in this way, a rich and abundant entrance will be granted to you
into the eternal heavenly kingdom of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:12) 
Because of this, I will always be ready to remind you of these spiritual truths,
even though you already know them and are firmly established in the present truth.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:13) 
Indeed, I consider it right and proper
that as long as I am in this earthly body—my temporary dwelling—
I should stir you up by constantly reminding you of these things.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:14) 
I know that my time for laying aside this earthly body is coming quickly,
just as Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself revealed to me.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:15) 
I will also take every care and do my utmost
so that even after my death, you may often be able to recall these spiritual truths.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:16) 
We did not make known to you the power and the coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ by following cleverly invented stories or myths.
Instead, we were eyewitnesses of His glorious majesty.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:17) 
For He received honor and glory from God the Father
when a voice came to Him from the magnificent glory of God, saying:
"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:18) 
And we ourselves heard this very voice coming forth from the sky,
when we were with Him on the holy mountain during His Transfiguration.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:19) 
And we possess the prophetic word, which is now even more firm and reliable.
You do well to pay attention to it, just as to a lamp shining in a dark and obscure place.
Pay attention to it until the full light of day breaks forth, and Christ, the Morning Star, arises in your hearts.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:20) 
Know this above all else:
no prophecy in Sacred Scripture comes from a prophet’s own private interpretation.

(2 Peter 1:2 Peter 1:21) 
For prophecy was never brought forth by human will or intention.
Instead, holy men of God spoke as they were inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:1) 
However, there were also false prophets among God's people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies. They will even deny the Master, Jesus Christ, who bought them and redeemed them, thereby bringing swift and immediate destruction upon themselves.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:2) 
And many will follow their depraved ways and their licentiousness, through whom the way of truth will be slandered and blasphemed.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:3) 
And out of their greed, they will exploit you for profit with their fabricated stories. For them, judgment, decreed long ago, has not been idle; and their destined destruction does not sleep.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:4) 
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, delivering them into chains of gloom and the lowest part of the underworld to be kept for torment until the final judgment,

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:5) 
and if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, along with seven other people, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:6) 
and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by burning them to ashes, making them an example for those who would live ungodly lives in the future;

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:7) 
and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the indecent conduct and corrupt lifestyle of lawless men —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:8) 
for that righteous man, as he lived among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard —

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:9) 
then the Lord knows how to rescue the devout from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, to be tormented.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:10) 
This is especially true for those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. They are bold and arrogant, and they do not tremble when they slander glorious beings and heavenly majesties.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:11) 
Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:12) 
But these people, like unreasoning animals, are creatures of mere instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed. They slander what they do not understand, and in their own corruption, they will also perish.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:13) 
They will suffer the penalty for their wrongdoing. They consider luxurious living in broad daylight a pleasure. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:14) 
Their eyes are full of adultery and never stop sinning. They entice unstable souls, and they have hearts trained in greed. They are children of curse and deserving of divine punishment.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:15) 
They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, son of Bosor, who loved the wages of wickedness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:16) 
But he was rebuked for his transgression: a dumb beast of burden, speaking with a human voice, restrained the prophet’s madness.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:17) 
These men are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm. For them, the deepest gloom of darkness is reserved for all eternity.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:18) 
For, by uttering proud words of emptiness and vainglory, they entice, through sensual desires of the flesh and licentiousness, those who are barely escaping from those who live in error and unbelief.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:19) 
They promise them freedom, though they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by whatever a person is overcome, by that he is enslaved.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:20) 
For if, after escaping the pollutions of the world through the saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, their latter state has become worse for them than the former.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:21) 
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.

(2 Peter 2:2 Peter 2:22) 
What happened to them is described by the true proverb: 'A dog returns to its own vomit,' and, 'A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mud and filth.' 

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:1) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, I am writing this second letter to you. In both of these letters, I am stirring up your sincere minds by reminding you of important truths,

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:2) 
so that you may remember the words that the holy prophets foretold and the commandment given by our Lord and Savior through your Apostles.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:3) 
You should know this first and foremost: that in the last days, deceivers will come to mock you. They will live according to their own sinful desires and lead others into deception.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:4) 
They will say, 'Where is the promise of His coming?' They will claim that since our ancestors died, everything has continued exactly as it was from the very beginning of creation, implying that Christ will not return.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:5) 
They willfully ignore the truth that the universe existed before the Flood, and the earth was formed out of water and structured by water through the creative Word of God.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:6) 
And it was by these very waters that the world of that time was utterly destroyed by the great flood.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:7) 
But the present universe and the earth, by the same divine Word, are being preserved. They are reserved for fire on the Day of Judgment, when all ungodly people will be destroyed.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:8) 
However, beloved brothers and sisters, do not let this one thing escape your notice: that with the Lord, one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. This means that God is not limited by our human perception of time.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:9) 
The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some people consider it slowness. Instead, He is patiently waiting because of you. He does not want anyone to perish, but for all to return to repentance and be saved.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:10) 
But the Day of the Lord will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night. On that Day, the heavens—meaning the created universe—will pass away with a tremendous roar, and the basic elements of matter will be dissolved by intense heat. The earth and all its works and structures will be burned up.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:11) 
Since all these things are to be dissolved in such a way, what kind of people ought you to be in holy conduct and acts of piety, preparing yourselves for that Day?

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:12) 
You should be eagerly awaiting and hastening the coming of the Day of the Lord, the Day by which the burning universe will be dissolved, and the basic elements of all matter will melt away in the fervent heat of the fire.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:13) 
But we eagerly await a new universe and a new earth according to His promise—a creation in which perfect righteousness will permanently dwell.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:14) 
Therefore, beloved brothers and sisters, since you are awaiting these glorious things, strive diligently to be found by Him without any moral stain and blameless, living in peace.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:15) 
And consider the long-suffering patience of our Lord to be for your salvation—a truth that our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you, according to the divine wisdom given to him.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:16) 
He speaks of these matters in all his letters. Some things in his letters are difficult to understand, and these difficult passages are twisted and distorted by ignorant and unstable people, just as they distort the other Holy Scriptures, leading to their own eternal destruction.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:17) 
Therefore, beloved brothers, since you have been forewarned of these things, be on your guard so that you may not be led astray by the error of these foolish people and fall from your own steadfastness in the faith.

(2 Peter 3:2 Peter 3:18) 
Instead, grow in the grace and in the full, saving knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be all glory, both now and for the Day of eternity. Amen.

(1 John 1:1) 
The Son of God, who has always existed from the beginning, is the one we personally heard, the one we actually saw with our own eyes, the one we looked at closely, and the one we physically touched with our hands—this is the Son who is the Word of Life.

(1 John 1:2) 
And this divine life was made physically clear to us. We saw it, and we are testifying and proclaiming to you this eternal life—the very life that was eternally with God the Father and then appeared among us.

(1 John 1:3) 
What we saw and heard with our own senses, we now proclaim to you. We do this so that you may share in our spiritual fellowship, and our fellowship is truly with God the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 1:4) 
And we are writing these things to you so that you may have complete and perfect joy.

(1 John 1:5) 
And this is the essential message we heard directly from Him—from Jesus Christ—and which we now proclaim to you: God is pure light, and there is absolutely no darkness or evil within Him.

(1 John 1:6) 
If we claim to have spiritual communion with God, yet we continue to live in sin and error, then we are lying, and we are not living according to God's truth.

(1 John 1:7) 
But if we live according to God's truth—just as He Himself is in pure truth and light—then we truly have spiritual fellowship with each other, and the cleansing sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son, washes away all our sins.

(1 John 1:8) 
If we say that we have no sin, we are only deceiving ourselves, and the truth of God is not truly present within us.

(1 John 1:9) 
If we confess our sins to God, He is faithful to His promises and just in His nature. He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us completely from every unrighteous act.

(1 John 1:10) 
If we claim that we have not sinned, then we are essentially calling God a liar, and His divine message is not genuinely present in our hearts.

(1 John 2:1) 
My dear children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. But even if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is perfectly just. He intercedes for us before God.

(1 John 2:2) 
And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins—meaning His sacrifice atones for and turns away God's just wrath. This is not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world, offering salvation to all who accept it.

(1 John 2:3) 
And by this we know and are sure that we have truly come to know Him, if we keep His commandments and live according to His will.

(1 John 2:4) 
Whoever claims to know Him, yet does not keep His commandments, is a liar. The truth and the reality of faith are not in that person.

(1 John 2:5) 
But whoever keeps His word, truly in that person the love of God is perfected and brought to its full expression. And by this we know that we are abiding in Him.

(1 John 2:6) 
Whoever claims to abide in Christ ought to walk himself, living his life and conducting his affairs, just as Christ walked and lived.

(1 John 2:7) 
Beloved ones, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the very beginning of your faith. This old commandment is the Word of truth which you heard when you first believed.

(1 John 2:8) 
Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true both in Christ Himself and in you, His followers. This is because the spiritual darkness of sin and ignorance has passed away, and the true light of Christ is already shining in the world and in your hearts.

(1 John 2:9) 
Whoever says he is in the light of Christ, yet hates his brother, is in spiritual darkness even until now, despite his claim.

(1 John 2:10) 
Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling or leading others to sin in him.

(1 John 2:11) 
But whoever hates his brother is in darkness and walks blindly in darkness, and he does not know where he is going, because the spiritual darkness of hatred has blinded his eyes.

(1 John 2:12) 
I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven you through the power and authority of His Name, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 2:13) 
I write to you, fathers in faith (those spiritually mature), because you have come to know Him who is from the very beginning, the eternal God. I write to you, young men (those actively engaged in spiritual struggle), because you have overcome the Evil One, Satan.

(1 John 2:14) 
I have written to you, children (new believers), because you have come to know God the Father. I have written to you, fathers in faith, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong in your faith, and the Word of God abides deeply within you, and you have overcome the Evil One.

(1 John 2:15) 
Do not love the world, meaning the fallen and sinful system of human society that is opposed to God, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world in this way, the love of God the Father is not in him.

(1 John 2:16) 
For everything that is in the world—that is, the temptations and values of this fallen system—is the disordered desire of the flesh (sensual cravings), and the disordered desire of the eyes (covetousness and lustful looking), and the pride of life (arrogance and self-glory). These desires are not from the Father, but originate from the world.

(1 John 2:17) 
And the world, with all its fleeting glory and sinful desires, is passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains eternally, possessing true and lasting life.

(1 John 2:18) 
Dear children, it is the final hour of this present age, the time between Christ's first and second comings. And just as you heard that *the* Antichrist, the ultimate adversary of Christ, is coming, even now many antichrists—those who oppose Christ—have appeared. From this fact, we know that it is the final hour.

(1 John 2:19) 
These antichrists went out from among us, meaning they were once part of the Christian community, but they were not truly of us in genuine faith. For if they had been truly of us, they would have remained with us. But they left so that it might be made manifest and clear that they are not truly of us.

(1 John 2:20) 
But you, believers, have an anointing from the Holy One—that is, from Christ or through the Holy Spirit—and you know all necessary truths for salvation and discernment.

(1 John 2:21) 
I have not written to you as if you are ignorant of the truth, but as those who already know it. And I write because it is clear that no lie can ever come from the truth; they are fundamentally opposed.

(1 John 2:22) 
Who is the liar, if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ, the Anointed Messiah? This person is an antichrist, one who denies the Father and the Son, thereby rejecting the very nature of God and salvation.

(1 John 2:23) 
Everyone who denies the Son does not also have the Father; you cannot truly know or relate to God the Father without accepting Jesus as His Son. And whoever confesses the Son also has the Father.

(1 John 2:24) 
Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning, the foundational teachings of the faith, remain firmly established in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you also will remain in the Son and in the Father, experiencing intimate communion with the Trinity.

(1 John 2:25) 
And this is the promise which He Himself promised to us, the ultimate gift of eternal life.

(1 John 2:26) 
I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to lead you astray with false teachings.

(1 John 2:27) 
But as for you, the anointing which you received from Him (the indwelling Holy Spirit) let it remain in you. And you do not necessarily need anyone to teach you *everything* in the way of ultimate truth, but just as His anointing teaches you about all things pertaining to salvation and discernment—and this teaching is true and is not a lie—just as it has taught you, abide in Him, remaining steadfast in Christ.

(1 John 2:28) 
And now, dear children, abide in Him, remain firmly united to Christ. Do this so that when He appears in His glorious Second Coming, we may have confidence and not be put to shame or shrink away from Him at His arrival.

(1 John 2:29) 
If you know that He, God Himself, is just and righteous, then know also that everyone who practices righteousness, living in a way that aligns with God's justice, is born of Him, having received a new spiritual birth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:1) 
Consider what great love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and truly are His children! Because of this spiritual reality, the world does not understand us, because it never truly understood God the Father or His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:2) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, we are already children of God right now! Yet, it has not yet been fully revealed what our glorified state will be. But we do know this: when He—Jesus Christ—appears again in glory, we shall be made like Him, for we shall see Him as He truly is.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:3) 
And everyone who cherishes this hope in Him—in Jesus Christ and His glorious return—purifies himself, just as Christ Himself is perfectly pure.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:4) 
Everyone who commits sin also breaks God’s law, and sin, by its very nature, is a transgression of that divine law.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:5) 
And you know that Jesus Christ appeared to take away our sins, and there is absolutely no sin found in Him.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:6) 
Everyone who truly abides in Him—in Christ—does not continue to live in sin. And everyone who habitually sins has not genuinely seen Him nor truly known Him in a saving way.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:7) 
My dear children, do not let anyone deceive you about this: the one who practices righteousness and lives according to God’s law is righteous, just as Jesus Christ Himself is righteous.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:8) 
The one who habitually practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning since the very beginning of creation. It was for this specific reason that God the Son appeared: to undo and destroy the works of the devil.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:9) 
No one who has been truly born of God continually practices sin, because God's divine life, like a spiritual seed, remains within him. And such a person cannot habitually sin as a lifestyle, because he has been born of God and has a new spiritual nature.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:10) 
By this clear distinction, the children of God and the children of the devil are made evident. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not from God. And likewise, anyone who does not love his Christian brother or sister is not from God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:11) 
For this is the fundamental message that you have heard from the very beginning of your Christian faith: that we should love one another.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:12) 
Do not be like Cain, who was spiritually aligned with the evil one, and murdered his own brother. And why did he murder him? Because Cain’s own deeds were wicked, while his brother Abel’s deeds were righteous in God's sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:13) 
Therefore, do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the ungodly world hates you.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:14) 
We, the faithful, know with certainty that we have passed from spiritual death into spiritual life, because we love our Christian brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains spiritually dead.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:15) 
Everyone who hates his Christian brother or sister is, in God’s sight, a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding within himself.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:16) 
By this supreme act, we have come to understand the depth of God’s love: that He—Jesus Christ—laid down His own life for us. Therefore, we also ought to be willing to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:17) 
But if someone possesses the material resources of this world, and sees his Christian brother or sister in need, yet closes his heart and refuses to help him, how can the love of God truly abide in that person?

(1 John 3:1 John 3:18) 
My dear children, let us not love merely in word or with empty talk, but genuinely, through our actions and with sincere truth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:19) 
By this practical love, we know that we are truly from the truth, and thus we can reassure our hearts before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:20) 
Because even if our own conscience condemns us, remember that God is greater than our heart and knows all things, including our intentions and efforts, offering mercy.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:21) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confident assurance before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:22) 
And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we diligently keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:23) 
And this is His foundational commandment: that we believe in the saving name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, just as He commanded us to do.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:24) 
And the one who keeps His commandments remains in God, and God remains in him. And by this we know that God remains in us: by the Holy Spirit whom He has given to us.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:1) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, do not believe every spiritual influence or teaching you encounter, but instead discern whether these spirits and their teachings are truly from God. Many false prophets have emerged and spread throughout the world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:2) 
This is how you can recognize the true Spirit of God: every spiritual teaching that acknowledges Jesus Christ has come into the world as a fully human being, with a real body, truly originates from God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:3) 
And any spiritual teaching that denies the truth about Jesus Christ—specifically that He is truly human and truly divine—does not originate from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have been warned would come, and indeed, it is already at work in the world today.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:4) 
My dear little children, you are from God and have already defeated the spirit of the antichrist and the world's false teachings. This is because the Holy Spirit who lives within you is infinitely greater than the evil spirit who dominates this world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:5) 
Those false prophets and their teachings originate from the world itself. Therefore, their messages are worldly in nature, and the worldly people readily accept and listen to them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:6) 
We, the true apostles and teachers, are from God. Anyone who truly knows and loves God listens to and accepts our teachings. Anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is the clear way we distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:7) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, let us continually love one another, because true, self-sacrificing love originates directly from God. Every person who genuinely loves in this way has been spiritually reborn by God and truly knows Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:8) 
Anyone who does not practice this kind of love does not truly know God, for the very essence and nature of God is love itself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:9) 
In this one supreme act, the immense love of God was made manifest to us: God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, not just for a visit, but so that we might gain spiritual and eternal life through Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:10) 
Real love is found in this: it was not that we first loved God, but rather that He loved us first. And because of this profound love, He sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins, to appease His righteous anger and reconcile us to Himself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:11) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, if God has loved us with such immense love, then we, too, are obligated to love one another in the same sacrificial way.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:12) 
No human being has ever seen God with their physical eyes. However, if we consistently love one another, then God dwells within us, and His love, fully actualized and made complete, is perfected in us through our actions.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:13) 
This is how we come to know with certainty that we remain united with God, and that He remains united with us: because He has graciously given us His Holy Spirit.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:14) 
And we, the apostles, have personally seen Him and bear witness to the truth that God the Father sent His Son as the one and only Savior of the entire world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:15) 
Whoever openly declares and believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly has God dwelling within them, and they, in turn, dwell in God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:16) 
And we ourselves have come to know, through experience and faith, the profound love that God has for us. God Himself is love. Therefore, anyone who lives and remains in this true love also lives and remains in God, and God lives and remains in them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:17) 
In this way, God's love is made perfect and complete in us: we can have unwavering confidence on the Day of Judgment. This is because, as Jesus Christ is in His divine and human nature, so also are we, through Him, made to be in this world—righteous and beloved by God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:18) 
There is no room for cringing fear in divine love. Instead, perfect and mature love expels all such fear, because fear inherently involves the expectation of punishment. Anyone who still lives in this kind of fear has not yet been made perfect and complete in their understanding and practice of divine love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:19) 
Therefore, let us eagerly love God, because He first loved us with an initiating and boundless love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:20) 
If someone claims, "I love God," yet at the same time harbors hatred for his brother or sister in Christ, that person is a liar. For how can anyone truly love God, whom they have not seen, if they do not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen and interact with daily?

(1 John 4:1 John 4:21) 
And indeed, this is the explicit commandment we have received from God Himself: that whoever loves God must also love his brother or sister in Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:1) 
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Christ, has been spiritually born of God. And everyone who loves the Father, who is the source of this new birth, also loves all others who are born of Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:2) 
By this sign we know that we truly love the children of God: when we love God ourselves and obey His commandments.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:3) 
For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome or impossible to keep.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:4) 
For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world: our faith in Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:5) 
Who is it, then, who overcomes the world? It is only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly God from God.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:6) 
This is Jesus Christ, who came to us through the waters of Baptism and the shedding of His blood on the Cross. He did not come to us by water alone, but by water and blood together. And it is the Holy Spirit who bears witness that Christ is the Truth Himself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:7) 
For there are three witnesses who bear testimony in Heaven: the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And these three are one in their divine essence and nature.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:8) 
And there are three witnesses who bear testimony on earth: the Holy Spirit, the water of Baptism, and the blood of the Eucharist and His Passion. And these three also bear a unified witness.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:9) 
If we accept the testimony of men in earthly courts, the testimony of God is far greater and more authoritative. For this is God’s testimony, which is the greater, because He Himself has borne witness concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:10) 
Whoever believes in God the Son carries the testimony of God within himself, imprinted upon his soul. Whoever does not believe in God the Son makes God out to be a liar and rejects His divine truth, because he does not believe the testimony that God Himself has borne concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:11) 
And this is the central truth of that testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this eternal life is found fully in His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:12) 
Whoever possesses God the Son, through faith and grace, also possesses this eternal life. Whoever does not possess God the Son does not have this eternal life, for it can only be found in Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:13) 
I am writing these things to you so that you may know with certainty that you possess eternal life, you who believe in the Name of God the Son, which is Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:14) 
And this is the confident assurance that we have in Him, God Himself: that if we ask anything according to His divine will, He hears and grants our prayer.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:15) 
And since we know that He hears us in whatever we ask in accordance with His will, we also know that we have already been granted the petitions we have asked from Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:16) 
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to spiritual death, he should pray for him, and God will grant life to that sinner who has not sinned unto death. There is, however, a sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin. I do not say that one should pray for that kind of sin in the same way, as it requires deeper repentance.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:17) 
Every unrighteous act is a sin against God. But there is a specific type of sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:18) 
We know that everyone who has been born of God does not habitually or mortally sin, for the Son of God Himself, being truly born of God, keeps Himself free from sin, and the Evil One cannot grasp Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:19) 
We know that we are truly from God, yet the whole world around us lies under the power and influence of the Evil One.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:20) 
And we know with certainty that God the Son has come into the world, and He has given us the spiritual understanding to know the true God, so that we may truly be united with His true Son, Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the true God, and He is eternal life itself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:21) 
Little children, guard yourselves from idols and false gods. Amen.

(2 John 1:1) 
The Elder writes this letter to the chosen Lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not only I, but also all those who have come to know the truth of Christ.

(2 John 1:2) 
This is because the truth of Christ dwells in us, and will be with us eternally.

(2 John 1:3) 
May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.

(2 John 1:4) 
I rejoiced greatly when I found some of your children living according to the truth, just as we received a commandment to do from God the Father.

(2 John 1:5) 
And now I ask you, Lady, not as though I am writing a new commandment for you, but that which we have had from the very beginning: that we love one another.

(2 John 1:6) 
And this is true love: that we live according to His commandments. This is the commandment that you have heard from the beginning of your faith: that you should live by it.

(2 John 1:7) 
Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has truly come in human flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist, denying the reality of the Incarnation.

(2 John 1:8) 
Watch yourselves carefully, so that you do not lose the spiritual fruits you have worked for. Instead, remain faithful, so that you may receive a full and complete reward.

(2 John 1:9) 
Everyone who goes astray and does not remain in the true teaching of Christ does not have God with them. But whoever remains in the true doctrine of Christ, that person has both God the Father and God the Son.

(2 John 1:10) 
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this true doctrine of Christ, do not receive him into your house, nor offer him any greeting of welcome, for that would be to share in his evil work.

(2 John 1:11) 
For anyone who offers him a greeting of welcome, thereby shares in his evil works and aids his mission.

(2 John 1:12) 
Although I have many more things to write to you, I did not wish to communicate them through paper and ink. For I hope to be with you soon, and to speak to you face to face, so that our joy may be full.

(2 John 1:13) 
The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. Amen.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:1) 
The Elder writes this letter to Gaius, my dearest spiritual child, whom I love in the fullness of the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:2) 
My dearest, I always pray for your complete well-being, that you may prosper in every aspect of your life and be in good health, just as your soul prospers in grace.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:3) 
I was overjoyed when our brothers in Christ came and bore witness to the fidelity of your life to the Truth, confirming that you indeed live according to the Truth of the Gospel.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:4) 
I have no greater spiritual joy than to hear that my spiritual children are living faithfully according to the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:5) 
My dearest, you act with true fidelity in everything you do for our fellow Christians, and especially for those who are traveling missionaries.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:6) 
These very brothers have given public testimony to your selfless charity before the entire Church. You will do a good work to send them forth on their journey in a manner truly worthy of God's holy service.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:7) 
For they have gone forth on their mission for the sake of His holy Name, relying only on the faithful, accepting no material support from those who are not believers in Christ.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:8) 
Therefore, we who believe ought to provide for and welcome such faithful missionaries, so that by our support, we may become their fellow laborers in the mission of the Truth.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:9) 
I also wrote a letter to the Church there; however, Diotrephes, who loves to be the supreme authority among them, openly rejects our apostolic authority and guidance.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:10) 
Because of this open defiance, if I come to visit, I will call attention to his wicked deeds: how he spreads malicious gossip against us with his words. And not content with merely doing this, he himself refuses to welcome the faithful traveling missionaries. Furthermore, he forbids those who desire to welcome them, and even casts them out of the Church community.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:11) 
My dearest, do not imitate what is evil, but rather embrace what is truly good. He who consistently does good and acts righteously is a child of God. But he who consistently does evil and acts wrongly has not truly known God.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:12) 
Regarding Demetrius, everyone speaks well of him, and his very life itself gives testimony to the Truth. We also bear our own witness to him, and you know well that our testimony concerning him is undeniably true.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:13) 
I had many more things to communicate to you, but I chose not to commit them to writing with mere ink and pen.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:14) 
Instead, I eagerly hope to see you very soon, so that we may speak to one another face to face. May peace be with you always.

(3 John 1:3 John 1:15) 
All the faithful here send their greetings to you. Please, in turn, greet all our beloved friends in the faith there, personally by name.

(Jude 1:1) 
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, writes to those who are loved by God the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ, and called to His purpose.

(Jude 1:2) 
May mercy, peace, and divine love be abundantly multiplied to you.

(Jude 1:3) 
Beloved, I was diligently preparing to write to you about our common salvation, but I felt it was necessary to write and urge you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once and for all delivered to the saints.

(Jude 1:4) 
For certain godless men have secretly slipped in among you—men long ago marked out for this condemnation—who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness, denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:5) 
Now I want to remind you, even though you once understood all these things, that the Lord, after saving His people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those who did not believe.

(Jude 1:6) 
And the angels who did not keep their proper domain but abandoned their own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.

(Jude 1:7) 
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, in a similar manner, indulged in gross sexual immorality and went after unnatural lust, they serve as an example, undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

(Jude 1:8) 
Likewise, these dreamers—the false teachers—defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the divine majesty of God and His angels.

(Jude 1:9) 
Yet Archangel Michael, when contending with the devil and disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce a reviling judgment against him, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

(Jude 1:10) 
But these men blaspheme all that they do not understand, and what they know instinctively by natural instinct, like unreasoning animals, these things only corrupt them.

(Jude 1:11) 
Woe to them! For they have walked in the path of Cain, and for profit they have plunged headlong into the error of Balaam, and they have perished in the rebellion of Korah.

(Jude 1:12) 
These men are hidden reefs and blemishes at your sacred love feasts, feasting with you without fear, caring only for themselves. They are like clouds without water, carried along by winds; they are autumn trees without fruit, twice dead and completely uprooted.

(Jude 1:13) 
They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; they are wandering stars for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

(Jude 1:14) 
It was also about these very men that Enoch, the seventh in line from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of His holy ones, the angels and saints, to execute judgment,"

(Jude 1:15) 
...to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of their ungodly acts which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.

(Jude 1:16) 
These men are grumblers, faultfinders, following their own evil desires. Their mouths utter arrogant boasts, and they flatter people for the sake of personal gain.

(Jude 1:17) 
But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken beforehand by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:18) 
For they used to say to you that in the last times there will be scoffers, who will walk according to their own ungodly desires.

(Jude 1:19) 
These are the ones who cause divisions and separate themselves, being merely natural men, not possessing the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:20) 
But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:21) 
Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which leads to eternal life.

(Jude 1:22) 
And for some, those who are already clearly in error, bring them to account and reprove them sharply;

(Jude 1:23) 
...but others, snatch out of the fire and save them; and on others, have mercy, but with caution, hating even the clothes that have been stained by their sinful flesh.

(Jude 1:24) 
Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless, with exceeding joy, before the presence of His glory—

(Jude 1:25) 
...to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and for all ages. Amen.

(Revelation 1:1) 
This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God the Father gave to God the Son, so that He could make known to His servants what must quickly happen. And God the Son made it known by sending His Angel to His servant John.

(Revelation 1:2) 
John bore witness to the Word of God—the Son, Jesus Christ—and to everything he saw.

(Revelation 1:3) 
Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things written in it. For the time is near for these things to unfold.

(Revelation 1:4) 
John writes to the seven churches that are in Asia. May grace and peace be with you from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Eternal Father, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.

(Revelation 1:5) 
And may grace and peace be with you from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful Witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. He loved us and washed us from our sins in His own Blood.

(Revelation 1:6) 
And He made us a kingdom of priests for God, His Father. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

(Revelation 1:7) 
Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him—even those who pierced Him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. Yes, truly, Amen.

(Revelation 1:8) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the Beginning and the End—the One who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Almighty."

(Revelation 1:9) 
I, John, your brother and companion in the tribulation, and in the kingdom, and in the patient endurance of Jesus Christ, was on the island called Patmos because of the Word of God—the Son, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.

(Revelation 1:10) 
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the sound of a trumpet.

(Revelation 1:11) 
The voice said: "Write what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches that are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."

(Revelation 1:12) 
I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.

(Revelation 1:13) 
And in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to His feet, and girded at the chest with a golden sash.

(Revelation 1:14) 
His head and His hair were white, like white wool or like snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire.

(Revelation 1:15) 
His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters—a mighty roar.

(Revelation 1:16) 
He held seven stars in His right hand. From His mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and His face shone like the sun in its full strength.

(Revelation 1:17) 
When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand upon me, saying: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last."

(Revelation 1:18) 
"I am the Living One. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys of death and of hell."

(Revelation 1:19) 
"Therefore, write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these."

(Revelation 1:20) 
"The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands is this: the seven stars are the Angels—the spiritual guardians—of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches themselves."

(Revelation 2:2:1) 
Write to the angel of the Church at Ephesus. Here are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand—the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, which are the seven Churches.

(Revelation 2:2:2) 
I know all that you do. I know your hard work and your patient endurance. And I know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who falsely claim to be apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.

(Revelation 2:2:3) 
You have also persevered patiently, and you have endured hardship for My Name’s sake without growing weary or giving up.

(Revelation 2:2:4) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: you have abandoned the fervent love you had for Me at first.

(Revelation 2:2:5) 
Remember the spiritual heights from which you have fallen. Repent and return to doing the good works you did at the beginning of your faith. If you do not repent and change your ways, I will come to you swiftly and remove your lampstand from its place, meaning your Church itself could lose its existence or purpose.

(Revelation 2:2:6) 
But I do commend you for this: you utterly hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

(Revelation 2:2:7) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will grant the right to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the paradise of My God.

(Revelation 2:2:8) 
And to the angel of the Church at Smyrna, write these words: Here are the words of the First and the Last, who was dead and now lives.

(Revelation 2:2:9) 
I know your suffering and persecution, and I know your material poverty. But you are spiritually rich. I also know the slander and blasphemies from those who claim to be Jews but are not truly God’s people. Instead, they are a synagogue of Satan.

(Revelation 2:2:10) 
Do not be afraid of any of the suffering you are about to face. Listen! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested and tried. And you will suffer for a limited period of ten days. Remain faithful and steadfast, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of eternal life.

(Revelation 2:2:11) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. The one who overcomes and remains faithful will not be harmed by the second death.

(Revelation 2:2:12) 
And to the angel of the Church at Pergamum, write these words: Here are the words of the One who has the sharp, two-edged sword.

(Revelation 2:2:13) 
I know where you live, in the very city where Satan’s throne is located. Yet, you hold fast to My Name and have not denied your faith in Me. Even in those difficult days, when Antipas, My faithful witness, was martyred among you, right there where Satan dwells.

(Revelation 2:2:14) 
Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You tolerate some among you who cling to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites into sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.

(Revelation 2:2:15) 
Similarly, you also have those who cling to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

(Revelation 2:2:16) 
Therefore, repent of these things and change your ways. Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and I will wage war against them with the sword of My mouth.

(Revelation 2:2:17) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will give some of the hidden manna to eat, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and eternal life. I will also give that person a white stone, a symbol of acquittal and honor, and on that stone, a new name will be written, which no one knows except the one who receives it, signifying a unique relationship with Me.

(Revelation 2:2:18) 
And to the angel of the Church at Thyatira, write these words: Here are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze, glowing as if refined in a furnace.

(Revelation 2:2:19) 
I know all that you do. I know your faith, your love, your service to others, and your patient endurance. Indeed, your more recent works are even greater than those you did at first.

(Revelation 2:2:20) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and through her teaching, she misleads My servants into committing sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols.

(Revelation 2:2:21) 
I gave her time to repent and change her ways, but she refuses to repent of her immoral behavior.

(Revelation 2:2:22) 
Listen! I will cast her onto a bed of suffering and sickness. And those who commit adultery with her will be plunged into intense suffering and great tribulation, unless they repent of the evil works they learned from her.

(Revelation 2:2:23) 
I will also strike her followers with death. Then all the Churches will know that I am the One who searches the innermost thoughts and desires, as well as the intentions of the heart. And I will give to each one of you exactly what your works deserve.

(Revelation 2:2:24) 
But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to all who do not hold to this false teaching, and who have not learned what some call the 'deep secrets' of Satan—I tell you: I will not lay any other burden upon you.

(Revelation 2:2:25) 
Only hold firmly to the truth you already have until I come again.

(Revelation 2:2:26) 
To the one who overcomes and remains faithful to My works until the very end, I will give that person authority over the nations.

(Revelation 2:2:27) 
That person will rule them with a rod of iron, and they will be shattered like earthenware vessels.

(Revelation 2:2:28) 
—just as I Myself have received this authority from My Father. And I will also give that person the Morning Star, which is Myself, symbolizing a share in My glory and rule.

(Revelation 2:2:29) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.

(Revelation 3:3:1) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Sardis, write these words: 'These are the words of Him who possesses the seven Spirits of God—that is, the Holy Spirit in all His fullness—and the seven stars, who are the bishops of the Churches. I know all your deeds. You have the reputation among men of being spiritually alive, but in reality, you are spiritually dead.'

(Revelation 3:3:2) 
'Wake up and be watchful! And strengthen the remaining good that is still alive within you, for it is on the verge of dying completely. For I have not found your deeds to be complete or perfect in the eyes of My God.'

(Revelation 3:3:3) 
'Therefore, remember the pure teaching you received from the Apostles and how you first heard it. Hold fast to it, and repent of your spiritual slumber. If you do not wake up and remain watchful, I will come upon you suddenly, like a thief in the night, and you will not know the hour of My coming to judge you.'

(Revelation 3:3:4) 
'But there are a few people in Sardis who have not stained their garments with sin. These few will walk with Me in white robes, for they are worthy of this honor, having kept their purity.'

(Revelation 3:3:5) 
'The one who overcomes these spiritual trials will similarly be clothed in white garments, signifying their purity and victory. I will certainly not erase their name from the Book of Life, which records those who are destined for eternal salvation. And I will publicly acknowledge and declare their name before My Father and before His holy angels.'

(Revelation 3:3:6) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:7) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Philadelphia, write these words: 'These are the words of the Holy One, who is absolutely true, and who holds the key of David—the ultimate authority over the Kingdom of God, the Church. What He opens, no one can shut; and what He shuts, no one can open, for He has absolute power over all things.'

(Revelation 3:3:8) 
'I know all your deeds. Behold, I have placed before you an open door for ministry and evangelism, and no one has the power to shut it. I have done this because you possess little worldly strength, yet you have kept My word faithfully and have never denied My name.'

(Revelation 3:3:9) 
'Behold, I will deliver into your hands those from the synagogue of Satan—those who falsely claim to be true Jews, God's chosen people, but are liars. Behold, I will make them come and prostrate themselves before your feet, showing their submission to you. This will happen so that they will know that I, Jesus Christ, have truly loved you.'

(Revelation 3:3:10) 
'Because you have faithfully kept My command to endure with patience, I, in turn, will keep you safe during the coming hour of temptation—a time of severe trial which is about to come upon the entire world to test all who dwell on the earth.'

(Revelation 3:3:11) 
'Behold, I am coming soon! Hold fast to the faith and good works you possess, so that no one may take away the crown of eternal life and glory that awaits you.'

(Revelation 3:3:12) 
'The one who overcomes will I make a steadfast pillar in the eternal temple of My God, and they shall never again have to leave it. I will inscribe upon them the very name of My God, and the name of the city of My God—the New Jerusalem, which descends from the sky, from My God Himself—and also My own new name. This signifies their permanent place, their divine ownership, and their intimate communion.'

(Revelation 3:3:13) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:14) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Laodicea, write these words: 'These are the words of the Amen—that is, the Divine Truth Himself—the faithful and true witness to God's plan, who is the source and ruler of all God's creation, not a created being Himself.'

(Revelation 3:3:15) 
'I know all your deeds, and you are neither spiritually cold nor spiritually hot. Oh, how I wish you were either truly cold, openly rejecting Me, or truly hot, fervently zealous for Me!'

(Revelation 3:3:16) 
'But because you are lukewarm—neither truly cold nor truly hot—just like the nauseating, tepid water, I am about to spit you out of My mouth.'

(Revelation 3:3:17) 
'Because you boastfully declare, "I am rich and have acquired great wealth, and I am in need of nothing!"—yet you do not realize that in My sight, you are truly wretched, pitiable, spiritually poor, blind to truth, and naked of spiritual virtue.'

(Revelation 3:3:18) 
'Therefore, I advise you to come and 'buy' from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may become truly rich in faith and good works. Also, 'buy' white garments from Me, so that you may clothe yourself and cover the shameful nakedness of your sins. And 'buy' eye salve from Me, to anoint your eyes so that you may regain your spiritual sight and truly understand.'

(Revelation 3:3:19) 
'All those whom I truly love, I rebuke and discipline for their own good. Therefore, be zealous in your faith and promptly repent of your lukewarmness.'

(Revelation 3:3:20) 
'Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door to Me, I will come in to them, and I will share a meal with them in intimate communion, and they with Me.'

(Revelation 3:3:21) 
'The one who overcomes will I grant the privilege to sit with Me on My throne, sharing in My royal authority—just as I Myself overcame the world and then sat down with My Father on His throne.'

(Revelation 3:3:22) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:1) 
After these events, I looked, and behold, a door stood open in Heaven. Then I heard the first voice I had heard before—a voice like a trumpet speaking to me. It said, "Come up here! And I will show you what must happen after these things."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:2) 
Immediately, I was transported in spirit, and behold, there was a throne set in Heaven, and upon the throne, Someone was seated.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:3) 
The One seated there looked like jasper and sardine stones. And around the throne, there was a rainbow, looking like an emerald.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:4) 
Around that throne were twenty-four smaller thrones, and on these twenty-four thrones sat twenty-four elders. They were clothed in white robes, and on their heads were crowns of gold.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:5) 
From the throne came flashes of lightning, voices, and peals of thunder. And seven burning lamps were before the throne, which represent the seven Spirits of God—the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:6) 
And before the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. And in the center of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:7) 
The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like that of a man. And the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:8) 
Each of the four living creatures had six wings. They were full of eyes all around and within. They never ceased, day or night, saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, He who was, and who is, and who is to come."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:9) 
And whenever those living creatures gave glory, and honor, and blessing to the One seated on the throne—to Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever—

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:10) 
the twenty-four elders would fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, declaring:

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:11) 
"You are worthy, Our Lord and Our God, to receive glory, and honor, and power. Because You created all things, and by Your will, they existed and were created."

(Revelation 5:1) 
And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne a scroll. This scroll was written on both its inner and outer surfaces, and it was sealed with seven seals.

(Revelation 5:2) 
And I saw a mighty angel. He was proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open this scroll and break its seals?"

(Revelation 5:3) 
And no one in the universe, nor on the earth, nor in the underworld, was able to open the scroll or even to look at it.

(Revelation 5:4) 
And I began to weep profusely because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or even to examine it.

(Revelation 5:5) 
And one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah—the promised descendant of David who is the Root and source of David's royal line—He has conquered. He is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seven seals."

(Revelation 5:6) 
And I looked, and behold, in the center, between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb. This Lamb appeared as if it had been slain, bearing the marks of sacrifice. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven Spirits of God sent throughout the entire earth.

(Revelation 5:7) 
And the Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne.

(Revelation 5:8) 
And when the Lamb was about to open the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before Him. Each of them had a harp and a golden bowl full of incense; these bowls contain the prayers of the saints.

(Revelation 5:9) 
And they sang a new song, declaring, "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive the scroll and to open its seals. For you were slain, and by your precious blood, you have ransomed us for God—rescuing people from every tribe, language, nation, and people group."

(Revelation 5:10) 
You have made us into a kingdom and priests for our God, and we shall reign over the earth.

(Revelation 5:11) 
And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels encircling the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. Their number was countless—millions upon millions.

(Revelation 5:12) 
They were saying with a loud voice, "The Lamb who was slain is worthy to receive all power, and divine authority, and perfect wisdom, and immense strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!"

(Revelation 5:13) 
And I heard every creature in the entire universe—those in the sky, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea—every single one of them, saying: "To Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion forever and ever!"

(Revelation 5:14) 
And the four living creatures were saying, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down on their faces and adored Him who lives forever and ever.

(Revelation 6:1) 
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures speak with a voice like thunder, saying: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:2) 
And I looked, and behold, a white horse appeared. He who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went forth conquering, and to conquer all things.

(Revelation 6:3) 
And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:4) 
And another horse went out, a red one. It was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that people would kill one another. A great sword was also given to him.

(Revelation 6:5) 
And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come, and see.” And behold, a black horse appeared, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.

(Revelation 6:6) 
And I heard a voice, as it were, from the midst of the four living creatures, saying: “A measure of wheat will cost a denarius, and three measures of barley will cost a denarius, but do not harm the wine and the oil.”

(Revelation 6:7) 
And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:8) 
And behold, a pale horse appeared, and he who sat upon it was named Death, and the realm of the dead followed closely with him. Power was given to him over a fourth part of the earth, to kill by the sword, and by famine, and by plagues, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

(Revelation 6:9) 
And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony of faith they had always held.

(Revelation 6:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: “How long, O holy and true Lord, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who live on the earth?”

(Revelation 6:11) 
And white robes were given to each of them, and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and their brethren are complete—those who are also to be killed, just as they were.

(Revelation 6:12) 
And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal, and behold, a great earthquake happened, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the entire moon became like blood.

(Revelation 6:13) 
And the stars from the sky fell upon the earth, just as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.

(Revelation 6:14) 
And the sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

(Revelation 6:15) 
And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the military commanders, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave and every free person hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

(Revelation 6:16) 
And they said to the mountains and to the rocks: “Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.”

(Revelation 6:17) 
For the great day of their wrath has come, and who will be able to stand against it?”

(Revelation 7:7:1) 
After these visions, I saw four Angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.

(Revelation 7:7:2) 
Then I saw another Angel coming up from the direction of the rising sun. This Angel had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four Angels who had been given the power to harm the earth and the sea.

(Revelation 7:7:3) 
He told them: "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God."

(Revelation 7:7:4) 
And I heard the total number of those who were sealed: 144,000 people were sealed, from every tribe of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 7:7:5) 
From the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Gad, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:6) 
From the tribe of Asher, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:7) 
From the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Levi, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Issachar, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:8) 
From the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:9) 
After these things, I saw a great multitude that no one could count. They came from every nation, and from all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They were standing before the throne of God and in the presence of the Lamb of God, clothed in shining white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.

(Revelation 7:7:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation comes from our God, who sits upon the throne, and from the Lamb!"

(Revelation 7:7:11) 
And all the Angels were standing around the throne, and around the Elders, and the four living creatures. They all fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God.

(Revelation 7:7:12) 
saying: "Amen! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, and power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"

(Revelation 7:7:13) 
Then one of the Elders spoke to me, asking: "Who are these people who are clothed in shining white robes? And where did they come from?"

(Revelation 7:7:14) 
And I said to him: "My Lord, you are the one who knows." And he said to me: "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white by the blood of the Lamb."

(Revelation 7:7:15) 
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple. And the One who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle of protection over them.

(Revelation 7:7:16) 
They will never be hungry again, and they will never be thirsty again. Neither will the sun beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.

(Revelation 7:7:17) 
For the Lamb, who is at the very center of the throne, will be their Shepherd. He will lead them to the springs of the waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

(Revelation 8:8:1) 
And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was a solemn silence in the spiritual realm of heaven, lasting for about half an hour.

(Revelation 8:8:2) 
I then saw seven angels standing before the very presence of God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

(Revelation 8:8:3) 
Another angel then came and stood before the heavenly altar, holding a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it along with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that stands before God’s throne.

(Revelation 8:8:4) 
And the smoke of the incense, carrying the prayers of God's holy people, ascended from the angel's hand into the presence of God.

(Revelation 8:8:5) 
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw the fire down onto the earth. At once, there were great peals of thunder, roaring voices, flashes of lightning, and a mighty earthquake.

(Revelation 8:8:6) 
And the seven angels, who held the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to blow them.

(Revelation 8:8:7) 
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, which was then cast down onto the earth. As a result, one-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was completely consumed by fire.

(Revelation 8:8:8) 
Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a massive mountain, blazing with fire, was hurled into the sea. One-third of the sea then turned into blood.

(Revelation 8:8:9) 
One-third of all the living creatures in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships were destroyed.

(Revelation 8:8:10) 
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, burning like a blazing torch, fell from the sky. It landed upon one-third of the rivers and the springs of water.

(Revelation 8:8:11) 
The name of the star is called "Wormwood," referring to its bitter effect. And one-third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood, and many people died from drinking these waters because they had become so bitter.

(Revelation 8:8:12) 
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars. Consequently, one-third of their light was darkened, so that one-third of the day had no light, and similarly, one-third of the night was also dark.

(Revelation 8:8:13) 
I then looked and heard an eagle flying in the middle of the sky, crying out with a loud voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts of the three angels who are still about to sound their trumpets!"

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:1) 
The fifth angel then blew his trumpet. I then saw a star—a heavenly being—fall from the sky and land on the earth. This fallen star was given a key to unlock the bottomless pit of the abyss.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:2) 
He opened the bottomless pit, and a vast amount of smoke rose from the pit, like the smoke from a massive furnace. The sun and the very air itself were both darkened by this smoke that came from the pit.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:3) 
Then, from the smoke, swarms of these locust-like creatures emerged and spread across the earth. They were given a destructive power, similar to the power that earthly scorpions have when they sting.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:4) 
They were explicitly commanded not to harm any vegetation—not the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree. Their only target was to be those people who did not have the mark of God on their foreheads.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:5) 
These creatures were not allowed to kill their victims. Instead, they were permitted to inflict torment upon them for a period of five months. The pain they caused was as severe as the excruciating pain a person feels when stung by a scorpion.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:6) 
During that time of suffering, people will desperately search for death, yet they will not be able to find it. They will long to die, but death itself will evade them and keep them alive to suffer.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:7) 
The appearance of these locust-like creatures was like horses equipped for battle. On their heads, they seemed to wear something like crowns made of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:8) 
They had hair that looked like women's hair, and their teeth were as sharp and strong as the teeth of lions.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:9) 
They were protected by breastplates that seemed to be made of iron. The sound of their wings was as deafening as the noise of many chariots pulled by numerous horses charging into battle.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:10) 
These creatures possessed tails similar to those of scorpions, and their tails contained deadly stings. Their power to inflict harm on people was limited to five months.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:11) 
These creatures had a king ruling over them—the angel of the bottomless pit. In Hebrew, his name is Abaddon, which means "destruction." In Greek, his name is Apollyon, also meaning "destroyer," and in Latin, his name is Exterminans, meaning "Exterminator."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:12) 
The first "woe"—a period of intense suffering—has now concluded. But observe, two more such periods of woe are still coming after this.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:13) 
Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a single voice speaking from the four horns of the golden altar that stands before the very presence of God. This voice commanded the sixth angel, who held the trumpet, saying, "Release the four angels who are held bound at the great river Euphrates."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:14) 
So the four angels were released. They had been precisely prepared for this specific hour, day, month, and year, to carry out their mission: to kill one-third of all humankind.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:15) 
The number of the army of horsemen was an enormous two hundred million. I personally heard their exact number stated.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:16) 
And this is how I saw the horses in the vision: their riders wore breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfur-yellow. The horses' heads resembled the heads of lions, and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:17) 
It was by these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that erupted from the mouths of the horses—that one-third of all humanity was killed.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:18) 
Indeed, their destructive power resides in both their mouths and their tails. Their tails are like venomous serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:19) 
Indeed, their tails are like serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these serpent-like tails that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:20) 
Despite these devastating plagues, the rest of humanity who were not killed still did not repent of the evil deeds they had done with their own hands. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—lifeless objects that can neither see, hear, nor walk.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:21) 
They did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries and use of poisons, nor of their sexual immoralities, nor of their thefts.

(Revelation 10:1) 
Then I saw another powerful angel descending from the sky, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.

(Revelation 10:2) 
In his hand, he held an open scroll. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.

(Revelation 10:3) 
And he cried out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he had cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

(Revelation 10:4) 
And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices, I was about to write them down. But I heard a voice from the sky telling me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; do not write them."

(Revelation 10:5) 
Then the angel whom I saw standing over the sea and over the land raised his hand to the sky.

(Revelation 10:6) 
And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the universe and all the things that are within it, and the land and all the things that are on it, and the sea and all the things that are within it: that there would be no more delay.

(Revelation 10:7) 
But in the days when the seventh angel will sound his trumpet, when he begins to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be completed, just as He announced through His servants, the prophets.

(Revelation 10:8) 
And I heard the voice from the sky speaking with me again, and it said, "Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing over the sea and over the land."

(Revelation 10:9) 
So I went to the angel, asking him to give me the scroll. And he said to me, "Take it, and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be as sweet as honey."

(Revelation 10:10) 
And I took the scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. And in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.

(Revelation 10:11) 
And the angel said to me, "You must prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:1) 
And I was given a measuring rod, much like a staff, with a voice saying: "Rise up, and measure God's true Temple, and the Altar, and those who genuinely worship within it."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:2) 
But the outer court, the part of the Temple that is outside, do not measure that; instead, leave it out. For it has been given over to the non-believers, who will trample upon the holy city for forty-two months—a specific period of persecution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:3) 
And I will give great power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days—which is the same forty-two months—clothed in sackcloth as a sign of penance and mourning.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:4) 
These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing in the very presence of the Lord who rules the earth, continuously supplied with divine grace and light.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:5) 
And if anyone desires to harm them, divine judgment, like fire, will come out of their mouths and consume their enemies. Indeed, if anyone tries to harm them, they must be killed by this means of divine retribution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:6) 
These witnesses have the divine power to shut up the sky, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire—just like Moses and Elijah.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:7) 
And when they have finished their testimony and their prophetic mission, the Beast that ascends from the abyss—a demonic, anti-Christ power—will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:8) 
And their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom for its wickedness and Egypt for its oppression, the very place where their Lord was crucified, representing the world's rejection of God.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:9) 
And people from every tribe, nation, language, and Gentile group will gaze upon their unburied bodies for three and a half days, and they will not allow their bodies to be placed in tombs, denying them a dignified burial.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:10) 
And those who inhabit the earth will rejoice over their deaths and celebrate loudly. They will even send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented all those who lived on the earth with their calls to repentance and their divine judgments.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:11) 
But after the three and a half days, the very breath of life from God entered into them. And they stood upright on their feet, and tremendous fear gripped everyone who saw this miraculous resurrection.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:12) 
Then they heard a loud voice from the sky telling them, "Come up here!" And they ascended into the sky, carried up in clouds, while their enemies watched them and saw their divine vindication.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:13) 
At that very moment, a great earthquake struck, causing a tenth of the symbolic city to collapse. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors, overcome by terror, gave glory to the God who rules over the sky.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:14) 
The second judgment-woe has passed, and watch closely—the third and final judgment-woe is about to come quickly.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:15) 
And the seventh Angel blew his trumpet. Then, loud voices rang out through the universe, declaring: "The kingdom of this world has now become the eternal kingdom of Our Lord and His Anointed One, and He shall reign over all of it forever and ever!"

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:16) 
And the twenty-four elders, who were always seated before God on their thrones, fell prostrate on their faces and worshipped God, saying:

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:17) 
"We give You thanks, Lord God Almighty, Who always is, and Who always was, and Who is always to come—because You have now taken up Your tremendous power and have begun Your eternal reign."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:18) 
"The nations raged against You, but Your righteous wrath has now come. It is the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and for You to give rewards to Your servants—the prophets and the saints, and to all who revere Your Name, from the least important to the greatest. And it is time for You to utterly destroy those who corrupted the earth."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:19) 
Then the very Temple of God in the universe was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was plainly seen inside His Temple. This revelation was accompanied by flashes of lightning, loud rumblings, thunderclaps, a great earthquake, and massive hailstones falling, signifying divine presence and judgment.

(Revelation 12:1) 
Then a great sign appeared in the sky: A woman was clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars, representing the twelve Apostles and the fullness of the Church.

(Revelation 12:2) 
She was pregnant and cried out in the pain of childbirth, referring to the Virgin Mary giving birth to Christ, and the Church laboring to bring Christ to the world.

(Revelation 12:3) 
Then another sign was seen in the sky: And behold, a great red dragon appeared. It had seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven royal crowns, signifying the vast power and dominion of Satan, the Adversary.

(Revelation 12:4) 
Its tail swept down a third of the stars from the sky and cast them to the earth, representing the fallen angels who rebelled with Satan. The Dragon then stood before the Woman who was about to give birth, so that when she delivered, he might devour her Son, referencing Satan's attempts to destroy Christ.

(Revelation 12:5) 
And she gave birth to a Son, a male child, who is destined to rule all nations with an iron scepter. Her Son, Jesus Christ, was immediately caught up to God and to His throne, signifying His Ascension and divine rule.

(Revelation 12:6) 
The Woman then fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that she might be nourished there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, symbolizing the Church's period of persecution and divine protection.

(Revelation 12:7) 
And a great battle took place in the sky: Michael, the Archangel, and his angels fought against the Dragon. And the Dragon and his angels fought back.

(Revelation 12:8) 
But they were not strong enough, and their place was found no more in the heavens, as Satan and his demons were utterly defeated and cast out.

(Revelation 12:9) 
So the great Dragon was cast down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.

(Revelation 12:10) 
And I heard a loud voice in the sky saying: 'Now salvation has come, and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ! Because the accuser of our brothers, who accused them before the sight of our God day and night, has been cast down!'

(Revelation 12:11) 
And they overcame him because of the Blood of the Lamb, which is Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and because of the word of their testimony to the truth, and they did not love their lives even to the point of death, showing their ultimate fidelity.

(Revelation 12:12) 
Therefore, rejoice, O skies, and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and to the sea, for the Devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time left for his evil work!

(Revelation 12:13) 
And after the Dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he persecuted the Woman, who had given birth to the male child, redirecting his wrath against the Church.

(Revelation 12:14) 
And to the Woman were given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent, signifying God's divine protection of the Church.

(Revelation 12:15) 
And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the Woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be swept away by the current, representing various destructive forces like heresy or persecution aimed at overwhelming the Church.

(Revelation 12:16) 
But the earth helped the Woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the Dragon had cast out of his mouth, showing how divine providence often uses earthly means to protect the Church.

(Revelation 12:17) 
And the Dragon was enraged with the Woman, and he went to wage war with the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifying Satan's ongoing war against individual believers and the faithful remnant of the Church.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:1) 
And I saw a beast rise up from the depths of the sea, and this beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:2) 
The beast I saw was like a leopard in body, but its feet were like a bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The Dragon—Satan himself—gave this beast its power, its throne, and its great authority.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:3) 
One of its heads appeared to have suffered a mortal wound, as if it had been killed, but its deadly wound was healed. The entire world was astonished by this beast and followed it in wonder.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:4) 
And they worshipped the Dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast. They also worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? And who is able to wage war against it?"

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:5) 
The beast was given a mouth that spoke arrogant boasts and blasphemies against God. And it was given authority to exercise its power for forty-two months.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:6) 
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His holy name, His sacred dwelling place, and those who dwell in the spiritual realm with Him.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:7) 
It was also granted to the beast to make war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation on earth.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:8) 
All who live on the earth will worship it—everyone whose name has not been written from the very beginning of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb, who was slain for the sins of humanity.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:9) 
If anyone has ears to hear this truth, let him pay attention.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:10) 
Whoever is destined for captivity will go into captivity; and whoever is to be killed by the sword must be killed by the sword. This calls for the perseverance and the steadfast faith of God's holy people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:11) 
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke with the voice of the Dragon.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:12) 
This second beast exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it forced the earth and all its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound had been healed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:13) 
It performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from the sky to the earth in the plain sight of all people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:14) 
It deceived those who dwell on the earth through the signs it was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast. It ordered the inhabitants of the earth to make an image in honor of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:15) 
The second beast was then allowed to give life to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and could cause all who refused to worship the image of the beast to be killed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:16) 
It also forced all people, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a distinguishing mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:17) 
No one was allowed to buy or sell anything unless they had this mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing its name.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:18) 
Here is wisdom. Let anyone with true understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number. That number is six hundred sixty-six.

(Revelation 14:1) 
And I saw: and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion. With Him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.

(Revelation 14:2) 
And I heard a voice from the sky, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The voice I heard was also like harpers playing on their harps.

(Revelation 14:3) 
And they were singing what seemed to be a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn that song except those one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed and purchased from the earth.

(Revelation 14:4) 
These are those who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were purchased from among humanity as the firstfruits for God and for the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:5) 
And in their mouth no lie was found. For they are without blemish, standing before the throne of God.

(Revelation 14:6) 
And I saw another Angel flying through the middle of the sky, having an eternal Gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people.

(Revelation 14:7) 
Saying with a loud voice: 'Fear the Lord and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the sky and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.'

(Revelation 14:8) 
And another Angel followed, saying: 'Fallen, fallen is that great Babylon! She who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.'

(Revelation 14:9) 
And a third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: 'If anyone worships the Beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,'

(Revelation 14:10) 
that person will also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:11) 
And the smoke of their torments will ascend forever and ever. They have no rest day or night, those who worshipped the Beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.

(Revelation 14:12) 
Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

(Revelation 14:13) 
And I heard a voice from the sky saying to me: 'Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time forward.' The Spirit says that they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.

(Revelation 14:14) 
And I saw: and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:15) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud: 'Send Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe and withered.'

(Revelation 14:16) 
And the One who was seated on the cloud sent His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was reaped.

(Revelation 14:17) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple that is in the spiritual realm, also having a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:18) 
And another Angel came out from the altar, having authority over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: 'Send your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth's vine, for its grapes are fully ripe.'

(Revelation 14:19) 
And the Angel sent his sickle onto the earth, and harvested the vine of the earth, and threw the grapes into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

(Revelation 14:20) 
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress up to the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.

(Revelation 15:1) 
Then I saw another great and amazing sign in the heavenly realm: it was seven angels holding the seven final plagues, because in these plagues, the wrath of God is brought to its ultimate completion.

(Revelation 15:2) 
And I saw something that looked like a sea of glass, mixed with fire. Standing upon this fiery glass sea were those who had triumphed over the beast, and its image, and the number of its name. They were holding harps, given by God.

(Revelation 15:3) 
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They declared: "Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty. Your ways are just and true, O King of the ages, the Lord who reigns through all time."

(Revelation 15:4) 
"Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy and righteous. Indeed, all the nations will come and worship before Your presence, because Your righteous judgments have been made known to all."

(Revelation 15:5) 
And after these things, I looked again, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in the heavenly realm was opened.

(Revelation 15:6) 
And the seven angels came out from the temple, holding the seven plagues. They were clothed with pure and bright stone, shimmering with divine radiance, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.

(Revelation 15:7) 
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels golden bowls, filled to the brim with the wrath of God, the God who lives forever and ever, throughout all ages.

(Revelation 15:8) 
And the temple was filled with smoke, emanating from the majesty of God and from His immense power. And no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fully completed.

(Revelation 16:16:1) 
And I heard a loud voice coming from the Temple. It said to the seven angels: 'Go now, and pour out the seven bowls of God's righteous wrath upon the earth.'

(Revelation 16:16:2) 
So the first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the land. Then a painful and malignant ulcer—a festering sore—appeared on those people who had the mark of the Beast and who worshiped its image.

(Revelation 16:16:3) 
Then the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea. And the sea became like the blood of a dead person—thick and congealed. Every living creature in the sea died because of this.

(Revelation 16:16:4) 
Next, the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water. And they also turned into blood.

(Revelation 16:16:5) 
Then I heard the angel who was responsible for the waters say: 'You are just, O Lord, who exist always, and who always were holy, because You have issued these judgments.'

(Revelation 16:16:6) 
'Because they poured out the blood of Your holy ones and Your prophets, You have given them blood to drink in return. For they deserve this punishment.'

(Revelation 16:16:7) 
And I heard another voice coming from the altar, saying: 'Yes, Lord God Almighty! Your judgments are truthful and righteous!'

(Revelation 16:16:8) 
Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun. And power was given to the sun to scorch people with its intense heat and fire.

(Revelation 16:16:9) 
People were scorched by this extreme heat. Yet they cursed the Name of God—who has authority over these plagues—and they refused to repent and give Him glory.

(Revelation 16:16:10) 
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast. Immediately, its kingdom became consumed by darkness, and people bit their tongues in agonizing pain.

(Revelation 16:16:11) 
They cursed the God of the heavens because of their pains and their sores. Yet they did not repent of their wicked deeds.

(Revelation 16:16:12) 
Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great Euphrates River. And its water dried up, so that a way might be prepared for the kings who come from the rising of the sun—from the East.

(Revelation 16:16:13) 
And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

(Revelation 16:16:14) 
For these are spirits of demons, performing miraculous signs. They go out to the kings of the whole earth and the entire world, to gather them for the battle on the great Day of God Almighty.

(Revelation 16:16:15) 
Behold, I am coming unexpectedly, like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays alert and guards his spiritual garments, so that he may not walk around spiritually naked and his shame be seen by all.

(Revelation 16:16:16) 
And the demonic spirits gathered them together to the place which is called, in Hebrew, Armageddon.

(Revelation 16:16:17) 
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. And a loud voice came out of the Temple, from the throne of God, saying: 'It is finished! It has happened!'

(Revelation 16:16:18) 
And there were lightning flashes, and rumblings, and thunder, and a great earthquake—such an earthquake as has never occurred since humanity has existed on the earth, so tremendous and so great.

(Revelation 16:16:19) 
And the great city split into three parts. The cities of the nations fell into ruin. And great Babylon was remembered before God, so that He might give her the cup of the wine of His fierce, righteous wrath.

(Revelation 16:16:20) 
Every island vanished, and the mountains were no longer found.

(Revelation 16:16:21) 
And a tremendous hailstorm—with hailstones weighing as much as a talent, about one hundred pounds each—fell from the sky upon the people. Yet they cursed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.

(Revelation 17:1) 
One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot, who sits enthroned over many nations and peoples."

(Revelation 17:2) 
The kings of the earth have committed spiritual adultery with her, and those who live on the earth have become drunk and misled by the wine of her spiritual corruption.

(Revelation 17:3) 
The angel carried me away in spirit into a desolate place. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, which was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.

(Revelation 17:4) 
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of her spiritual adultery.

(Revelation 17:5) 
And upon her forehead was a name written: "A Mystery: Babylon the Great, the mother of spiritual adulteries and abominations of the earth."

(Revelation 17:6) 
And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished and filled with wonder.

(Revelation 17:7) 
And the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will tell you the hidden truth about the woman and concerning the beast that carries her, which has seven heads and ten horns."

(Revelation 17:8) 
The beast which you saw was, and is not, and will ascend from the abyss, and then go into destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast, because it was, and is not, yet is about to be present again.

(Revelation 17:9) 
Here is a profound understanding for one who possesses wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman is seated, and these also represent seven kings.

(Revelation 17:10) 
Five of these kings have fallen, one is currently reigning, and another has not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain for a short time.

(Revelation 17:11) 
And the beast that was, and is not, this very beast is also the eighth king, yet it is one of the seven, and it goes into destruction.

(Revelation 17:12) 
And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received royal power, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.

(Revelation 17:13) 
These kings share one common purpose, and they will hand over their strength and authority to the beast.

(Revelation 17:14) 
These will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because He is the Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who are with Him are the called, the chosen, and the faithful.

(Revelation 17:15) 
And he said to me: "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, they are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and languages."

(Revelation 17:16) 
And the ten horns which you saw, belonging to the beast, these kings will hate the harlot. They will make her desolate and stripped bare, they will devour her flesh, and burn her with fire.

(Revelation 17:17) 
For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His will, and to give their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.

(Revelation 17:18) 
And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which holds dominion over the kings of the earth.

(Revelation 18:1) 
And after these things, I saw another Angel descending from the sky,
who had great power.
And the entire earth was illuminated by his glorious presence.

(Revelation 18:2) 
And the Angel cried out with a strong voice, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!
She has become a dwelling place for demons,
a prison for every unclean spirit,
and a prison for every unclean and hateful bird.

(Revelation 18:3) 
This has happened because all nations have drunk of the wine of her passionate fornication.
The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,
and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.”

(Revelation 18:4) 
And I heard another voice from the sky saying:
“Come out from her, My people, all you faithful ones!
Do this so that you may not be sharers in her sins,
and so that you may not receive any of her plagues.

(Revelation 18:5) 
For her sins have reached all the way up to the sky, to the throne of God’s judgment,
and the Lord has remembered her iniquities and will act upon them.

(Revelation 18:6) 
Pay her back just as she herself has paid you, for her evil deeds.
Double her double according to her works.
In the cup which she has mixed for others, mix for her double the amount.

(Revelation 18:7) 
As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously and in pleasure,
so much give her torment and sorrow.
For in her heart she says with pride: ‘I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall see no sorrow or suffering.’

(Revelation 18:8) 
Therefore, in one single day her plagues will come upon her: death, and sorrow, and famine.
And she will be burned with fire.
This will happen because strong is the Lord God, the Almighty, who judges her.

(Revelation 18:9) 
And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived luxuriously will weep and mourn over her,
when they see the smoke of her burning destruction.

(Revelation 18:10) 
They will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
saying: “Woe, woe, that great city, Babylon, that strong city!
For in one hour your judgment has come!”

(Revelation 18:11) 
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her,
because no one will buy their merchandise any longer.

(Revelation 18:12) 
Their merchandise included gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls,
and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
and all fragrant thyme wood,
and all vessels made of ivory,
and all vessels made of precious stone, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble.

(Revelation 18:13) 
Also cinnamon, and amomum (a fragrant spice), and perfumes, and ointment, and frankincense,
and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat,
and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and carriages or chariots,
and slaves, and the very souls of men.

(Revelation 18:14) 
And the fruits your soul passionately desired have departed from you.
And all your rich and splendid things have perished from you,
and they will never, ever be found again.

(Revelation 18:15) 
The merchants of these things, who grew rich from their dealings with her,
will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
weeping and mourning.

(Revelation 18:16) 
And they will be saying: “Woe, woe, that great city,
which was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet,
and adorned with gold, and precious stone, and pearls!

(Revelation 18:17) 
For in one hour such great riches have been laid waste and brought to nothing!”
And every captain, and every passenger on ships, and sailors, and all who sail the sea,
stood far off.

(Revelation 18:18) 
And they cried out, seeing the place of her burning,
saying: “What city was ever like this great city?!”

(Revelation 18:19) 
And they threw dust upon their heads as a sign of deep mourning,
and they cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: “Woe, woe, that great city!
In her, all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth and her costly prices.
For in one single hour she has been utterly desolated!”

(Revelation 18:20) 
Rejoice over her, you inhabitants of the celestial realms, meaning angels and saints,
and you holy Apostles and Prophets!
This is because God has judged your cause against her and brought justice upon her.

(Revelation 18:21) 
And one mighty Angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone, an enormous grinding stone,
and threw it into the sea, saying: “With such violence and force shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down into oblivion,
and she shall never, ever be found again.”

(Revelation 18:22) 
And the sound of harpists, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpets will no longer be heard in you.
And no craftsman of any craft or skill will be found in you any longer.
And the sound of the millstone, for daily bread, will not be heard in you any longer.

(Revelation 18:23) 
And the light of a lamp will shine no longer in you, ending all activity.
And the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, signifying joy and new life, will not be heard in you any longer.
This judgment comes because your merchants were the great ones and rulers of the earth,
and because by your sorceries, deceptions, and spiritual manipulations, all nations were led astray into sin.

(Revelation 18:24) 
And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of all Saints,
of all who were unjustly slain on the earth through the ages.

(Revelation 19:1) 
After these events, I heard what sounded like a massive voice from countless crowds in the spiritual realm, saying: “Praise God! All salvation, all glory, and all power belong to our God.”

(Revelation 19:2) 
“Because His judgments are true and just. He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His servants from her hands.”

(Revelation 19:3) 
And again they said: “Praise God!” And the smoke of her burning ascended forever and ever.

(Revelation 19:4) 
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who was seated upon His throne, saying: “So be it! Praise God!”

(Revelation 19:5) 
And a voice came forth from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants, and you who fear Him, both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:6) 
And I heard what sounded like the voice of a great crowd, and like the sound of many rushing waters, and like the sound of mighty thunderclaps, saying: “Praise God! Because the Lord our Almighty God has begun His reign.”

(Revelation 19:7) 
“Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give glory to Him. Because the Wedding Feast of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has prepared herself for it.”

(Revelation 19:8) 
And it was granted to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.

(Revelation 19:9) 
And He said to me: “Write this down: Blessed are those who are called to the Wedding Supper of the Lamb.” And He said to me: “These words are the true words of God.”

(Revelation 19:10) 
And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me: “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God alone. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy itself.”

(Revelation 19:11) 
And then I saw the spiritual realm opened, and behold, a white horse. And the One who sat upon it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice He judges and makes war.

(Revelation 19:12) 
And His eyes were like a flame of fire, and upon His head were many diadems, and He had a name written on Him which no one knows but Himself.

(Revelation 19:13) 
And He was clothed in a vestment dipped in blood, and His name is called: “The Son of God” (The Word of God).

(Revelation 19:14) 
And the armies of the spiritual realms followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

(Revelation 19:15) 
And from His mouth proceeds a sharp, two-edged sword, that with it He may strike down the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. And He Himself treads the winepress of the furious wrath of Almighty God.

(Revelation 19:16) 
And He has written on His vestment and on His thigh: “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”

(Revelation 19:17) 
And I saw a single Angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that flew through the midst of the sky: “Come, gather yourselves together for the great Supper of God.”

(Revelation 19:18) 
“So that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of tribunes, and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sat upon them, and the flesh of all free men and of servants, and of both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:19) 
And I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat upon the horse, and against His army.

(Revelation 19:20) 
And the Beast was captured, and with it the false prophet, who had performed signs in its presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the Beast and who had worshipped its image. These two, while still alive, were cast into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.

(Revelation 19:21) 
And the rest were slain with the sword of the One who sat upon the horse, which proceeds from His mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:1) 
Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky. He was holding the key to the bottomless pit, the Abyss, and a great chain in his hand.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:2) 
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is also called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, a symbolic period of spiritual confinement.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:3) 
The angel then threw him into the Abyss, shutting it and sealing it over him. This was so the Devil could not deceive the nations and turn them away from God until the thousand years of spiritual confinement were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:4) 
Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for proclaiming Jesus and God's word, and those who had not worshipped the Beast or its image, nor received its mark on their foreheads or hands. These souls came to life and reigned with Christ for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:5) 
The rest of the spiritually dead did not come to life in this way until the thousand years were finished. This is what is meant by the first resurrection: a spiritual reawakening and reign with Christ.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:6) 
Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in this first resurrection, meaning a spiritual reign with Christ. Over these, the second death—eternal damnation in hell—has no power. Instead, they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with Him for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:7) 
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his spiritual prison. He will then go out to deceive the nations throughout the whole earth—Gog and Magog, representing all who oppose God—and gather them for a final spiritual battle. Their numbers will be as countless as the sand of the sea.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:8) 
They marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, which is the Church.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:9) 
Then fire came down from God out of the sky and consumed them all. And the Devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the False Prophet had already been cast. There they will be tormented day and night for all eternity.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:10) 
Then I saw a great white throne, and One sitting on it. Before His presence, the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:11) 
I saw all the dead, both great and small, standing before the throne. Books were opened, which contained records of their lives. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their deeds, which were written in those books.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:12) 
The sea gave up the dead that were in it. And Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) gave up their dead that were in them. Every single person was judged according to what they had done in their lives.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:13) 
And Death itself and Hades (the realm of the dead) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, which is eternal damnation.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:14) 
If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, that person was cast into the lake of fire, suffering eternal damnation.

(Revelation 21:1) 
I then saw a new universe and a new earth. The old universe and the old earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.

(Revelation 21:2) 
And I, John, saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the sky from God. It was prepared like a bride beautifully adorned for her husband.

(Revelation 21:3) 
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with humanity, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.'

(Revelation 21:4) 
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain anymore, because the former things have passed away.

(Revelation 21:5) 
And He who sat on the throne said: 'Behold, I am making all things new.' He also said to me, 'Write, for these words are utterly trustworthy and true.'

(Revelation 21:6) 
And He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end of all things. To the one who thirsts, I will give water from the fountain of life as a free gift.'

(Revelation 21:7) 
The one who overcomes will inherit these things. And I will be his God, and he will be My son.

(Revelation 21:8) 
But for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the detestable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars—their destiny will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

(Revelation 21:9) 
Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came and spoke with me, saying: 'Come, and I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.'

(Revelation 21:10) 
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending out of the sky from God.

(Revelation 21:11) 
It had the glory of God. Its radiance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.

(Revelation 21:12) 
It had a great, high wall with twelve gates. At the gates were twelve angels, and names were inscribed on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 21:13) 
There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.

(Revelation 21:14) 
The wall of the City also had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

(Revelation 21:15) 
The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the City, its gates, and its wall.

(Revelation 21:16) 
The City was laid out as a square, and its length was as great as its width. He measured the City with the golden rod, and it was twelve thousand stadia long. Its length, height, and width were all equal.

(Revelation 21:17) 
He also measured its wall, which was one hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure—this refers to the unit of measurement that angels use, not their physical size.

(Revelation 21:18) 
The wall was built of jasper, and the City itself was pure gold, clear as pure glass.

(Revelation 21:19) 
The foundations of the City wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

(Revelation 21:20) 
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

(Revelation 21:21) 
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made from a single pearl. And the main street of the City was pure gold, as transparent as glass.

(Revelation 21:22) 
I saw no temple within it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

(Revelation 21:23) 
The City has no need of the sun or the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its lamp.

(Revelation 21:24) 
The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory and honor into it.

(Revelation 21:25) 
Its gates will never be shut by day, because there will be no night there.

(Revelation 21:26) 
And they will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

(Revelation 21:27) 
Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life will enter.

(Revelation 22:2) 
In the middle of the city's main street, and on both sides of the river, stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

(Revelation 22:3) 
And there will be no more curse or damnation. Instead, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him directly.

(Revelation 22:4) 
They will see His face directly, and His name will be visibly marked on their foreheads, showing their complete belonging to Him.

(Revelation 22:5) 
And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God Himself will enlighten them, and they will reign with Him forever and ever.

(Revelation 22:6) 
And the angel said to me: "These words are most trustworthy and true. For the Lord God, who inspires the spirits of the prophets, has sent His Angel to show His servants what must soon take place."

(Revelation 22:7) 
"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who truly keeps the words of the prophecy contained in this book."

(Revelation 22:8) 
And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. After I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel who had shown me these things.

(Revelation 22:9) 
And he said to me: "Do not do that! For I am a fellow servant with you, and with your brethren the prophets, and with all those who keep the words of this book. Worship God alone, for He is the only one worthy."

(Revelation 22:10) 
And he said to me: "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time for these events is near."

(Revelation 22:11) 
"Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong still, and let him who is filthy remain filthy still. But let him who is just continue to be justified still, and let him who is holy continue to be sanctified still." This means that soon, each person's spiritual state will be fixed.

(Revelation 22:12) 
"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, so that I may render to each person according to their works."

(Revelation 22:13) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega, which means I am the First and the Last, the very Beginning and the End of all things."

(Revelation 22:14) 
Blessed are those who wash their robes in the Blood of the Lamb, so that they may have the right to eat from the tree of life and may enter into the Holy City through its gates.

(Revelation 22:15) 
Outside the Holy City are the dogs—meaning the impure and those who oppose God—along with sorcerers, the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

(Revelation 22:16) 
"I, Jesus, have sent My Angel to give you this testimony for all the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright, splendid Morning Star."

(Revelation 22:17) 
And the Holy Spirit and the Church, His Bride, say: "Come, Lord Jesus!" And let everyone who hears this also say: "Come!" Let anyone who is spiritually thirsty come, and let anyone who wills, take the water of life freely, as a gift.

(Revelation 22:18) 
For I solemnly testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone presumes to add to these revealed truths, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:19) 
And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion from the tree of life and from the Holy City, and from the blessings that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:20) 
He who gives testimony to these things, which is Jesus Himself, says: "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!

(Revelation 22:21) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
