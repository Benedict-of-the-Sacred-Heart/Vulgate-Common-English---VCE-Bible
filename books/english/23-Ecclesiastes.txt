(Ecclesiastes 1:1) 
These are the words of the Preacher, the son of David, the king of Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 1:2) 
“Meaningless, meaningless,” says the Preacher; “all things are meaningless.”

(Ecclesiastes 1:3) 
What is the benefit to any person for all his labor—labor that he does under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 1:4) 
One generation passes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains the same throughout time.

(Ecclesiastes 1:5) 
The sun rises and sets, returning to its place, and then, rising again,

(Ecclesiastes 1:6) 
it travels south, then turns north, always circling, always going back to its own circuits.

(Ecclesiastes 1:7) 
All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea does not become full. The rivers flow where they came from, so they can continue to flow.

(Ecclesiastes 1:8) 
All things are hard; no person can explain them with words.

(Ecclesiastes 1:9) 
The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear filled with hearing.

(Ecclesiastes 1:10) 
What has happened already? The same things that are going to happen again. What has been done before? The same things that will have to be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 1:11) 
If someone says, “Look, this is new!” it has already happened long ago in the ages before us.

(Ecclesiastes 1:12) 
There is no memory of what came before. Nor will those who come after remember what the first ones did, even in the very last generation.

(Ecclesiastes 1:13) 
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 1:14) 
And I set my heart to seek and examine wisely all the things that are done under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 1:15) 
God gave this bad occupation to the sons of men, so that they should be occupied with it.

(Ecclesiastes 1:16) 
I saw all the things that are done under the sun, and behold, all things are meaningless and a chasing after wind.

(Ecclesiastes 1:17) 
What is crooked cannot be made straight, and the number of fools is infinite.

(Ecclesiastes 1:18) 
I said in my heart, “I have become great, and I have increased in wisdom more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.” And my mind has contemplated much wisdom and knowledge.

(Ecclesiastes 1:19) 
I set my heart to know prudence, and also foolishness and folly: and I knew that this too was a chasing after wind,

(Ecclesiastes 1:20) 
because in much wisdom there is much anger, and he who increases knowledge, increases sorrow.

(Ecclesiastes 2:1) 
I told myself: “I will go and experience pleasure, and enjoy good things.” And I saw that this, too, was futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:2) 
I said of laughter: “It is madness!” and I said of joy: “What use is this?”

(Ecclesiastes 2:3) 
I pondered in my heart the way to cheer my body with wine, and how to sustain my mind with wisdom. I wanted to see what I should do under heaven during the few days of my life. I wanted to see what was good for humanity. I saw that this, too, was futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:4) 
I did great things: I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.

(Ecclesiastes 2:5) 
I made gardens and parks, and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:6) 
I created pools of water to irrigate the groves of young trees.

(Ecclesiastes 2:7) 
I had many servants and maids, and more possessions than anyone before me in Jerusalem.

(Ecclesiastes 2:8) 
I gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself singers and musicians, and the delights of the sons of men: many of them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:9) 
So I became great, more so than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I always kept my wisdom.

(Ecclesiastes 2:10) 
And I did not deny my eyes anything they desired. I refused to restrain my heart from any pleasure. I was glad in all my labor. This was my reward.

(Ecclesiastes 2:11) 
I turned to consider all the works that my hands had accomplished, and the labor which I had toiled at. And behold, all was vanity and affliction of mind, and no profit under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 2:12) 
I then turned to consider wisdom, and madness, and folly. For what can a man do who comes after the king? What has he done already?

(Ecclesiastes 2:13) 
I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness.

(Ecclesiastes 2:14) 
The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. But I understood that one fate comes to both of them.

(Ecclesiastes 2:15) 
Then I said in my heart, “As the fool is, so am I.” Why then have I been so very wise? I then realized this was also futility.

(Ecclesiastes 2:16) 
There is no permanent memory of the wise, and no lasting memory of the fool. In the coming days, all will be forgotten.

(Ecclesiastes 2:17) 
So I hated life, because all things done under the sun were grievous to me. For everything is vanity and an affliction of mind.

(Ecclesiastes 2:18) 
I hated all the fruit of my labor, which I had gained under the sun. I must leave it for the man who comes after me.

(Ecclesiastes 2:19) 
Who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will have control over all my labor in which I have toiled under the sun. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 2:20) 
So I began to despair of all my labor at which I had toiled under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 2:21) 
For there is a man who has labored with wisdom, and knowledge, and skill, but who must then give his portion to a man who did not labor for it. This also is vanity and great evil.

(Ecclesiastes 2:22) 
For what does a man get from all his labor and toil at which he toils under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 2:23) 
For all his days are full of grief, and his task is a source of sorrow. Even at night, his heart is not at rest. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 2:24) 
There is no good for a man but to eat, drink, and allow his soul to be happy in his labor. Then I saw that this also is from the hand of God.

(Ecclesiastes 2:25) 
Who indeed can eat, or who can rejoice, without Him?

(Ecclesiastes 2:26) 
To the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy. But to the sinner, God gives the task of gathering and collecting so that it can then be given to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and an affliction of the mind.

(Ecclesiastes 3:1) 
Everything happens at the right time, in its season, and there is a specific time for everything that happens under the sky.

(Ecclesiastes 3:2) 
There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what has been planted.

(Ecclesiastes 3:3) 
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to destroy, and a time to build up.

(Ecclesiastes 3:4) 
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.

(Ecclesiastes 3:5) 
A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.

(Ecclesiastes 3:6) 
A time to gain, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away.

(Ecclesiastes 3:7) 
A time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak.

(Ecclesiastes 3:8) 
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.

(Ecclesiastes 3:9) 
What does the worker gain from his toil?

(Ecclesiastes 3:10) 
I have seen the burden that God has given the children of men to be afflicted in it.

(Ecclesiastes 3:11) 
He has made everything beautiful in its time, and He has put eternity into their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God has done from the beginning to the end.

(Ecclesiastes 3:12) 
I have known that there is no better thing for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their life.

(Ecclesiastes 3:13) 
Also, that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—this is the gift of God.

(Ecclesiastes 3:14) 
I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. And this God does, so that men should fear Him.

(Ecclesiastes 3:15) 
That which has been is already, and that which is to be has already been. And God restores what has passed.

(Ecclesiastes 3:16) 
And moreover, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment, where wickedness was, and the place of righteousness, where wickedness was.

(Ecclesiastes 3:17) 
And I said in my heart, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked.” For there is a time for every matter, and for every work.

(Ecclesiastes 3:18) 
I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would test them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.

(Ecclesiastes 3:19) 
For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same: As one dies, so dies the other; and all have the same breath. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 3:20) 
All go to one place; all came from the dust, and all return to the dust.

(Ecclesiastes 3:21) 
Who knows whether the spirit of the sons of men ascends upward, and the spirit of the beasts descends downward to the earth?

(Ecclesiastes 3:22) 
So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what will be after him?

(Ecclesiastes 4:1) 
I then returned and saw all the oppression going on in the world. I observed the tears of the innocent, and there was no one to comfort them. They were being violently attacked by those in power, but there was no one to help them.

(Ecclesiastes 4:2) 
I consider those who have died to be more blessed than those who are still alive.

(Ecclesiastes 4:3) 
I even felt that it would be better not to have been born at all, so that one wouldn't see the evil that goes on in the world.

(Ecclesiastes 4:4) 
I noticed that all the hard work done by humans is fueled by envy of others.

(Ecclesiastes 4:5) 
This is vanity, a chasing after the wind, as the envious person tries to satisfy his own greed.

(Ecclesiastes 4:6) 
It is better to be satisfied with one handful of possessions than two handfuls, if you are working to gain those things with anxieties of the spirit.

(Ecclesiastes 4:7) 
This, too, is vanity and a striving after the wind.

(Ecclesiastes 4:8) 
There is also the case of the solitary man, who has no companion, no son or brother, and yet his work never ends, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches. He never thinks, "For whom am I working, and depriving myself of pleasure?"

(Ecclesiastes 4:9) 
This, too, is vanity, and a miserable business.

(Ecclesiastes 4:10) 
Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.

(Ecclesiastes 4:11) 
If either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But pity the person who falls and has no one to help him up.

(Ecclesiastes 4:12) 
Also, if two lie down, they will keep each other warm. But how can one person be warm alone?

(Ecclesiastes 4:13) 
Though one is overpowered, two can defend themselves. A three-ply cord is not easily broken.

(Ecclesiastes 4:14) 
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to heed warnings.

(Ecclesiastes 4:15) 
For even when the king was formerly imprisoned, he could come to power, and then another poor person could be born into the kingdom.

(Ecclesiastes 4:16) 
I considered all the living who are walking under the sun, and I was struck by the fact that the next young man will soon take over the kingdom.

(Ecclesiastes 4:17) 
There is no end to all those who preceded him, and those who come after will not rejoice in him. This, too, is vanity and striving after the wind.

(Ecclesiastes 5:1) 
Be careful when you go to the house of God. Give more heed to the Word of God than to the words of foolish men, lest you make a sacrifice to the folly of men.

(Ecclesiastes 5:2) 
Don’t speak rashly. Don’t let your heart be too quick to utter a word before God. God is in the universe, and you are upon the earth, so let your words be few.

(Ecclesiastes 5:3) 
For sleep comes with many activities, and the fool is recognized in much speech.

(Ecclesiastes 5:4) 
When you vow a vow to God, don’t delay to pay it, for God hates a foolish and unreliable promise. Whatever you vow, pay it.

(Ecclesiastes 5:5) 
It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.

(Ecclesiastes 5:6) 
Don’t let your mouth cause you to sin, and don’t say before an angel, “It was a mistake.” Don't let God, angry at your words, destroy the works of your hands.

(Ecclesiastes 5:7) 
When there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and many words. But you, fear God.

(Ecclesiastes 5:8) 
If you see the poor oppressed and justice and righteousness violently taken away in a judgment, don’t be surprised at this situation, because the highest is greater than the others, and there are higher ones than them, and still others higher than those.

(Ecclesiastes 5:9) 
Moreover, the advantage of the land is for all. Even a king depends on the harvest.

(Ecclesiastes 5:10) 
The one who loves money will not be satisfied with money. Whoever loves riches will get no fruit from them, and this too is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 5:11) 
When goods increase, so do those who consume them. So what advantage is there to the possessor except to see them with his eyes?

(Ecclesiastes 5:12) 
Sweet is the sleep of the worker, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich does not allow him to sleep.

(Ecclesiastes 5:13) 
There is also another most grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches preserved for the harm of their owners.

(Ecclesiastes 5:14) 
For riches are destroyed in evil circumstances, and when they beget a son, he comes to nothing.

(Ecclesiastes 5:15) 
As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return naked, and will take nothing for his labor that he can carry in his hand.

(Ecclesiastes 5:16) 
This is also a most grievous evil: that he departs in the same way that he came. What advantage then is it to him that he has labored for the wind?

(Ecclesiastes 5:17) 
All his days he eats in darkness, with much sorrow, and indignation, and grief.

(Ecclesiastes 5:18) 
Behold, what I have seen to be good and beautiful is to eat and drink and enjoy the good of one’s labor under the sun during the number of days of his life that God has given him, for this is his portion.

(Ecclesiastes 5:19) 
For everyone to whom God gives riches and possessions and grants the power to eat of them, to receive his portion, and to rejoice in his labor, this is a gift of God.

(Ecclesiastes 5:20) 
For he will not often remember the days of his life, because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.

(Ecclesiastes 6:1) 
Here's another problem I see happening among mankind:

(Ecclesiastes 6:2) 
A man to whom God gives wealth, property, and honor, and who lacks nothing of all he desires, but God doesn't let him enjoy any of it. Instead, a stranger consumes it. This is vanity and great suffering.

(Ecclesiastes 6:3) 
If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, and accumulates many days of life, but his soul is not satisfied with good things, and he gets no proper burial, then I declare that an infant who died before birth is better off than he is.

(Ecclesiastes 6:4) 
The stillborn comes in vain, and goes into darkness, and his name is covered in shadows.

(Ecclesiastes 6:5) 
He never saw the sun, nor knew the difference between good and evil.

(Ecclesiastes 6:6) 
Even if he lived two thousand years, yet did not enjoy good things, wouldn't everything be heading to the same place?

(Ecclesiastes 6:7) 
All human labor is for his mouth, but his soul is never filled.

(Ecclesiastes 6:8) 
So, what does the wise man have more than the fool? And what does the poor man gain by living?

(Ecclesiastes 6:9) 
It is better to enjoy what you see than to give in to desire. But this too is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 6:10) 
Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known that man cannot fight against what is stronger than he is.

(Ecclesiastes 6:11) 
There are many things that multiply vanity; what does man have more than vanity?

(Ecclesiastes 6:12) 
For who knows what is good for man during his lifetime of vanity, which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?

(Ecclesiastes 7:1) 
A good reputation is better than expensive perfume, and the day of death is better than the day of birth.

(Ecclesiastes 7:2) 
It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting: because there we can contemplate the end of all things, and the living can remember what is to come.

(Ecclesiastes 7:3) 
Sorrow is better than laughter, because through sorrow, the mind can be corrected.

(Ecclesiastes 7:4) 
The wise have sorrow in their heart, but the fools have only the foolishness of laughter.

(Ecclesiastes 7:5) 
It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise than to the song of fools.

(Ecclesiastes 7:6) 
For as the sound of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: and this also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 7:7) 
Oppression makes the wise man foolish, and it destroys the strength of his heart.

(Ecclesiastes 7:8) 
The end of a matter is better than its beginning. It is better to be patient than to be proud.

(Ecclesiastes 7:9) 
Do not be quick to anger, for anger rests in the bosom of a fool.

(Ecclesiastes 7:10) 
Do not say: “Why do you think that the life of the past was better than this?” because that is a foolish question.

(Ecclesiastes 7:11) 
Wisdom is good with riches, and those who live under the light find benefit.

(Ecclesiastes 7:12) 
For under the shadow of wisdom and under the shadow of wealth, there is protection: but the knowledge of wisdom protects its owner.

(Ecclesiastes 7:13) 
Consider the works of God, for no one can correct what He has rejected.

(Ecclesiastes 7:14) 
On a good day, enjoy good things, and in the day of evil, consider: God made one against the other, so that man may not find anything against himself.

(Ecclesiastes 7:15) 
I have seen everything in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his justice, and there is a wicked man who lives a long time in his wickedness.

(Ecclesiastes 7:16) 
Do not be overly just, nor become wiser than necessary, lest you be astonished.

(Ecclesiastes 7:17) 
Do not be excessively wicked, nor become foolish. Why will you die before your time?

(Ecclesiastes 7:18) 
It is good to restrain yourself in these things and not withdraw your hand from them: for he who fears God keeps all the commandments.

(Ecclesiastes 7:19) 
Wisdom is stronger than seven powerful men who rule a city.

(Ecclesiastes 7:20) 
For there is scarcely any just man on earth, who does good and does not sin.

(Ecclesiastes 7:21) 
Do not take to heart all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.

(Ecclesiastes 7:22) 
For your heart often knows that many others have cursed you.

(Ecclesiastes 7:23) 
All these things I have tested in wisdom: I said, “I will be wise,” but it went far from me.

(Ecclesiastes 7:24) 
It was further away than it had been, and more profound. Who can find it?

(Ecclesiastes 7:25) 
I went around everything in my heart, so that I might know and consider and seek wisdom and reason, and so that I might know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:

(Ecclesiastes 7:26) 
And I found a woman more bitter than death, who is the snare of the heart, and a snare of the hunters: he who pleases God will escape her: but he who is a sinner will be caught by her.

(Ecclesiastes 7:27) 
Behold, this I have found, says Ecclesiastes, one after another to find reason.

(Ecclesiastes 7:28) 
Which my soul still seeks, and has not found: among a thousand men I found one, but among all women I did not find one.

(Ecclesiastes 7:29) 
This only have I found, that God made man upright, but he himself entangled himself in endless questions.

(Ecclesiastes 8:1) 
Who is like the wise man, and who understands the meaning of a word? A man's wisdom illuminates his face, and his face is changed.

(Ecclesiastes 8:2) 
I am instructed by the king and I obey the rules that God created.

(Ecclesiastes 8:3) 
Do not be in a hurry to leave his presence, and do not persist in evil.

(Ecclesiastes 8:4) 
Because he will do whatever he wants, and where the king's word is, there is power.

(Ecclesiastes 8:5) 
Anyone who obeys a command will not feel anything bad. The wise heart knows the proper timing.

(Ecclesiastes 8:6) 
Every matter has its own time and mode, and a lot of evil oppresses a man.

(Ecclesiastes 8:7) 
Because he does not know what will happen: and who will tell him the future?

(Ecclesiastes 8:8) 
A man does not have power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, nor power on the day of his death. He cannot win an evil conflict, nor can he save the one who is impious.

(Ecclesiastes 8:9) 
All of these things I have observed, and I have given my heart to all the works which are done under the sun, when a man rules over another man to his evil.

(Ecclesiastes 8:10) 
Then I saw the wicked buried, and those who worked in the holy place: and they were praised in the city for what they had done. And this is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 8:11) 
Because the sentence against the wicked is not quickly pronounced, therefore the children of men are full of evil hearts.

(Ecclesiastes 8:12) 
Even if the impious sins a hundred times, and God seems to have prolonged his life, I know that it will be good for those who fear God, who revere His face.

(Ecclesiastes 8:13) 
But it will not be good for the wicked man, nor will he prolong his shadow, as the shadow of a tree.

(Ecclesiastes 8:14) 
There is a vanity which occurs on the earth: there are just men to whom evils happen, as if they were the works of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom good things happen, as if they were the works of the just. This also is vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 8:15) 
I therefore praised joy, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink, and to be joyful, and that this should accompany him in his labor, during the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 8:16) 
I set my heart to know wisdom, and to see the activity which is carried on in the earth: because my eyes do not take sleep, day or night.

(Ecclesiastes 8:17) 
And I understood that all the works of God are, and a man cannot find the work that is done under the sun, and the more a man labors to seek, the less he will find.

(Ecclesiastes 8:18) 
Again I applied my heart to know wisdom, and foolishness and imprudence. And I knew that this was vanity too:

(Ecclesiastes 8:19) 
Because in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and whoever increases knowledge increases pain.

(Ecclesiastes 9:1) 
I considered all these things within my heart, so that I could investigate them, and see that the righteous, the wise, and their works are in God's hand. Yet, humanity doesn’t know if they are worthy of love or hate.

(Ecclesiastes 9:2) 
But one thing is certain, that all things come to the same end, because one fate befalls the righteous and the wicked, the good and the evil, the clean and the unclean, the one who sacrifices and the one who rejects sacrifice.

(Ecclesiastes 9:3) 
Because of this, I think it is absurd that the same death awaits the just and the unjust; the good and the bad both die.

(Ecclesiastes 9:4) 
Therefore, it is better for people to rejoice in their work, for this is their portion. Who can bring them back to know what is yet to come?

(Ecclesiastes 9:5) 
Do everything that you can do in life, because neither work, nor reason, nor knowledge, nor wisdom will be in the grave, where you are hastening.

(Ecclesiastes 9:6) 
I turned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the war to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor grace to the educated, nor riches to the skilled; but time and chance happen to them all.

(Ecclesiastes 9:7) 
Humanity doesn’t know its end; but as fish are caught with a hook, and as birds are caught in a snare, so humans are trapped in evil times when it suddenly comes upon them.

(Ecclesiastes 9:8) 
This, too, I have seen is wisdom, and is a great thing under the sun.

(Ecclesiastes 9:9) 
There was a small city with few men in it; a great king came against it and surrounded it and built fortifications around it to attack it.

(Ecclesiastes 9:10) 
A poor and wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city through his wisdom, but no one remembered that poor man afterwards.

(Ecclesiastes 9:11) 
And I said wisdom is better than strength; and how the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.

(Ecclesiastes 9:12) 
The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the clamor of a prince among fools.

(Ecclesiastes 9:13) 
Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one who sins destroys many good things.

(Ecclesiastes 9:14) 
A dead fly spoils the sweet scent of the ointment. Glory and wisdom are despised, and a little brief hunger is more than foolishness and stupidity.

(Ecclesiastes 9:15) 
The words of the wise are gracious; the lips of a fool are his own destruction.

(Ecclesiastes 9:16) 
Blessed are you, land, whose king is a boy, and whose princes eat in the morning.

(Ecclesiastes 9:17) 
Blessed are you, land, whose king is noble and whose princes eat in due time, for food and not in luxury.

(Ecclesiastes 9:18) 
Through laziness, the building decays; through the idleness of hands, the house drips.

(Ecclesiastes 9:19) 
Men make a feast for laughter, and wine makes the living happy; and money answers everything.

(Ecclesiastes 9:20) 
Do not curse the king, nor in your heart curse the rich; do not curse the birds of the sky, because even the birds of the sky will carry the word, and the one who has wings will announce the judgment.

(Ecclesiastes 10:1) 
A dead fly ruins the value of perfumed oil, and wisdom and glory are more honorable than the foolishness of a little while.

(Ecclesiastes 10:2) 
The heart of the wise man is on the right, and the heart of the fool is on the left.

(Ecclesiastes 10:3) 
Even when the fool walks on the road, he thinks everyone else is a fool.

(Ecclesiastes 10:4) 
If the authority of a ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; because submission makes even great sins stop.

(Ecclesiastes 10:5) 
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, something that seems to come by accident from the presence of the ruler:

(Ecclesiastes 10:6) 
A fool is placed in high office, while rich men are seated below.

(Ecclesiastes 10:7) 
I have seen servants riding on horses, and princes walking like servants on the ground.

(Ecclesiastes 10:8) 
The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.

(Ecclesiastes 10:9) 
The one who moves stones will be hurt by them, and the one who splits wood will be in danger from it.

(Ecclesiastes 10:10) 
If the iron is blunt, and this is not sharp, but blunted, great effort is needed: and after hard work, wisdom will offer aid.

(Ecclesiastes 10:11) 
If a serpent bites in silence, the whisperer is no less dangerous; he who secretly slanders, destroys his own soul.

(Ecclesiastes 10:12) 
The words of the wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of the fool swallow him.

(Ecclesiastes 10:13) 
The beginning of his mouth’s words is foolishness, and the beginning of his mouth is the worst madness.

(Ecclesiastes 10:14) 
The fool multiplies words.

(Ecclesiastes 10:15) 
The ignorant man doesn't know what will happen, and who will tell him what will be after him?

(Ecclesiastes 10:16) 
Woe to you, O land, whose king is a child, and whose leaders eat in the morning.

(Ecclesiastes 10:17) 
Blessed is the land whose king is noble, and whose leaders eat at the right time, for strength, and not for excess.

(Ecclesiastes 10:18) 
Through laziness the roof will fall in, and through idleness the house will decay.

(Ecclesiastes 10:19) 
Feasting provides bread, and wine cheers the living, but money answers all things.

(Ecclesiastes 10:20) 
Also, do not curse the king even in your thought, and do not curse the rich in your private chamber: for the birds of the sky will carry your voice, and the one with wings will report the word.

(Ecclesiastes 11:1) 
Cast your bread upon the water, for in time you will find it.

(Ecclesiastes 11:2) 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for you do not know what evil will come upon the earth.

(Ecclesiastes 11:3) 
If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth. If a tree falls towards the south or the north, it will stay where it fell.

(Ecclesiastes 11:4) 
Whoever watches the wind will not sow, and whoever observes the clouds will never reap.

(Ecclesiastes 11:5) 
Just as you do not know the way of the spirit, or how bones are formed in the womb of a pregnant woman: so you do not know the work of God, who works everything.

(Ecclesiastes 11:6) 
Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters: for after many days you will find it.

(Ecclesiastes 11:7) 
Give a portion to seven, and even to eight: for you do not know what evil will be upon the earth.

(Ecclesiastes 11:8) 
If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth: and if a tree falls towards the north or the south, it will remain where it fell.

(Ecclesiastes 11:9) 
Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: and know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.

(Ecclesiastes 11:10) 
Remove anger from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh. For youth and pleasure are vain.

(Ecclesiastes 12:1) 
Remember your Creator in your youth, before the days of trial come, and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them."

(Ecclesiastes 12:2) 
Before the sun and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:

(Ecclesiastes 12:3) 
When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders be dark in the windows,

(Ecclesiastes 12:4) 
And the door shall be shut in the street, when the voice of the grinder is low, and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low.

(Ecclesiastes 12:5) 
And they shall be afraid of the high places, and they shall be afraid in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall be made fat, and the caper fruit shall be scattered: because man goeth into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall go about in the street.

(Ecclesiastes 12:6) 
Before the silver cord be broken, and the golden fillet be broken, and the pitcher be broken over the fountain, and the wheel be broken over the cistern,

(Ecclesiastes 12:7) 
And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.

(Ecclesiastes 12:8) 
Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, and all things are vanity.

(Ecclesiastes 12:9) 
And whereas the Preacher was wise, he taught the people, and declared what he had done, and composed many parables.

(Ecclesiastes 12:10) 
He sought to find profitable words, and to write truth, and to write truth of words.

(Ecclesiastes 12:11) 
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails driven into the depths, which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd.

(Ecclesiastes 12:12) 
And more than these, my son, be thou warned: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.

(Ecclesiastes 12:13) 
Let us all hear together the end of the discourse: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is all man.

(Ecclesiastes 12:14) 
For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
