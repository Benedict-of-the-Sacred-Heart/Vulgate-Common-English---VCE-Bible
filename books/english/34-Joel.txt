(Joel 1:1) 
The following is the word of the Lord, which came to Joel, the son of Fathuël.

(Joel 1:2) 
Listen to this, you elders, and hear with your ears, all inhabitants of the earth: Has anything like this happened in your time, or in the time of your ancestors?

(Joel 1:3) 
Tell your children this, and let your children tell their children, and their children tell the next generation.

(Joel 1:4) 
What the locusts left, the swarming locusts ate. What the swarming locusts left, the grasshoppers ate, and what the grasshoppers left, the mildew ate.

(Joel 1:5) 
Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! And wail, all you who drink wine in sweetness, because it is taken away from your mouth.

(Joel 1:6) 
For a nation has come up upon my land, strong and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its molar teeth are those of a lioness.

(Joel 1:7) 
It has made my vineyard a desolation, and my fig tree a ruin. It has stripped it bare, and cast it away; its branches are despised.

(Joel 1:8) 
Lament like a virgin, girded with sackcloth, for the husband of her youth.

(Joel 1:9) 
The sacrifice and the libation are cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the ministers of the Lord, are in mourning.

(Joel 1:10) 
The fields are wasted, the ground is in mourning, because the wheat is ruined, the wine is dried up, the oil is gone.

(Joel 1:11) 
The farmers are ashamed; the vinedressers wail over the wheat and the barley, for the harvest of the field has perished.

(Joel 1:12) 
The vine has dried up, and the fig tree is broken. The pomegranate, the palm, the apple, and all the trees of the field have withered; because joy has failed from the sons of men.

(Joel 1:13) 
Gird yourselves and lament, priests; wail, ministers of the altar. Go in, lie in sackcloth, ministers of my God, because the sacrifice and the libation are cut off from the house of your God.

(Joel 1:14) 
Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly; gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of your God, and cry out to the Lord.

(Joel 1:15) 
Alas for the day, because the day of the Lord is near, and it will come like a desolation from the Almighty.

(Joel 1:16) 
Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes, joy and exultation from the house of our God?

(Joel 1:17) 
The seeds have withered under the clods; the barns have been laid waste; because there is no grain.

(Joel 1:18) 
How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are moaning, because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are scattered.

(Joel 1:19) 
To you, Lord, I will cry out, because fire has devoured the beauty of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the region.

(Joel 1:20) 
Even the beasts of the field long for you, because the torrent of waters is dried up, and fire has devoured the beauty of the wilderness.

(Joel 2:1) 
Sound the trumpet in Zion! Give a warning cry on My holy mountain! Let all who live on earth tremble, because the day of the Lord is coming soon.

(Joel 2:2) 
The day of darkness, of storm, of clouds, and of shadows is approaching! Like the dawn expanding on the mountains, there comes a great and mighty people the likes of which has never been, nor will there be again for generations to come.

(Joel 2:3) 
Ahead of them is a devouring fire, and behind them is a blazing flame. The land before them is as the Garden of Eden, and behind them, a desolate wasteland. Nothing escapes them.

(Joel 2:4) 
They look like horses, and they run like warriors on horseback.

(Joel 2:5) 
Like the sound of chariots, they rush over the mountaintops. Like the crackling of a fire devouring the stubble, they are a mighty people prepared for battle.

(Joel 2:6) 
Nations tremble at their approach; their faces are black like those of a boiling pot.

(Joel 2:7) 
They charge like warriors. Each goes straight ahead. They don’t get in each other’s way.

(Joel 2:8) 
They don't jostle one another; each marches straight ahead. They burst through windows like thieves.

(Joel 2:9) 
They storm the city; they run along the wall; they climb into the houses, entering like a thief through the windows.

(Joel 2:10) 
The earth quakes before them, and the sky trembles. The sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine.

(Joel 2:11) 
The Lord is giving his voice to His great army. The Lord's day is very great and exceedingly terrible. Who can endure it?

(Joel 2:12) 
So now, says the Lord, “Turn back to Me with all your heart, and fast, and weep, and mourn.

(Joel 2:13) 
Tear your hearts, not your clothes; return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love; and He relents over disaster.

(Joel 2:14) 
Who knows whether He will relent and leave behind Him a blessing, a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?

(Joel 2:15) 
Sound the trumpet in Zion! Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly.

(Joel 2:16) 
Gather the people, consecrate the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber.

(Joel 2:17) 
Between the porch and the altar, let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep. Let them say, “Spare Your people, O Lord, and give not Your heritage to reproach, that the nations may rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”

(Joel 2:18) 
Then the Lord became jealous for His land and had pity on His people.

(Joel 2:19) 
The Lord answered His people: “Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.

(Joel 2:20) 
I will remove the northern army far from you, and drive it into a barren and desolate land, its front to the eastern sea and its rear to the western sea. And its stench will rise, and its foul odor will go up, for it has done great things.”

(Joel 2:21) 
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord has done great things!

(Joel 2:22) 
Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit; the fig tree and vine give their strength.

(Joel 2:23) 
And children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your God! For He has given you the early rain for your vindication; and He will pour down for you the rain, both the early and the late.

(Joel 2:24) 
The threshing floors shall be full of grain; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

(Joel 2:25) 
“I will restore the years that the locust has eaten—the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, My great army, which I sent among you.

(Joel 2:26) 
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never again be put to shame.

(Joel 2:27) 
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God and there is no other. And My people shall never again be put to shame.

(Joel 2:28) 
“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.

(Joel 2:29) 
Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out My Spirit.

(Joel 2:30) 
“And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.

(Joel 2:31) 
The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.

(Joel 2:32) 
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.

(Joel 3:1) 
For, in those days, and at that time, I will restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem,

(Joel 3:2) 
I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of Josaphat. There I will judge them for what they did to My people and My inheritance, Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, and for dividing My land.

(Joel 3:3) 
They cast lots for My people, and gave a boy for a prostitute, and a girl for wine, so that they might drink.

(Joel 3:4) 
And what are you doing, Tyre, and Sidon, and all the territories of the Philistines? Are you trying to take My works from Me? Or what are you doing to Me?

(Joel 3:5) 
If you do these things, I will quickly and swiftly bring your actions down upon your own heads.

(Joel 3:6) 
You have taken My silver and gold, and have brought My precious and beautiful things into your temples.

(Joel 3:7) 
You have sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their territory.

(Joel 3:8) 
Behold, I will stir them up from the place where you have sold them, and I will return your retribution on your own heads.

(Joel 3:9) 
I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation, because the Lord has spoken.

(Joel 3:10) 
Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the soldiers advance and come forward!

(Joel 3:11) 
Beat your plowshares into swords and your spears into sickles. Let the weak say, “I am strong.”

(Joel 3:12) 
Hurry and come, all you nations from every side, and gather there; there the Lord will gather His mighty ones.

(Joel 3:13) 
Let the nations go down to the valley of Josaphat, because there I will sit to judge all the nations from every side.

(Joel 3:14) 
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread the winepress, for it is full; the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.

(Joel 3:15) 
Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of judgment! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of judgment.

(Joel 3:16) 
The sun and moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their brilliance.

(Joel 3:17) 
The Lord will roar from Zion, and give His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will shake, and the Lord will be the hope of His people and the strength of the children of Israel.

(Joel 3:18) 
And you will know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy, and strangers will no longer pass through it.

(Joel 3:19) 
And in that day, the mountains will drip with sweetness, and the hills will flow with milk and honey, and all the streams of Judah will flow with water. A fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, and will water the torrent of thorns.

(Joel 3:20) 
Egypt will become a desolation, and Edom a desert wasteland, because they did evil to the sons of Judah and shed innocent blood in their land.

(Joel 3:21) 
But I will avenge their blood, and will not hold them guiltless, and the Lord will dwell in Zion.
