(Judges 1:1) 
After the death of Joshua, the sons of Israel consulted the Lord, asking: 'Who among us will go up first against the Canaanites, and be the leader of the war?'

(Judges 1:2) 
And the Lord said: 'Judah will go up; behold, I have given the land into his power.'

(Judges 1:3) 
And Judah said to Simeon, his brother: 'Come with me into my allotted territory, and fight against the Canaanites, so that I also may go with you into your allotted territory and help you.' And Simeon went with him.

(Judges 1:4) 
So Judah went up, and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their power. And they struck down ten thousand men in Bezek.

(Judges 1:5) 
And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and struck down the Canaanites and the Perizzites who were with him.

(Judges 1:6) 
But Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and captured him. They then cut off the tips of his hands and his feet.

(Judges 1:7) 
And Adoni-Bezek said: 'Seventy kings, with the tips of their hands and feet cut off, gathered the scraps of food under my table. As I have done to them, so God has now repaid me.' Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.

(Judges 1:8) 
The sons of Judah then attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They put to the sword all they found in it, and then burned the city walls with fire.

(Judges 1:9) 
And after these things, they went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountainous region, and to the south, and in the lowlands.

(Judges 1:10) 
Judah then went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (which was anciently called Kirjath-Arba), and struck down Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

(Judges 1:11) 
And from there he proceeded to the inhabitants of Debir, whose ancient name was Kirjath-Sepher, which means 'the city of books'.

(Judges 1:12) 
And Caleb said: 'Whoever strikes down Kirjath-Sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah, my daughter, as his wife.'

(Judges 1:13) 
And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. So Caleb gave him Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.

(Judges 1:14) 
As she went with Othniel, she urged her husband to ask her father for a field. She then dismounted from her donkey with a sigh of desire. And Caleb asked her: 'What do you want?'

(Judges 1:15) 
And she replied: 'Give me a special gift. You have given me dry land; now also grant me springs of water.' So Caleb gave her the upper spring and the lower spring.

(Judges 1:16) 
Now the children of the Kenite, Moses' relative by marriage, went up from the City of Palms (Jericho) with the sons of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which is to the south of Arad, and they lived there with them.

(Judges 1:17) 
Then Judah went with Simeon, his brother, and they struck down the Canaanites who lived in Zephath, and utterly destroyed them. So the name of the city was called Hormah.

(Judges 1:18) 
Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.

(Judges 1:19) 
And the Lord was with Judah, and they drove out the inhabitants of the mountainous region. But they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys, because those had many iron chariots with scythes.

(Judges 1:20) 
And they gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had said, and from there he drove out the three sons of Anak.

(Judges 1:21) 
But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until the present day.

(Judges 1:22) 
The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.

(Judges 1:23) 
For when they were besieging the city that was called Luzah (whose name in ancient times was Bethel),

(Judges 1:24) 
they saw a man coming out of the city, and they urged him, saying: 'Show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.'

(Judges 1:25) 
And when he showed them, they struck down the city with the edge of the sword. But they let that man and all his relatives go free.

(Judges 1:26) 
That man then went to the land of the Hittites and built a city there, and called its name Luzah. That is its name to this present day.

(Judges 1:27) 
Manasseh also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shean and Taanach with their surrounding villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo with their surrounding villages. So the Canaanites began to live among them.

(Judges 1:28) 
But after Israel became strong, they made the Canaanites subject to tribute, and were unwilling to drive them out completely.

(Judges 1:29) 
Ephraim also did not kill the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.

(Judges 1:30) 
Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol. Instead, the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to tribute.

(Judges 1:31) 
Asher also did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor of Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.

(Judges 1:32) 
So they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, and did not subdue them.

(Judges 1:33) 
Naphtali also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath. So they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath became subject to tribute to them.

(Judges 1:34) 
And the Amorites confined the sons of Dan to the mountainous region and did not allow them to come down to the plains.

(Judges 1:35) 
And the Amorites lived in Mount Heres (which means 'clay-mountain' or 'sun-mountain'), in Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But the power of the house of Joseph was strong enough, so they became subject to tribute to them.

(Judges 1:36) 
Now the territory of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim (Scorpion Pass), from Sela (Petra), and the higher places above it.

(Judges 1:1) 
After Joshua died, the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying: "Who among us should go up first against the Canaanites, and lead us in this war?"

(Judges 1:2) 
And the Lord replied: "The tribe of Judah will go up first. Understand this: I have already given this land into their power."

(Judges 1:3) 
So the tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, their kinsman: "Come with me into the territory that was allotted to my tribe, and let us fight against the Canaanites there. In return, I will also go with you into the territory allotted to your tribe." And the tribe of Simeon went with them.

(Judges 1:4) 
So the tribe of Judah went into battle, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their power. They struck down ten thousand men at a place called Bezek.

(Judges 1:5) 
They found the king of Bezek, Adonibezek, in the city of Bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites.

(Judges 1:6) 
Adonibezek fled, but they pursued and captured him. Then they cut off the thumbs of his hands and the great toes of his feet.

(Judges 1:7) 
Adonibezek then said: "Seventy kings, whom I had mutilated by cutting off their thumbs and great toes, used to gather the scraps from under my table. As I have done to them, so God has now done to me." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.

(Judges 1:8) 
After this, the sons of Judah attacked Jerusalem. They captured it, put everyone they found in it to the sword, and burned the entire city with fire.

(Judges 1:9) 
After taking Jerusalem, they went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountainous regions, the southern lands, and the plains.

(Judges 1:10) 
The tribe of Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (Hebron was formerly called Kirjath-Arba, meaning 'the city of Arba, the father of the giants.') There, they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai—three of the Anakim, who were giants.

(Judges 1:11) 
From there, they went against the inhabitants of Debir, whose old name was Kirjath-Sepher, which means "the city of books" or "the city of letters."

(Judges 1:12) 
Then Caleb said: "Whoever attacks Kirjath-Sepher and captures it, to that man I will give Achsah, my daughter, to be his wife."

(Judges 1:13) 
And so Othniel, the son of Kenaz (who was Caleb's younger brother, and thus Othniel's uncle), attacked and captured it. In fulfillment of his promise, Caleb gave him Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.

(Judges 1:14) 
As she was being led away to her husband, Achsah urged Othniel to ask her father for a field. Then, as she sat on her donkey, she sighed, perhaps in expectation or anxiety. Caleb asked her, "What is it you want?"

(Judges 1:15) 
But she replied: "Please give me a special gift, a blessing for my inheritance. You have given me land in the arid south. Now, please add also some watered land." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs of water.

(Judges 1:16) 
Now, the descendants of the Kenite, who were relatives of Moses (from his father-in-law Jethro's lineage), had gone up from Jericho, "the City of Palm Trees." They went with the sons of Judah into the desert region, south of Arad, and settled there among them.

(Judges 1:17) 
So the tribe of Judah then went with the tribe of Simeon, their kinsman, and they struck down the Canaanites who lived in Zephath. They utterly destroyed the city and its inhabitants, and the city was then called Hormah, meaning "destruction."

(Judges 1:18) 
The tribe of Judah passed through Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, as well as their surrounding territories. (This implies they didn't fully conquer and hold these Philistine strongholds).

(Judges 1:19) 
The Lord was with the tribe of Judah, and they conquered the inhabitants of the mountainous regions. However, they were unable to drive out the inhabitants of the valleys, because those people were equipped with chariots made of iron.

(Judges 1:20) 
They gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised, and Caleb successfully drove out from there the three sons of Anak.

(Judges 1:21) 
However, the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusite inhabitants of Jerusalem. So, the Jebusites continued to live alongside the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem, right up to the time this account was written.

(Judges 1:22) 
The tribes descended from Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) also went up to attack Bethel, and the Lord was with them.

(Judges 1:23) 
They sent spies to reconnoiter the city, which had previously been called Luz.

(Judges 1:24) 
The spies saw a man leaving the city and said to him: "Show us how to enter the city, and we will show you mercy."

(Judges 1:25) 
When he showed them an entrance, they attacked the city and put all its inhabitants to the sword. But they allowed that man and his entire family to depart unharmed.

(Judges 1:26) 
That man went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz. That has remained its name even to the present day.

(Judges 1:27) 
But the tribe of Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, or Megiddo, nor the inhabitants of their surrounding villages. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them in those places.

(Judges 1:28) 
When the people of Israel grew stronger, they indeed subjected the Canaanites to forced labor and tribute. However, they were unwilling to completely drive them out as God had commanded.

(Judges 1:29) 
Likewise, the tribe of Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live alongside them in Gezer.

(Judges 1:30) 
The tribe of Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol. Instead, the Canaanites lived among them and became forced laborers.

(Judges 1:31) 
The tribe of Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.

(Judges 1:32) 
So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, failing to drive them out.

(Judges 1:33) 
Naphtali also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh or Beth-Anath. Instead, they lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and the people of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath became their forced laborers.

(Judges 1:34) 
The Amorites, however, confined the sons of Dan to the mountainous regions, not allowing them to come down into the plains.

(Judges 1:35) 
The Amorites remained in Mount Heres (which means "Mount of Pottery"), in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. However, the influence and power of the House of Joseph eventually grew stronger, and they forced these Amorites to become their tribute-paying laborers.

(Judges 1:36) 
The boundary of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim, continuing through Sela and beyond. (This indicates the southern extent of their power or where the Israelites contained them).

(Judges 2:1) 
And the Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to the place of weeping, and He said: 'I led you out of Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. And I promised that I would never break My covenant with you, for all time;'

(Judges 2:2) 
'provided only that you would not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land, but instead, you were to tear down their altars. Yet you refused to obey My voice. Why did you do this?'

(Judges 2:3) 
Therefore, I also refused to drive them out from before you. Instead, they will be a snare to you, and their gods will become a stumbling block for you.'

(Judges 2:4) 
And when the Angel of the Lord spoke all these words to all the sons of Israel, they raised their voices and wept aloud.

(Judges 2:5) 
And they called the name of that place 'The Place of Weepers', and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.

(Judges 2:6) 
Therefore, Joshua dismissed the sons of Israel, and each man went to his own allotted land to take possession of it.

(Judges 2:7) 
And the people served the Lord all the days that Joshua lived, and all the days of the elders who continued to live long after Joshua, and who had seen all the powerful works that the Lord had done for Israel.

(Judges 2:8) 
But Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.

(Judges 2:9) 
And they buried him within the borders of his allotted territory, in Timnath-Serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.

(Judges 2:10) 
And all that generation was gathered to their fathers through death. Then another people arose after them, who did not know the Lord, nor the powerful works that He had done for Israel.

(Judges 2:11) 
And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they began to serve the Baals.

(Judges 2:12) 
And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had led them out of the land of Egypt. They followed after foreign gods, choosing from among the gods of the peoples who lived around them, and they worshipped these false gods. In doing so, they provoked the Lord to anger.

(Judges 2:13) 
And they abandoned the Lord and served Baal and the Astartes.

(Judges 2:14) 
And the Lord, being angry with Israel, handed them over to plunderers, who stole from them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies who lived around them, and they were no longer able to resist their adversaries.

(Judges 2:15) 
But wherever they wanted to go, the hand of the Lord turned against them, just as He had spoken and sworn to them. And they were greatly afflicted and suffered severely.

(Judges 2:16) 
Then the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them from the hands of their devastators.

(Judges 2:17) 
But they refused to listen even to the judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with foreign gods and worshipped them. They quickly abandoned the way that their fathers had walked, and though they heard the commands of the Lord, they did everything contrary to them.

(Judges 2:18) 
And when the Lord raised up judges, during the days of these judges, the Lord was moved to pity because of the groans of those who were oppressed and afflicted by their tormentors.

(Judges 2:19) 
But after the death of a judge, they again returned to their evil ways and did things much worse than their fathers had done, following foreign gods, serving them, and worshipping them. They did not abandon their corrupt practices, nor the stubborn path in which they had grown accustomed to walk.

(Judges 2:20) 
And the wrath of the Lord burned against Israel, and He said: 'Because this nation has transgressed My covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and they refused to obey My voice;'

(Judges 2:21) 
'I also will no longer drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left remaining, not having caused them to perish completely;'

(Judges 2:22) 
'so that through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it, as their fathers did, or not.'

(Judges 2:23) 
Therefore, the Lord allowed all these nations to remain. He did not immediately drive them out, nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.

(Judges 2:1) 
And the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to 'The Place of Weeping', and He declared: "I brought you out of Egypt and led you into the land which I swore to your fathers, and I promised that I would never make My covenant with you void forever:"

(Judges 2:2) 
"However, you were not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of this land, but you were to tear down their altars. Yet you refused to listen to My voice. Why have you done this?"

(Judges 2:3) 
"Therefore, I also decided not to drive them out from before you, so that they would be a snare to you, and their gods would be a stumbling block to you."

(Judges 2:4) 
And when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, they raised their voices and wept aloud.

(Judges 2:5) 
And the name of that place was called 'The Place of Weeping', and they offered sacrifices there to the Lord.

(Judges 2:6) 
So Joshua sent the people away, and each went to his own inheritance to take possession of it.

(Judges 2:7) 
And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived for a long time after him, who had known all the works of the Lord that He had done for Israel.

(Judges 2:8) 
Now Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.

(Judges 2:9) 
And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, in Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

(Judges 2:10) 
And all that generation was gathered to their fathers—meaning they died off—and another people arose who did not know the Lord, nor the works that He had done for Israel.

(Judges 2:11) 
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served the Baals—false gods.

(Judges 2:12) 
And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had led them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who lived around them, and they worshipped them. And they provoked the Lord to anger.

(Judges 2:13) 
They forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Astarte.

(Judges 2:14) 
So the Lord became angry with Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them. He also delivered them into the hands of all their surrounding enemies, so that they could not stand against their adversaries.

(Judges 2:15) 
Wherever they wanted to go, the hand of the Lord was against them to their detriment, just as He had spoken and sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.

(Judges 2:16) 
Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them from the hands of those who devastated them.

(Judges 2:17) 
But they would not listen to these judges either; instead, they committed spiritual fornication with other gods and worshipped them. They quickly turned away from the path their fathers had walked, who had listened to the commandments of the Lord; they did everything contrary.

(Judges 2:18) 
And whenever the Lord raised up judges, in those days the Lord would relent and be moved to pity because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them. For He would not permit them to be tormented further.

(Judges 2:19) 
But after the judge died, they would turn back and act even worse than their fathers had done, following other gods, serving them, and worshipping them. They would not abandon their evil practices, nor the stubborn way they had accustomed themselves to walk.

(Judges 2:20) 
So the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and He said: "Because this people has made My covenant void, which I commanded their fathers, and they have refused to listen to My voice,"

(Judges 2:21) 
"I also will no longer drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua had left behind when he died,"

(Judges 2:22) 
"so that through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not."

(Judges 2:23) 
Therefore, the Lord allowed all these nations to remain, and He did not quickly drive them out, nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.

(Judges 3:1) 
These are the nations that the Lord God allowed to remain in the land—specifically, so that through them He could train the Israelites, especially those who had not personally experienced the wars in Canaan.

(Judges 3:2) 
God's purpose was that at least the future generations of the Israelites would learn and be taught how to fight effectively against their enemies.

(Judges 3:3) 
These nations included: the five lords of the Philistines; all the Canaanites; the Sidonians; and the Hivites who lived in the region of Mount Lebanon, stretching from Mount Baal-hermon all the way to the entrance of Hamath.

(Judges 3:4) 
And these nations were specifically left so that the Israelites would be tested through them. This would reveal whether they truly loved and obeyed the commandments of the Lord God, which He had given to their ancestors through Moses, or if they would disobey Him.

(Judges 3:5) 
Therefore, the sons of Israel began to live among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

(Judges 3:6) 
They began to take the daughters of these foreign peoples as wives, and they gave their own daughters to the sons of these peoples, and then they began to serve the gods of these nations.

(Judges 3:7) 
The sons of Israel committed evil in the sight of the Lord God. They forgot the Lord their God and began to serve the Baals and the Astartes—false gods and goddesses of the surrounding nations.

(Judges 3:8) 
So, the Lord God's anger was kindled against Israel. He delivered them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. The Israelites served this king for eight years.

(Judges 3:9) 
Then the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord God for help. The Lord God raised up a deliverer for them who saved them—specifically, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, who was the younger brother of Caleb.

(Judges 3:10) 
The Spirit of the Lord God came upon Othniel, and he judged and led Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord God delivered Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Syria, into his hand. Othniel then utterly prevailed over him.

(Judges 3:11) 
After this victory, the land had peace for forty years. Then Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.

(Judges 3:12) 
But again, the sons of Israel continued to commit evil in the sight of the Lord God. Because they sinned against Him, the Lord God strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, to be their enemy.

(Judges 3:13) 
Eglon gathered the sons of Ammon and Amalek to join him. He went and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms—Jericho.

(Judges 3:14) 
So the sons of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, for eighteen years.

(Judges 3:15) 
And afterward, they cried out to the Lord God for help. The Lord God raised up a deliverer for them named Ehud, the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. Ehud was a left-handed man, using both hands as if they were his right. The sons of Israel sent gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab, through Ehud.

(Judges 3:16) 
Ehud had made for himself a double-edged sword, about a cubit (a Roman palm, or 7-9 inches) in length, with the hilt in the middle. He fastened it under his clothing on his right thigh—making it unusual for a right-handed guard to search for it there.

(Judges 3:17) 
Ehud presented the gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab. Now, King Eglon was an exceedingly fat man.

(Judges 3:18) 
After Ehud had finished presenting the gifts, he sent away the companions who had come with him.

(Judges 3:19) 
Ehud himself returned from Gilgal, where the idols were, and he said to the king, “I have a secret message for you, O King.” The king responded, “Silence!” And all who were around him then left the room.

(Judges 3:20) 
So Ehud went in to him. The king was sitting alone in his cool, summer upper room. Ehud then said, “I have a message from God for you.” Immediately, the king stood up from his throne.

(Judges 3:21) 
Then Ehud extended his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly with such force,

(Judges 3:22) 
that the hilt followed the blade into the wound, and the fat closed around the blade. Ehud did not pull the sword out; he left it completely embedded there. Immediately, the contents of the king's bowels came out through the wound.

(Judges 3:23) 
Ehud then went out through the porch, having closed and locked the doors of the upper room behind him.

(Judges 3:24) 
After he had left, the king's servants came in. Seeing the doors of the upper room closed, they said, “He is probably relieving himself in the cool, summer room.”

(Judges 3:25) 
They waited for a long time until they became embarrassed. When they saw that no one was opening the doors, they took a key, opened the doors, and found their lord lying on the floor, dead.

(Judges 3:26) 
But while they were waiting, Ehud escaped. He passed by the idols in the place where they were, evading capture, and came to Seirath.

(Judges 3:27) 
Immediately upon his arrival, he blew a trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel descended with him, with Ehud leading the way.

(Judges 3:28) 
He said to them, “Follow me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, the Moabites, into our hands!” So they went down with him and seized the fords of the Jordan River that led toward Moab, preventing anyone from crossing over.

(Judges 3:29) 
At that time, they struck down about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong and valiant warriors; not one of them could escape.

(Judges 3:30) 
So Moab was humbled on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had peace for eighty years.

(Judges 3:31) 
After Ehud, there was Shamgar, the son of Anath. He struck down six hundred Philistine men with an ox-goad—a long stick with a sharp point used to drive oxen. He also delivered Israel.

(Judges 3:32) 
But the sons of Israel again committed evil in the sight of the Lord God. So the Lord God abandoned them into the hand of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-Ha-goiim—meaning, 'Harosheth of the Gentiles' or 'Nations'.

(Judges 3:33) 
The sons of Israel cried out to the Lord God, because Jabin had cruelly oppressed them for twenty years. He possessed nine hundred iron chariots, and he had severely afflicted the Israelites.

(Judges 3:34) 
Now, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.

(Judges 3:35) 
She used to sit under a palm tree, which was named after her, located between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel would come up to her for every legal judgment and dispute.

(Judges 3:36) 
Deborah sent and called for Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-Naphtali. She said to him, “The Lord God of Israel has commanded you: Go, lead an army to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and the sons of Zebulun.

(Judges 3:37) 
I will bring Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and all his multitude, to you at the Kishon River. And I will deliver them into your hand.”

(Judges 3:38) 
Barak said to her, “If you come with me, I will go; but if you refuse to come with me, I will not go.”

(Judges 3:39) 
She said to him, “I will certainly go with you. However, the victory will not be to your honor, for Sisera will be delivered into the hand of a woman.” So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.

(Judges 3:40) 
And Barak gathered Naphtali and Zebulun in Kedesh. He went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Deborah with him as his companion.

(Judges 4:1) 
After Ehud, the son of Jemini, died, the sons of Israel again offended the Lord through their evil actions.

(Judges 4:2) 
The Lord then allowed Jabin, king of Canaan, to conquer them. Jabin ruled from Hazor. His army's commander was Sisara, who lived in Haroseth Goim.

(Judges 4:3) 
The sons of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, because King Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots and had severely oppressed them for twenty years.

(Judges 4:4) 
Now, during that time, a prophetess named Deborah, wife of Lapidoth, was leading the people of Israel as their judge.

(Judges 4:5) 
She sat under a palm tree that was named after her, located between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel would come up to her for every legal case and dispute.

(Judges 4:6) 
She sent a message, summoning Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-naphtali. She told him: "The Lord, the God of Israel, has given a command: 'Go and lead an army up to Mount Tabor. Take with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.'"

(Judges 4:7) 
"I will draw Sisara, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and all his forces, to the Kishon Stream, to meet you there. I will then deliver them into your hands."

(Judges 4:8) 
Barak replied to her: "If you come with me, I will go. But if you are unwilling to come with me, then I will not go."

(Judges 4:9) 
She answered him: "I will certainly go with you. But on this mission, the glory of victory will not be yours, because Sisara will be delivered into the hand of a woman." So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.

(Judges 4:10) 
Barak then called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and he marched up with ten thousand fighters, taking Deborah with him.

(Judges 4:11) 
Now Heber the Kenite had previously separated from the other Kenites, his brothers, who were descendants of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law. Heber had pitched his tents near the valley called Sennim, which was close to Kedesh.

(Judges 4:12) 
It was reported to Sisara that Barak, son of Abinoam, had ascended Mount Tabor.

(Judges 4:13) 
Immediately, Sisara gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and his entire army from Haroseth Goim, and led them to the Kishon Stream.

(Judges 4:14) 
Deborah then said to Barak: "Arise! This is the day in which the Lord has given Sisara into your hand. Behold, the Lord is going before you!" So Barak descended from Mount Tabor with his ten thousand men.

(Judges 4:15) 
And the Lord threw Sisara, all his chariots, and his entire multitude into a panic before Barak's sword. The rout was so complete that Sisara leaped down from his chariot and fled on foot.

(Judges 4:16) 
Barak pursued the fleeing chariots and the army all the way to Haroseth Goim. And the entire host of the enemy fell by the sword, until they were utterly destroyed.

(Judges 4:17) 
Sisara, however, fleeing on foot, arrived at the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. This was because there was a peace treaty between Jabin, king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.

(Judges 4:18) 
Jael then came out to meet Sisara and said to him: "Come in, my lord, come in to me, do not be afraid." When he had entered her tent, she covered him with a rug.

(Judges 4:19) 
Sisara said to her: "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again.

(Judges 4:20) 
Sisara then told her: "Stand at the entrance of the tent. If anyone comes asking you, saying: 'Is there anyone here?' you are to answer: 'There is no one.'"

(Judges 4:21) 
So Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg, and taking a hammer, she quietly and cautiously went in. She placed the tent peg against his temple, and then struck the hammer forcefully, driving the peg into his brain as he slept soundly. In this way, he died.

(Judges 4:22) 
And behold, Barak was coming, pursuing Sisara. Jael came out to meet him and said to him: "Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for." When he entered her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead, with the tent peg driven into his temple.

(Judges 4:23) 
So on that day, God brought low Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.

(Judges 4:24) 
And the sons of Israel continued to advance, growing stronger day by day in their resistance against Jabin, king of Canaan, until they completely destroyed him.

(Judges 4:1) 
After Ehud, their deliverer, had died, the people of Israel again committed sins before the Lord God.

(Judges 4:2) 
So the Lord God handed them over to the power of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. This king possessed nine hundred iron chariots, a formidable military force. He tyrannically oppressed the people of Israel for twenty years.

(Judges 4:3) 
The people of Israel then cried out to the Lord God, because this king had oppressed them most cruelly for those twenty years, especially with his nine hundred iron chariots providing him such military dominance.

(Judges 4:4) 
At that time, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lapidoth, was exercising leadership over the people of Israel.

(Judges 4:5) 
She sat under a palm tree, which was known by her name, located between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people of Israel would come to her there for every legal judgment and to receive her wisdom.

(Judges 4:6) 
Deborah sent for and summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-Naphtali. She said to him, 'The Lord God of Israel commands you: Go and lead an army to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.'

(Judges 4:7) 
'And I, the Lord God, will draw Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and all his forces, to meet you at the Kishon River. Then I will deliver them into your hand, granting you victory.'

(Judges 4:8) 
Barak replied to her, 'If you go with me, I will go to battle. But if you refuse to come, I will not proceed.'

(Judges 4:9) 
Deborah said to him, 'I will certainly go with you. However, the glory of this victory will not be yours, because Sisera will be delivered into the hand of a woman instead.' So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.

(Judges 4:10) 
Barak then sent for the men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and he marched up with ten thousand men, with Deborah personally leading them.

(Judges 4:11) 
Now Heber the Kenite, whose people were descendants of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses and traditionally allies of Israel, had separated himself from the other Kenites, his brethren. He had pitched his tents in the valley called Zaanaim, which was near Kedesh.

(Judges 4:12) 
It was reported to Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up with his forces to Mount Tabor.

(Judges 4:13) 
So Sisera gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and his entire army from Harosheth, a city of the Gentiles. He led them to the Kishon River.

(Judges 4:14) 
Then Deborah said to Barak, 'Arise! For this is the very day on which the Lord God has delivered Sisera into your hand. Behold, the Lord God Himself goes before you in battle!' So Barak descended from Mount Tabor, and his ten thousand men with him.

(Judges 4:15) 
And the Lord God struck terror into Sisera, his entire chariot force, and his whole army, causing them to be defeated by the edge of Barak's sword. Sisera himself, in desperation, leaped down from his chariot and fled on foot.

(Judges 4:16) 
Barak pursued the fleeing chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth, the city of the Gentiles. The entire multitude of the enemy was slain; not a single one was left alive.

(Judges 4:17) 
Sisera, still fleeing, arrived at the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. He sought refuge there because there was a treaty of peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite, making it seemingly a safe haven.

(Judges 4:18) 
So Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, 'Come in, my lord, do not be afraid.' When he entered her tent, she covered him with a rug for concealment and comfort.

(Judges 4:19) 
He said to her, 'Please give me a little water, for I am very thirsty.' But she opened a skin of milk and gave him to drink, a gesture of great hospitality. After he drank, she covered him again.

(Judges 4:20) 
Then Sisera instructed her, 'Stand at the entrance of the tent. If anyone comes asking you, saying, 'Is anyone here?' you must answer, 'No one is here.'

(Judges 4:21) 
But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and a hammer. She quietly and cautiously approached Sisera, who was deeply overcome by sleep and exhaustion, and placed the tent peg against his temple. She then drove the peg through his head and into the ground with the hammer, and so he died.

(Judges 4:22) 
Just then, Barak arrived, pursuing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, 'Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.' So he went into her tent and saw Sisera lying dead, with the tent peg driven into his temple.

(Judges 4:23) 
Thus, on that day, God thoroughly humbled Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the people of Israel, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.

(Judges 4:24) 
And the people of Israel, after this decisive victory, continued to press more and more upon Jabin, the king of Canaan, until he and his kingdom were utterly destroyed.

(Judges 5:1) 
And so, on that day, Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang this song, saying:

(Judges 5:2) 
For the people of Israel willingly offered themselves for battle—those who did not fear to fight—for this, praise the Lord!

(Judges 5:3) 
Hear this, O kings! And pay attention, O princes! I will sing to the Lord! I myself will sing praises, making melody to the Lord, the God of Israel!

(Judges 5:4) 
Lord, when You marched forth from Seir, when You advanced from the lands of Edom, the earth shook, and the skies poured down their water.

(Judges 5:5) 
The mountains melted away at the presence of the Lord, even Sinai itself trembled at the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Judges 5:6) 
In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted. Those who used to travel on them now walked through winding, secluded paths.

(Judges 5:7) 
The strong men—the leaders—in Israel ceased to lead; they rested, until Deborah arose, until a mother arose in Israel to guide them.

(Judges 5:8) 
The Lord chose new wars and personally overturned the gates of the enemies. Not a shield or a spear was seen among the forty thousand warriors of Israel.

(Judges 5:9) 
My heart loves the leaders of Israel, who willingly risked themselves. Bless the Lord!

(Judges 5:10) 
You who ride on shining donkeys, you who sit in judgment, and you who travel along the roads—speak of these events!

(Judges 5:11) 
Where the water-drawers sing loudly, there let them recount the righteous acts of the Lord and His strength in Israel. Then the Lord's people went down to the city gates, prepared for battle.

(Judges 5:12) 
Arise, arise, Deborah! Arise, arise, and sing your song! Arise, Barak, and capture your captives, O son of Abinoam!

(Judges 5:13) 
Then the remnant of the people turned to the Lord. The mighty leader came down to me; the Lord’s people stood among the strong.

(Judges 5:14) 
From Ephraim, their root, came those against Amalek; and after you, Benjamin, among your people. From Machir came down leaders, and from Zebulun came those who began to lead the army.

(Judges 5:15) 
The commanders of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak. How the strongest warrior was scattered, his feet ran headlong into the valley! Among the clans of Reuben, great divisions and arguments were found.

(Judges 5:16) 
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, listening to the whistling of the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben, great divisions and arguments were found.

(Judges 5:17) 
Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. Dan remained by his ships. Asher dwelt by the seashore and remained in his harbors.

(Judges 5:18) 
But Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives even unto death, on the high ground of Merom.

(Judges 5:19) 
The kings came, and they fought. The kings of Canaan fought in Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no plunder.

(Judges 5:20) 
From the sky, they were fought against! The stars themselves, remaining in their order and course, fought against Sisera.

(Judges 5:21) 
The torrent of Kishon swept away their bodies—the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Kishon! My soul, trample down the mighty!

(Judges 5:22) 
The hooves of the horses beat rapidly, as the strongest warriors fled in a frenzy.

(Judges 5:23) 
“Curse Meroz,” said the Angel of the Lord. “Curse its inhabitants, because they did not come to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of His strong warriors!”

(Judges 5:24) 
May Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be blessed above all women, and may she be blessed within her tent.

(Judges 5:25) 
He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a noble bowl, she offered him curdled milk.

(Judges 5:26) 
She reached out her left hand for a tent peg, and her right hand for a workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera, finding a vulnerable spot on his head, and pierced his temples.

(Judges 5:27) 
Between her feet, he sank down, he collapsed, and he died. Between her feet, he lay, and he perished.

(Judges 5:28) 
Through the window, Sisera's mother looked out, and wailed, lamenting through her tears: “Why is his chariot so slow to return? Why have the wheels of his chariots delayed?”

(Judges 5:29) 
One of her wise noblewomen answered her, and she herself repeated these words to the other women:

(Judges 5:30) 
“Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils! Sisera is taking as plunder the most beautiful and varied garments, and necklaces and richly colored jewels are being placed around his neck.”

(Judges 5:31) 
May all Your enemies perish in this way, O Lord! But may those who love You shine like the sun when it rises in its full glory. And the land had rest for forty years.

(Judges 5:1) 
On that day, Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoem, sang this song, saying:

(Judges 5:2) 
You, the people, offered yourselves willingly to fight. For this, bless the Lord.

(Judges 5:3) 
Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you rulers! It is I, I myself, who will sing to the Lord; I will make music for the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Judges 5:4) 
Lord, when you came forth from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth shook violently. The skies also dripped, and the clouds poured down water.

(Judges 5:5) 
The mountains flowed, trembling before the face of the Lord. Mount Sinai itself trembled before the face of the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Judges 5:6) 
In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted. Those who used to travel on them instead walked on winding, hidden paths, avoiding the public routes.

(Judges 5:7) 
The brave warriors in Israel had ceased fighting; they had rested, until Deborah rose up. She rose as a mother figure to guide Israel.

(Judges 5:8) 
When new wars came, the Lord chose to fight. He Himself overthrew the gates of the enemies. But among the forty thousand warriors of Israel, no shield or spear was seen in their hands; they were unarmed.

(Judges 5:9) 
My heart loves the leaders of Israel, the ones who willingly put themselves in danger. For this, bless the Lord.

(Judges 5:10) 
You who ride on shining donkeys, you who sit in judgment, and you who travel on the roads, speak of these events.

(Judges 5:11) 
There, where they gathered to declare the righteous acts of the Lord and the just deeds of His mighty warriors in Israel, the people of the Lord then went down to the city gates and fought the enemy.

(Judges 5:12) 
Arise, arise, Deborah! Arise, arise, and speak the song of victory! Arise, Barak, and take your captives, O son of Abinoem!

(Judges 5:13) 
Then the remnant of the people of the Lord came down with the mighty ones. The Lord gave me leaders over the powerful people.

(Judges 5:14) 
From Ephraim, they marched against the Amalekites. After you, O Benjamin, came against your own peoples, O Amalek. From Machir, leaders descended to join the fight, and from Zebulun came those who led the army.

(Judges 5:15) 
The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak. The men of Issachar followed in the footsteps of Deborah and Barak, directing their forces into the valley. But among the divisions of Reuben, there were great hesitations of heart.

(Judges 5:16) 
Why did you sit among the two sheepfolds, listening to the whistles of the flocks, Reuben? Among the divisions of Reuben, there were great internal questionings and indecisions of heart.

(Judges 5:17) 
Gilead stayed across the Jordan River and remained there. Why did Dan linger by his ships? Asher settled on the seashore and remained in his harbors, not joining the battle.

(Judges 5:18) 
But Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives, offering themselves to death, in the region of Merom.

(Judges 5:19) 
The kings came and fought. The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach, near the waters of Megiddo. But they took no plunder of silver; they gained nothing from their looting.

(Judges 5:20) 
From the sky, the battle was waged against them. The stars, remaining in their fixed order and moving in their courses, fought against Sisara.

(Judges 5:21) 
The Kishon River swept away their dead bodies; that ancient river, the Kishon River. My soul, trample down the mighty warriors!

(Judges 5:22) 
The hooves of the horses pounded furiously, as the mightiest warriors fled in a frenzy.

(Judges 5:23) 
“Curse Meroz!” said the Angel of the Lord. “Curse its inhabitants, because they did not come to the aid of the Lord, to help Him alongside the mightiest warriors.”

(Judges 5:24) 
May Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be blessed above all women. May she be blessed within her tent, in her home.

(Judges 5:25) 
He asked for water, but she gave him milk. In a bowl fit for a prince, she offered him curdled milk or butter, a thick, rich drink.

(Judges 5:26) 
She reached out her left hand for a tent peg, and her right hand for a workman's hammer. She struck Sisara, seeking to inflict a wound to his head, and pierced through his temples.

(Judges 5:27) 
Between her feet he sank down, he faltered, and then he died. Between her feet he collapsed, and there he lay lifeless.

(Judges 5:28) 
Through the window, Sisara's mother looked out and cried loudly. From the rooftop, she spoke, saying: “Why is his chariot so long in returning? Why have the hoofbeats of his chariots been delayed?”

(Judges 5:29) 
One of her wisest wives answered her, and she too spoke to her mother's words, providing an explanation:

(Judges 5:30) 
“Perhaps he is now dividing the plunder. There will be the most beautiful of garments, and brightly embroidered cloths, to adorn the necks of the captives. For each man, there will be a single spoil to take home.”

(Judges 5:31) 
May all your enemies perish in this way, O Lord! But may those who love you shine forth like the sun, going out in its full strength. And so, the land had peace for forty years.

(Judges 6:1) 
But the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and because of this, He delivered them into the power of Midian for seven years.

(Judges 6:2) 
And they were severely oppressed by Midian. Because of this, the sons of Israel made for themselves caves in the mountains, hollows in the ground, and many fortified strongholds.

(Judges 6:3) 
Whenever Israel had sown their crops, Midian and Amalek and the other peoples from the East would invade their land.

(Judges 6:4) 
They would spread out and devastate the entire region, destroying everything as far as Gaza. They would leave nothing for the people of Israel to eat, neither sheep, oxen, nor donkeys.

(Judges 6:5) 
For they themselves would come with their tents and their entire herds, and like swarms of locusts, they would fill up the land. The men and their camels were innumerable, and wherever they went, they devastated everything.

(Judges 6:6) 
And so, Israel was brought very low and humbled before Midian. And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord for help.

(Judges 6:7) 
And when they had cried out to the Lord because of Midian,

(Judges 6:8) 
the Lord sent a prophet to them, who spoke these words: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'I made you ascend from the land of Egypt and led you out of that house of slavery.

(Judges 6:9) 
I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your enemies who afflicted you. I drove them out from before you and gave their land to you.

(Judges 6:10) 
And I said: "I am the Lord your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living." But you would not listen to My voice.'"

(Judges 6:11) 
Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree that was in Ephra, which belonged to Joas, the father of the family of Ezri. And his son, Gideon, was threshing and cleaning wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.

(Judges 6:12) 
The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: "The Lord is with you, O mighty warrior."

(Judges 6:13) 
And Gideon said to Him: "Please, my Lord, if the Lord is with us, why have all these things happened to us? Where are all His miracles that our fathers told us about, saying: 'The Lord led us out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and delivered us into the power of Midian."

(Judges 6:14) 
And the Lord looked at him and said: "Go in this strength of yours, and you will deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Know for certain that I Myself have sent you."

(Judges 6:15) 
And Gideon, responding, said: "Please, my Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least significant in my father's house."

(Judges 6:16) 
And the Lord said to him: "I will be with you. And you will strike down Midian as if they were only one man."

(Judges 6:17) 
And Gideon said: "If I have found favor in your sight, give me a sign to prove that it is You who are speaking to me."

(Judges 6:18) 
"Do not depart from here until I return to You and bring my offering and set it before You." And He replied: "I will wait for your return."

(Judges 6:19) 
So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour, he made unleavened bread. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. Then he brought it all out and offered it under the oak tree.

(Judges 6:20) 
And the Angel of the Lord said to him: "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, and place them on that rock, and pour the broth over them." And when he had done so,

(Judges 6:21) 
the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the staff that He held in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Then fire came out from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread, and the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.

(Judges 6:22) 
And when Gideon saw that it had been the Angel of the Lord, he said: "Alas, my Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!"

(Judges 6:23) 
And the Lord said to him: "Peace be with you. Do not fear; you will not die."

(Judges 6:24) 
So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and he called it "The Lord is Peace" (Yahweh Shalom), even to this present day. This occurred while he was still in Ephra, which belonged to the family of Ezri.

(Judges 6:25) 
That same night, the Lord said to him: "Take a bull from your father's herd, and another bull that is seven years old. Then tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the sacred grove of trees that is around it."

(Judges 6:26) 
"And build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, the very one upon which you made your offering earlier. Then, using the wood that you cut down from the sacred grove, offer a burnt offering."

(Judges 6:27) 
So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did just as the Lord had commanded him. But because he was afraid of his father's household and the men of that city, he would not do it by day; instead, he completed everything during the night.

(Judges 6:28) 
And when the men of his city rose early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred grove cut down, and a bull offered as a sacrifice on the altar that had just been built.

(Judges 6:29) 
And they said to one another: "Who did this?" And when they investigated to find the one responsible for the deed, it was said: "Gideon, the son of Joas, did all these things."

(Judges 6:30) 
And they said to Joas: "Bring out your son here, so that he may die, because he destroyed the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred grove."

(Judges 6:31) 
But Joas responded to them: "Are you going to avenge Baal and fight for him? Whoever opposes him, let him die before tomorrow's light arrives. If Baal is a god, let him avenge himself on the one who tore down his altar."

(Judges 6:32) 
From that day forward, Gideon was called Jerobaal, which means "Baal Contends," because Joas had said: "Let Baal contend with him, because he tore down his altar."

(Judges 6:33) 
Then all of Midian, and Amalek, and the peoples from the East gathered together. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.

(Judges 6:34) 
But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, strengthening him for battle. And Gideon blew the trumpet, summoning the house of Abiezer to follow him.

(Judges 6:35) 
He also sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, and they too followed him. And he sent others into Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came to meet him.

(Judges 6:36) 
And Gideon said to the Lord: "If You truly intend to save Israel by my hand, as You have spoken,

(Judges 6:37) 
behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and the ground all around it is dry, then I will know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken."

(Judges 6:38) 
And it happened just so. For when Gideon rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung out enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.

(Judges 6:39) 
And Gideon said again to the Lord: "Do not let your anger burn against me, Lord, if I try just one more time, seeking a sign with the fleece. I pray that only the fleece may be dry this time, and all the ground around it be wet with dew."

(Judges 6:40) 
And God did so that night as he had requested. Only the fleece was dry, and all the ground around it was covered with dew.

(Judges 6:1) 
The children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord gave them into the power of Midian for seven years.

(Judges 6:2) 
The Midianites severely oppressed them, and they gained complete dominance over Israel.

(Judges 6:3) 
Whenever Israel had planted their crops, Midian, Amalek, and the other Eastern peoples would invade.

(Judges 6:4) 
They would establish their camps against Israel, and they would eat up everything that was sown in the land, all the way to Gaza. Nothing would be left in Israel for sustenance, neither for their livestock, nor sheep, nor cattle.

(Judges 6:5) 
For all of them would come with their flocks and their tents, like a multitude of locusts. As they swarmed in, they would devastate everything.

(Judges 6:6) 
So Israel was greatly humbled and brought low before Midian.

(Judges 6:7) 
And Israel cried out to the Lord, pleading for help against the Midianites.

(Judges 6:8) 
The Lord sent a prophet to them, who spoke these words: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I caused you to come up out of Egypt, and I led you out of the house of slavery.'

(Judges 6:9) 
'I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your enemies. I drove them out from before you, and I gave you their land.'

(Judges 6:10) 
'And I said: I am the Lord your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed my voice.'

(Judges 6:11) 
Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree which was in Ephra, and which belonged to Joas, of the family of Ezri. His son, Gideon, was threshing and cleaning wheat in a winepress, so that he could hide it from the Midianites.

(Judges 6:12) 
The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: 'The Lord is with you, O mightiest of warriors!'

(Judges 6:13) 
Gideon then said to him: 'Please, my Lord, if the Lord is with us, why has all this trouble come upon us? Where are all His wondrous works, which our fathers told us about, saying: "The Lord brought us out of Egypt"? But now the Lord has abandoned us and delivered us into the power of Midian.'

(Judges 6:14) 
The Lord looked at him and said: 'Go in this strength of yours, and you shall deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Know for certain that I Myself have sent you.'

(Judges 6:15) 
Gideon replied: 'Please, my Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the humblest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.'

(Judges 6:16) 
The Lord then said to him: 'I will be with you. You shall strike down Midian as if they were a single man.'

(Judges 6:17) 
Gideon said: 'If I have found favor in your sight, then give me a sign that it is truly you who speaks with me.'

(Judges 6:18) 
'Do not leave here until I return to you, bringing my offering and presenting it to you.' The Angel replied: 'I will wait for your return.'

(Judges 6:19) 
So Gideon went in and cooked a young goat, and from a measure of flour he made unleavened bread. He put the meat in a basket and poured the broth out into a pot separately. He brought it all out under the oak tree and offered it to the Angel.

(Judges 6:20) 
The Angel of the Lord said to him: 'Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them upon that rock, and pour the broth over them.' When Gideon had done so,

(Judges 6:21) 
the Angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that He held in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire then rose from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.

(Judges 6:22) 
When Gideon saw that it was indeed the Angel of the Lord, he cried out: 'Alas for me, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!'

(Judges 6:23) 
But the Lord said to him: 'Peace be with you. Do not be afraid. You shall not die.'

(Judges 6:24) 
So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and he called it 'The Lord is Peace' (or 'Yahweh Shalom'). It stands even to this present day in Ephra, where the family of Ezri lives.

(Judges 6:25) 
On that very night, the Lord said to Gideon: 'Take your father's bull, and another bull that is seven years old. Tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the sacred grove that is around it.'

(Judges 6:26) 
'Then build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, upon which you previously placed your offering. Take the wood from the sacred grove that you have cut down, and offer a burnt offering.'

(Judges 6:27) 
So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had commanded him. However, because he was afraid of his father's household and the men of that city, he did not want to do it by day. Instead, he made sure to complete everything by night.

(Judges 6:28) 
When the men of the city rose early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal was torn down, the sacred grove was cut down, and the bull had been offered as a sacrifice on the altar that had just been built.

(Judges 6:29) 
They said to one another: 'Who did this?' When they inquired diligently to find the one who had done it, it was told to them: 'Gideon, the son of Joas, did all these things.'

(Judges 6:30) 
They then said to Joas: 'Bring out your son so that he may die! For he has torn down the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred grove!'

(Judges 6:31) 
Joas answered those who were speaking against him: 'Will you fight for Baal? Will you contend on his behalf? Whoever stands up for him shall die before morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself against the one who destroyed his altar!'

(Judges 6:32) 
From that day on, Gideon was called Jerobaal (which means, 'Let Baal contend'), because Joas had said: 'Let Baal contend with him, since he tore down his altar.'

(Judges 6:33) 
Then all of Midian, Amalek, and the peoples of the East gathered together. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the valley of Jezrael.

(Judges 6:34) 
But the Spirit of the Lord empowered Gideon. He sounded the trumpet, calling the household of Abiezer to follow him.

(Judges 6:35) 
He also sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came out to meet him.

(Judges 6:36) 
Gideon then said to God: 'If you are truly going to save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,'

(Judges 6:37) 
'I will place this fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and all the ground around it is dry, then I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.'

(Judges 6:38) 
And so it happened. When he rose early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and found a bowl full of dew.

(Judges 6:39) 
Gideon spoke to God again: 'Do not be angry with me, Lord, if I test you just one more time, seeking a sign with the fleece. Let only the fleece be dry, and let all the surrounding ground be wet with dew.'

(Judges 6:40) 
And God did so that night as Gideon had requested. Only the fleece was dry, and there was dew on all the ground around it.

(Judges 7:1) 
Jerubbaal, who was also called Gideon, and all the people with him rose during the night. They then set up their camp next to the Spring of Harad. The Midianite camp was located to the north of them, visible in the valley before them.

(Judges 7:2) 
Then the Lord spoke to Gideon, saying: 'The people with you are too numerous. I will not hand Midian over to them, lest Israel boast against me and say: "I was delivered by my own strength."

(Judges 7:3) 
Now, speak to the people and proclaim in everyone's hearing: 'Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return home.' So, twenty-two thousand men returned from Mount Galaad, and ten thousand remained.

(Judges 7:4) 
And the Lord said to Gideon: 'There are still too many people. Lead them down to the waters, and there I will test them. Concerning whomever I tell you, "This one shall go with you," that one shall go. But whomever I forbid, that one shall return home.'

(Judges 7:5) 
When he had led them down to the waters, the Lord said to Gideon: 'All who lap up the waters with their tongues, just as dogs lap, you shall separate them to one side. Likewise, do the same for every one who kneels to drink.'

(Judges 7:6) 
So, the number of those who lapped from their hand to their mouth was three hundred men. However, all the rest of the multitude had knelt on their knees to drink.

(Judges 7:7) 
And the Lord said to Gideon: 'With these three hundred men who lapped the waters, I will deliver you and give Midian into your hand. But all the rest of the multitude shall return to their homes.'

(Judges 7:8) 
So, Gideon took the provisions and all the armor from the rest of the men. He then ordered all the other Israelites to return to their tents, while he himself, with the three hundred men, prepared for battle. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.

(Judges 7:9) 
That same night, the Lord said to him: 'Arise and go down into the camp, for I have delivered them into your hand.'

(Judges 7:10) 
But if you are afraid to go down alone, then go down with Phara, your servant.

(Judges 7:11) 
And when you hear what they are saying, then your hands will be strengthened, and you will go down to the battle more confidently. So, he himself and Phara, his servant, went down to the part of the camp where the armed scouts were stationed.

(Judges 7:12) 
Now, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the peoples from the East were spread out in the valley, as numerous as a swarm of locusts. Their camels were also innumerable, like the sand that lies on the seashore.

(Judges 7:13) 
When Gideon arrived, he heard someone telling a dream to his companion. Among other things they were conversing about, this man recounted: 'I saw a dream. It seemed to me as if a barley loaf of bread was rolling down and came into the camp of Midian. And when it reached a tent, it struck it and overturned it, completely throwing it down.'

(Judges 7:14) 
The man to whom he was speaking answered, saying: 'This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon, the son of Joas, a man of Israel! The Lord has delivered Midian and all its camp into his hands.'

(Judges 7:15) 
And when Gideon had heard the dream and its interpretation, he immediately worshiped God. He then returned to the camp of Israel and said: 'Arise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into our hands!'

(Judges 7:16) 
He divided the three hundred men into three companies. To all of them, he gave trumpets in their hands, empty jars, and torches inside the jars.

(Judges 7:17) 
And he said to them: 'Whatever you see me do, that is what you are to do. Follow your leader. Act exactly as I act.'

(Judges 7:18) 
When I blow the trumpet, then you also, all around the camp, are to blow. And you are to say: 'The Lord's and Gideon's!'

(Judges 7:19) 
So, Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him entered the part of the camp just after the middle watch of the night, right after the first guards had been stationed. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars they held among themselves.

(Judges 7:20) 
When the trumpets had sounded in the three places, and the jars were broken, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands, shouting: 'The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!'

(Judges 7:21) 
Every man stood in his place all around the camp of Midian. All those in the camp were thrown into confusion, shouting and fleeing in terror.

(Judges 7:22) 
And with only the three hundred men sounding their trumpets, the Lord turned every man's sword against his fellow, and they were slaughtered by mutual killing. They fled as far as Beth-shettah, and to the edge of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath.

(Judges 7:23) 
Then, Israel, with men from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, were called out and pursued Midian.

(Judges 7:24) 
And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying: 'Come down to meet Midian and seize the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River.' So, all of Ephraim was called out, and they seized the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.

(Judges 7:25) 
They captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeb at the Winepress of Zeb. And while they pressed Gideon from Midian, they cut off the heads of Oreb and Zeb and brought them to Gideon across the Jordan.

(Judges 7:1) 
So Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, rose very early, and his entire army with him. They set up their camp near the spring of Harod. The Midianite camp, by contrast, was to the north, in the valley known for its prominence.

(Judges 7:2) 
The Lord then said to Gideon, "You have too many men with you. I will not hand the Midianites over to such a large army, because if I did, the people of Israel might boast against me, saying, 'We saved ourselves by our own strength!'"

(Judges 7:3) 
"Therefore, speak to the people and make this declaration for everyone to hear: 'Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn back now.'" So, twenty-two thousand men returned from Mount Gilead, leaving only ten thousand behind.

(Judges 7:4) 
The Lord spoke to Gideon again, saying, "There are still too many men. Lead them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Those about whom I tell you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go. But everyone about whom I tell you, 'This one shall not go,' shall return."

(Judges 7:5) 
So when Gideon led the men down to the water, the Lord said to him, "Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set aside by himself. Also, set aside everyone who kneels down to drink."

(Judges 7:6) 
The number of men who lapped the water by bringing it to their mouths with their hands was three hundred. All the remaining men in the army drank by kneeling down.

(Judges 7:7) 
And the Lord said to Gideon, "With these three hundred men who lapped the water, I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the rest of the army return to their own homes."

(Judges 7:8) 
So Gideon took the provisions for the remaining people, as well as their trumpets, and sent all the rest of the Israelites back to their tents. Gideon himself, with only the three hundred men, prepared for battle. The Midianite camp was situated below them in the valley.

(Judges 7:9) 
That very night, the Lord said to Gideon, "Get up! Go down into the enemy camp, for I have already delivered them into your hands."

(Judges 7:10) 
"However, if you are afraid to go down by yourself, then go down with your servant, Pharah."

(Judges 7:11) 
"And when you hear what they are saying, then your hands will be strengthened, and you will go into battle with more confidence." So Gideon and his servant Pharah went down to the edge of the camp where the armed guards were positioned.

(Judges 7:12) 
The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the peoples from the East were spread out across the valley, as numerous as a swarm of locusts. Their camels were likewise countless, like the grains of sand on the seashore.

(Judges 7:13) 
When Gideon reached the camp, he heard one man telling his neighbor a dream. The man was saying, "I had a dream, and behold, a humble loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp, struck a tent, and completely overturned it to the ground!"

(Judges 7:14) 
The man he was speaking to replied, "This dream can mean nothing other than the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, an Israelite man! God the Lord has delivered Midian and their entire army into his hands."

(Judges 7:15) 
When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he immediately worshipped God. He then returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise! For the Lord has delivered the Midianite camp into our hands!"

(Judges 7:16) 
Gideon divided the three hundred men into three separate companies. He gave each man a trumpet, an empty pitcher, and a torch to be hidden inside the pitcher.

(Judges 7:17) 
And he said to them, "Watch me carefully, and do exactly as I do. When I go to the edge of the enemy camp, whatever I do there, you must imitate."

(Judges 7:18) 
"When my trumpet sounds, along with the trumpets of everyone with me, then you also, all around the camp, must blow your trumpets and shout, 'A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!'"

(Judges 7:19) 
So Gideon and the three hundred men with him entered the enemy camp just as the middle watch of the night was beginning, right after the guards had been posted. Immediately, they blew their trumpets and smashed the pitchers, revealing the bright torches.

(Judges 7:20) 
and they all cried out, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!"

(Judges 7:21) 
Each man stood in his position surrounding the enemy camp. All the Midianite soldiers were utterly terrified, crying out and fleeing in confusion.

(Judges 7:22) 
As the three hundred men kept blowing their trumpets, the Lord caused all the Midianite soldiers in the camp to turn their swords against one another and strike each other down with mutual wounds.

(Judges 7:23) 
Then, the men of Israel from Naphtali, Asher, and all of Manasseh, who had previously been sent home, were called to gather and pursue the fleeing Midianites.

(Judges 7:24) 
Gideon also sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down to intercept the Midianites and seize the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River!" So, all the men of Ephraim gathered together with a great cry and secured the water crossings of the Jordan.

(Judges 7:25) 
They captured two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeb at the Winepress of Zeb. Then, continuing their pursuit of the Midianites, they brought the severed heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gideon, who was waiting beyond the Jordan River.

(Judges 8:1) 
Then the men of Ephraim came to Gideon, very angry. They demanded of him, "What is this action you have taken? You did not call us to come with you when you went to fight against Midian!" They strongly argued with him and criticized him.

(Judges 8:2) 
Gideon responded to them: "What have I done that could compare to what you have accomplished? Is not the gleaning done by Ephraim better than the full harvest of Abiezer?"

(Judges 8:3) 
God Himself delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeb, into your hands! How could anything I have done compare to that great deed of yours? After Gideon spoke this, their anger towards him subsided.

(Judges 8:4) 
Gideon then reached the Jordan River and crossed it, along with the three hundred men who were with him. They were all exhausted but still in pursuit of the enemy.

(Judges 8:5) 
He said to the men of Succoth: "Please give bread to the people who are with me, because they are weary. This way we can continue to pursue Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian, who are still fleeing."

(Judges 8:6) 
But the officials of Succoth replied: "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your power? Are they already captured? How can we give food to your army now?"

(Judges 8:7) 
Gideon answered: "Because of this, when the Lord delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will crush your flesh with thorns and thistles from the wilderness."

(Judges 8:8) 
From there, he went up to Penuel and spoke to its men in the same manner. The men of Penuel also gave him the same reply as the men of Succoth.

(Judges 8:9) 
So Gideon told them as well: "When I return victorious, I will tear down this tower of yours."

(Judges 8:10) 
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were resting with their entire army, which numbered fifteen thousand men. These were all that remained from the vast camp of the Midianites, as one hundred twenty thousand warriors had already been killed.

(Judges 8:11) 
Gideon went up by the route of the tent-dwellers, to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah. He struck the enemy camp when they felt secure and unsuspecting.

(Judges 8:12) 
Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but Gideon pursued them and captured them, having thrown their entire army into a panic.

(Judges 8:13) 
As Gideon returned from the battle, before sunrise,

(Judges 8:14) 
he seized a young man from the men of Succoth. He questioned him, asking for the names of the leaders and elders of Succoth, and the young man wrote down seventy-seven men.

(Judges 8:15) 
Then Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said: "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna! These are the men concerning whom you mocked me, saying: 'Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your grasp, that we should give bread to your weary men?'"

(Judges 8:16) 
So Gideon took the elders of the city, along with thorns and thistles from the wilderness. With these, he punished and taught the men of Succoth a painful lesson.

(Judges 8:17) 
He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the inhabitants of that city.

(Judges 8:18) 
Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna: "What kind of men were those whom you killed at Tabor?" They replied: "They were like you, each one appearing as a king's son."

(Judges 8:19) 
Gideon said to them: "They were my sons, my own brothers, whom you murdered! As the Lord lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you now."

(Judges 8:20) 
Then he turned to Jether, his firstborn son, and said: "Arise, and kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still a mere boy.

(Judges 8:21) 
Zebah and Zalmunna then said to Gideon: "You yourself, arise and kill us. For a man's strength is according to his age." So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the ornaments from the necks of their camels.

(Judges 8:22) 
Then all the men of Israel said to Gideon: "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson, because you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."

(Judges 8:23) 
But Gideon said to them: "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord alone will rule over you."

(Judges 8:24) 
And Gideon said to them: "I have one request to make of you. Give me the earrings from your plunder." (For the Ishmaelites, who were the Midianites, were accustomed to wearing golden earrings.)

(Judges 8:25) 
They replied: "We will gladly give them!" So they spread out a cloak, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder.

(Judges 8:26) 
The weight of the golden earrings that Gideon had requested was seventeen hundred shekels of gold. This was besides the ornate crescents, pendants, and purple garments that the kings of Midian usually wore, and also the chains from the camels' necks.

(Judges 8:27) 
Gideon made an ephod from this gold and placed it in his city, Ophrah. All of Israel committed spiritual adultery by worshiping it there, and it became a snare and ruin for Gideon and his entire household.

(Judges 8:28) 
So Midian was humbled before the sons of Israel and could no longer lift their heads in pride. The land enjoyed peace for forty years, throughout the time Gideon governed them.

(Judges 8:29) 
Then Jerubbaal, who was Gideon the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.

(Judges 8:30) 
Gideon had seventy sons, who were his direct offspring, for he had many wives.

(Judges 8:31) 
His concubine, whom he kept in Shechem, also bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.

(Judges 8:32) 
Gideon, the son of Joash, died at a good old age. He was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the family of the Abiezrites.

(Judges 8:33) 
After Gideon died, the sons of Israel turned away from God and committed spiritual adultery with the Baals. They established a covenant with Baal-berith, promising to worship him as their god.

(Judges 8:34) 
They did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their surrounding enemies.

(Judges 8:35) 
Nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good he had done for Israel.

(Judges 8:1) 
The men of Ephraim said to Gideon, "What is this thing you have done? You did not call us when you went out to fight against Midian." And they argued with him very vehemently because of this.

(Judges 8:2) 
To them, he replied, "What could I have done that was like what you have done? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the full harvest of Abiezer?"

(Judges 8:3) 
God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeb. What could I have done that was like what you have accomplished? When he had spoken these words, their anger, with which they had been swelling, subsided.

(Judges 8:4) 
Gideon then came to the Jordan River, and he crossed over, along with the three hundred men who were with him. They were exhausted and hungry.

(Judges 8:5) 
And he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give bread to the people who are with me, because they are faint and extremely hungry. I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."

(Judges 8:6) 
The princes of Succoth replied, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your power, that we should give bread to your army?"

(Judges 8:7) 
Gideon said, "Because of this, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and thistles of the wilderness."

(Judges 8:8) 
From there, he also went up to Penuel and spoke to them in a similar way. The men of Penuel responded to him just as the men of Succoth had replied.

(Judges 8:9) 
And he also said to them, "When I return victorious, I will destroy this tower."

(Judges 8:10) 
Zebah and Zalmunna, however, were resting with their entire army, all fifteen thousand men who remained of all the eastern forces. Indeed, one hundred twenty thousand fighting men had already been slain.

(Judges 8:11) 
And Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents, on the east side of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he struck the enemy's camp, because they felt secure.

(Judges 8:12) 
Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and Gideon pursued them and captured them, throwing their entire army into confusion.

(Judges 8:13) 
Gideon returned from the battle before the sun rose.

(Judges 8:14) 
He seized a young man from the men of Succoth and questioned him about the names of the princes and elders of Succoth. The young man wrote down seventy-seven men.

(Judges 8:15) 
Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your power, that we should give bread to your weary men?'"

(Judges 8:16) 
So he took the elders of the city, and the thorns and thistles of the wilderness, and with them, he threshed and crushed the men of Succoth.

(Judges 8:17) 
He also pulled down the tower of Penuel, killing its inhabitants.

(Judges 8:18) 
And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men were those whom you killed at Tabor?" They replied, "They were like you, each one appearing like a son of a king."

(Judges 8:19) 
To them, he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had spared them, I would not kill you now."

(Judges 8:20) 
Then he said to Jether, his firstborn son, "Rise and kill them." But he did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still a boy.

(Judges 8:21) 
Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and kill us, for a man's strength is according to his age." So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the ornaments and the golden chains from their camels.

(Judges 8:22) 
Then all the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you, and your son, and your grandson, because you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."

(Judges 8:23) 
To them, he said, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord alone will rule over you."

(Judges 8:24) 
And he said to them, "I have one request to ask of you: give me the earrings from your plunder." For the Ishmaelites had golden earrings.

(Judges 8:25) 
They replied, "We will gladly give them." Spreading out a cloak, they each threw into it the earrings they had been able to seize.

(Judges 8:26) 
The weight of the golden earrings that he had requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the ornaments, necklaces, and the purple garments that the kings of Midian had worn, and the chains from the camels.

(Judges 8:27) 
Gideon made an ephod from it and placed it in his city, Ophrah. And all of Israel prostituted themselves after it—worshipping this idol—and it became a ruin for Gideon and for all his house.

(Judges 8:28) 
So Midian was humbled before the sons of Israel, and they could not lift up their heads any longer. And the land had rest for forty years, during the time Gideon ruled.

(Judges 8:29) 
So Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.

(Judges 8:30) 
He had seventy sons who were born from his own body, for he had many wives.

(Judges 8:31) 
And his concubine, whom he had in Shechem, bore him a son named Abimelech.

(Judges 8:32) 
Gideon, the son of Joash, died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the family of Abiezrites.

(Judges 8:33) 
After Gideon died, the sons of Israel turned away and prostituted themselves after the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god.

(Judges 8:34) 
They did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies all around them.

(Judges 8:35) 
Nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good that he had done for them.

(Judges 8:36) 
At that time, Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem, to the brothers of his mother, and spoke to them and to all the relatives of his mother's family, saying:

(Judges 8:37) 
"Which is better for you: that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you? Consider also that I am your bone and your flesh."

(Judges 8:38) 
The brothers of his mother spoke concerning him all these words to all the men of Shechem, and they inclined their hearts toward Abimelech, saying, "He is our brother."

(Judges 8:39) 
They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith. With this money, he hired worthless and reckless men, and they followed him.

(Judges 8:40) 
Then he came to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal—seventy men—on one stone. Only Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, remained alive, because he had hidden himself.

(Judges 9:1) 
Abimelech, who was the son of Jerubaal, went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers. He spoke to them and to all the family of his mother’s father, saying:

(Judges 9:2) 
“Tell the men of Shechem to listen carefully to what I say: Which is better for you—that seventy men rule over you, all the sons of Jerubaal, or that one man rule over you? Also, remind them that I am your own flesh and blood, your brother.”

(Judges 9:3) 
His mother’s brothers then spoke all these words about Abimelech to all the men of Shechem. And the hearts of the men of Shechem were inclined toward Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother, after all.”

(Judges 9:4) 
And so they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith. With this silver, Abimelech hired worthless and wandering men, and they followed him.

(Judges 9:5) 
Abimelech then went to his father’s house in Ophrah. There, on a single stone, he killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubaal. Only Jotham, Jerubaal’s youngest son, remained alive because he had hidden himself.

(Judges 9:6) 
So all the men of Shechem and all the families of the city of Millo gathered together. They went and made Abimelech king beside the oak tree that stood in Shechem.

(Judges 9:7) 
When this was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He raised his voice and cried out, saying, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and may God listen to you!”

(Judges 9:8) 
“Once, the trees went out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree: ‘Rule over us.’

(Judges 9:9) 
But the olive tree answered: ‘Can I give up my oil, by which both God and men are honored, and go to wave over the other trees?’

(Judges 9:10) 
Then the trees said to the fig tree: ‘Come, you, and rule over us.’

(Judges 9:11) 
But the fig tree answered them: ‘Can I give up my sweetness and my excellent fruit, and go to wave over the other trees?’

(Judges 9:12) 
Then the trees spoke to the vine: ‘Come, and rule over us.’

(Judges 9:13) 
But the vine answered: ‘Can I give up my wine, which gladdens both God and men, and go to wave over the other trees?’

(Judges 9:14) 
Then all the trees said to the bramble: ‘Come, and rule over us.’

(Judges 9:15) 
And the bramble answered them: ‘If you truly wish to anoint me as your king, then come and rest in my shadow. But if not, then let fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’

(Judges 9:16) 
“Now then, if you have acted with sincerity and truth, and have dealt well with Jerubaal and his household, and have given him a fitting reward for the injuries he endured from you —

(Judges 9:17) 
he who fought for you, who put his life in danger to deliver you from the hand of Midian —

(Judges 9:18) 
and yet you have risen up today against my father’s household, and have killed his seventy sons upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, simply because he is your brother —

(Judges 9:19) 
if therefore you have acted with sincerity and truth today with Jerubaal and his household, then rejoice today in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.

(Judges 9:20) 
But if you have not, then let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the inhabitants of Shechem and the house of Millo. And let fire come out from Shechem and from the house of Millo and consume Abimelech.”

(Judges 9:21) 
When Jotham had finished cursing them, he fled to Beer, and he stayed there because of his brother Abimelech.

(Judges 9:22) 
So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years.

(Judges 9:23) 
Then God sent an evil spirit to cause trouble between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Shechem. And the men of Shechem began to detest him.

(Judges 9:24) 
This happened so that the evil done against Jerubaal’s sons might come to pass, and their blood would be avenged upon Abimelech, their brother, and upon the other Shechemites who had helped him kill his brothers.

(Judges 9:25) 
And the men of Shechem set ambushes against him on the tops of the mountains. While they lay in wait for his coming, they committed robberies, taking plunder from those who passed by. This was reported to Abimelech.

(Judges 9:26) 
But then Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brothers and moved into Shechem. At his arrival, the inhabitants of Shechem were encouraged.

(Judges 9:27) 
They went out into the fields, harvested their vineyards, and trod the grapes in the winepresses. They then held feasts, and entering the temple of their god, they ate and drank together, and they cursed Abimelech.

(Judges 9:28) 
Gaal, the son of Ebed, cried out: “Who is Abimelech, and who are we in Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubaal? And isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor, the founder of Shechem! Why should we serve this man?

(Judges 9:29) 
If only I were given charge of this people, I would remove Abimelech! I would then say to Abimelech: ‘Gather your army and come out!’”

(Judges 9:30) 
When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Ebed, he became very angry.

(Judges 9:31) 
He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying: “Look, Gaal, the son of Ebed, has come to Shechem with his brothers, and he is stirring up the city against you.

(Judges 9:32) 
Therefore, rise up at night with your people and lie in wait in the fields.

(Judges 9:33) 
At first light, as the sun rises, rush upon the city. And when Gaal and his people come out against you, then do to him whatever you can.”

(Judges 9:34) 
So Abimelech rose up at night with all his army, and they set ambushes near Shechem in four companies.

(Judges 9:35) 
And Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and all the army with him rose up from their ambush.

(Judges 9:36) 
Gaal saw the people and said to Zebul: “Look, a multitude is coming down from the mountains!” But Zebul answered him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men’s heads, and you are being deceived by this error.”

(Judges 9:37) 
Again, Gaal said: “Look, troops are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming by the road that looks toward the Diviners’ Oak.”

(Judges 9:38) 
Then Zebul said to him: “Where is your mouth now, with which you said: ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Is this not the very people you despised? Go out now and fight against him!”

(Judges 9:39) 
So Gaal went out, with the people of the city watching, and fought against Abimelech.

(Judges 9:40) 
But Abimelech pursued him. Gaal was put to flight and wounded, and many dead bodies lay slaughtered all the way to the city gate.

(Judges 9:1) 
Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to his mother's brothers. He spoke to them and to all the relatives of his mother's household, saying:

(Judges 9:2) 
"Please, speak to all the leaders of Shechem: Which is better for you: that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rules over you? Remember also that I am your own flesh and blood."

(Judges 9:3) 
So his mother's brothers spoke all these words about him to all the leaders of Shechem. Their hearts were swayed to follow Abimelech, for they said: "He is our own flesh and blood, our brother."

(Judges 9:4) 
Then they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the treasury of the temple of Baalphakor. With this money, he hired worthless and vagrant men, and they followed him.

(Judges 9:5) 
He went to his father's house in Ephra and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Joatham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, remained alive, because he had hidden himself.

(Judges 9:6) 
Then all the men of Shechem and all the citizens of the city of Mello gathered together. They went and made Abimelech their king beside the oak tree that stood in Shechem.

(Judges 9:7) 
When this was told to Joatham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Garizim. He raised his voice and cried out, saying: "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and may God listen to you."

(Judges 9:8) 
"The trees once went out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Rule over us!'"

(Judges 9:9) 
"But the olive tree answered: 'Can I truly leave my rich oil, which both God and men use, to go and be exalted among the trees?'"

(Judges 9:10) 
"Then the trees said to the fig tree: 'Come and rule over us!'"

(Judges 9:11) 
"But the fig tree answered: 'Can I truly leave my sweetness and my excellent fruits to go and be moved about among the other trees?'"

(Judges 9:12) 
"So the trees spoke to the grapevine: 'Come and rule over us!'"

(Judges 9:13) 
"But the grapevine answered: 'Can I truly leave my wine, which makes God and men joyful, to go and serve among the other trees?'"

(Judges 9:14) 
"Then all the trees said to the bramble: 'Come and rule over us!'"

(Judges 9:15) 
"And the bramble answered them: 'If you truly want to make me your king, then come and take shelter in my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'"

(Judges 9:16) 
"Now therefore, if you have acted rightly and without sin by making Abimelech your king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his household, and if you have repaid him for the good deeds he did for you, for he fought for you,"

(Judges 9:17) 
"and risked his own life to deliver you from the power of Midian,"

(Judges 9:18) 
"yet you have risen up against my father's household today and killed his seventy sons on one stone. You have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, simply because he is your brother."

(Judges 9:19) 
"If, then, you have acted justly and without sin towards Jerubbaal and his household today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you."

(Judges 9:20) 
"But if you have acted wickedly, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and the city of Mello. And let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the city of Mello and consume Abimelech!"

(Judges 9:21) 
After Joatham had cried out these words, he fled and went to Bera, and lived there, fearing Abimelech, his brother.

(Judges 9:22) 
So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years.

(Judges 9:23) 
Then the Lord sent a destructive spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Shechem. They began to betray him.

(Judges 9:24) 
This was so that the wickedness of killing the seventy sons of Jerubbaal would come upon them. Their blood would be avenged upon Abimelech, their brother who had killed them, and upon the men of Shechem who had helped him in his deeds.

(Judges 9:25) 
The men of Shechem set up ambushes against him on the mountain peaks. While they waited for people in the passes, they committed robbery with no one stopping them.

(Judges 9:26) 
Now Gaal, the son of Obed, came with his brothers and moved into Shechem. The inhabitants of Shechem welcomed him.

(Judges 9:27) 
They went out into the fields, plundered the vineyards, and trampled the winepresses. They then held feasts in the temple of their god, eating and drinking together, and they cursed Abimelech.

(Judges 9:28) 
Then Gaal, the son of Obed, cried out: "Who is Abimelech, and who are we in Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal? And isn't Zebul his servant? Serve the men of Emor, the father of Shechem! Why should we serve him?"

(Judges 9:29) 
"If only this people were under my command, I would remove Abimelech from your midst!" He then dared Abimelech: "Gather your army and come!"

(Judges 9:30) 
When Zebul, the city's leader, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Obed, he became very angry.

(Judges 9:31) 
He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying: "Behold, Gaal, the son of Obed, has come to Shechem with his brothers and is stirring up the city against you."

(Judges 9:32) 
"Therefore, rise up at night with the people who are with you and lie in ambush in the field."

(Judges 9:33) 
"Then, at dawn, when the sun rises, rush upon the city. And when he and his people come out against you, do to him whatever you can."

(Judges 9:34) 
So Abimelech rose up with all his army by night and set ambushes near Shechem in four companies.

(Judges 9:35) 
Gaal, the son of Obed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and all the army with him rose up from their ambush.

(Judges 9:36) 
Gaal saw the people and said to Zebul: "Look! People are descending from the mountains!" Zebul answered him: "You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men's heads, and you are being deceived by this error."

(Judges 9:37) 
Again Gaal said: "Look, people are descending from the highest point of the land, and one company is coming by the road that looks towards the diviners' oak."

(Judges 9:38) 
Zebul answered him: "Where is your boasting now, when you said: 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the very people you despised? Go out now and fight against them!"

(Judges 9:39) 
So Gaal went out, leading the citizens of Shechem, and fought against Abimelech.

(Judges 9:40) 
Abimelech pursued him and put him to flight. Many fell wounded, all the way to the city gate.

(Judges 10:1) 
After these events, Thola arose as a new leader in the nation of Israel. He was the son of Phua, who was Abimelech's paternal uncle. Thola was a man from the tribe of Issachar, and he lived in Samir, in the mountains of Ephraim.

(Judges 10:2) 
He judged Israel for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Samir.

(Judges 10:3) 
After Thola, Jair the Galaadite arose. He judged Israel for twenty-two years.

(Judges 10:4) 
He had thirty sons, who rode on thirty donkey colts. He also possessed thirty cities, which were named after him, 'Havoth Jair.' These cities retain that name to the present day in the land of Galaad.

(Judges 10:5) 
Then Jair died and was buried in Camon.

(Judges 10:6) 
But the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. They served Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines. They abandoned the Lord and did not serve Him.

(Judges 10:7) 
So the Lord became angry with Israel and delivered them into the hands of the Philistines and the children of Ammon.

(Judges 10:8) 
For eighteen years, all the children of Israel who were beyond the Jordan—in the land of the Amorrhites, in Galaad—were afflicted and crushed.

(Judges 10:9) 
The oppression was so severe that they even crossed the Jordan and ravaged Juda, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel became greatly distressed.

(Judges 10:10) 
Then the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, 'We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken the Lord our God and have served Baalim.'

(Judges 10:11) 
And the Lord said to the children of Israel, 'Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorrhites, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines?'

(Judges 10:12) 
'When the Sidonians, Amalech, and the Chananæans oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand.'

(Judges 10:13) 
'Yet you have forsaken Me and served strange gods. Therefore, I will no longer deliver you.'

(Judges 10:14) 
'Go and invoke the gods whom you have chosen. Let them deliver you in the time of your distress.'

(Judges 10:15) 
Then the children of Israel said to the Lord, 'We have sinned; do to us whatever pleases You. Only deliver us now.'

(Judges 10:16) 
And they cast away the strange gods from their midst and served the Lord, who was moved by their miseries.

(Judges 10:17) 
Immediately, the children of Ammon were gathered together in Galaad and encamped there. When the children of Israel saw them, they also gathered in Maspha.

(Judges 10:18) 
And the princes of Galaad said, each to his neighbor, 'Whoever among us first begins to fight against the children of Ammon shall be the leader of the people of Galaad.'

(Judges 11:1) 
There was a man named Jephthah the Gileadite, a very strong warrior. He was the son of a prostitute woman, and Gilead was his father.

(Judges 11:2) 
But when Gilead’s lawful wife had borne sons, and these sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out. They said, 'You will not be allowed to inherit anything in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.'

(Judges 11:3) 
So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There, desperate men gathered to him, and they went out on raids with him.

(Judges 11:4) 
After many days passed, the Ammonites began to fight against Israel.

(Judges 11:5) 
As the Ammonites continued their advance, the elders of Gilead went to Jephthah in the land of Tob,

(Judges 11:6) 
and said to him, 'Come, and be our leader so you can fight against the Ammonites.'

(Judges 11:7) 
Jephthah answered them, 'Was it not you who hated me and drove me from my father’s house? Why have you come to me now, only when you are in trouble?'

(Judges 11:8) 
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'For this reason, we have indeed come to you now. If you go with us and fight against the Ammonites, you will be the head of all who live in Gilead.'

(Judges 11:9) 
Jephthah said to them, 'If you bring me back to fight for you against the Ammonites, and if the Lord gives them into my hand, then I will be your leader.'

(Judges 11:10) 
The princes of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'The Lord, who hears these things, will be the judge and witness of our agreement.'

(Judges 11:11) 
So Jephthah went with the princes of Gilead, and all the people made him their leader and commander. Then Jephthah repeated all his intentions and terms before the Lord in Mizpah.

(Judges 11:12) 
Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites with a message from him, saying: 'What conflict do you have with me, that you have come against me to lay waste my land?'

(Judges 11:13) 
The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah: 'Because Israel took my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan River. Now therefore, restore those lands to me peacefully.'

(Judges 11:14) 
Jephthah again sent messengers back to the king of the Ammonites,

(Judges 11:15) 
to tell him: 'This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab, nor the land of the Ammonites.'

(Judges 11:16) 
Instead, when they were coming out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and then came to Kadesh.

(Judges 11:17) 
Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Allow me to pass through your land.' But Edom’s king would not agree to their requests. They also sent to the king of Moab, who likewise denied them passage. So Israel remained in Kadesh.

(Judges 11:18) 
So Israel circled around the wilderness and all the land of Edom and Moab, and they came to the eastern side of the land of Moab. They camped beyond the Arnon River, because they did not want to enter the territory of Moab. Indeed, the Arnon forms the border between Moab and the Amorites.

(Judges 11:19) 
Therefore, Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and they said to him: 'Allow us to pass through your land to our own river.'

(Judges 11:20) 
But even Sihon, not trusting that Israel would merely pass through his territory, gathered a large army and came to Jahaz, where he resisted them.

(Judges 11:21) 
Then the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon with all his army into the hand of Israel, who struck him down and took possession of all the land of the Amorite inhabitants of that region.

(Judges 11:22) 
And all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the wilderness to the Jordan River.

(Judges 11:23) 
Therefore, the Lord God of Israel overthrew the Amorites, who dwelt in the land of Canaan, before His people Israel. And now, do you intend to possess it yourself?

(Judges 11:24) 
Do you not possess by right whatever your god Chemosh allows you to possess? So, whatever the Lord our God victoriously obtained, shall that not become our possession?

(Judges 11:25) 
Are you perhaps better than Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Or can you command anything against him?

(Judges 11:26) 
When Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan River, for three hundred years—why did you not attempt anything regarding this matter during all that time?

(Judges 11:27) 
Therefore, I have not sinned against you, but you are acting wickedly against me by bringing war upon me. May the Lord, the Judge, decide this day between Israel and the Ammonites.

(Judges 11:28) 
But the king of the Ammonites would not agree to the words that Jephthah had sent to him through messengers.

(Judges 11:29) 
Therefore, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he marched through Gilead and Manasseh, even Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he crossed over to the Ammonites.

(Judges 11:30) 
Then Jephthah made a solemn vow to the Lord, saying: 'If You will indeed deliver the Ammonites into my hands,'

(Judges 11:31) 
then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the Ammonites, will be a burnt offering to the Lord.'

(Judges 11:32) 
So Jephthah went over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hand.

(Judges 11:33) 
And he struck them down from Aroer all the way to Minnith, capturing twenty cities, and even to Abel-keramim, which was filled with vineyards, with an exceedingly great slaughter. Thus, the Ammonites were humbled before the Israelites.

(Judges 11:34) 
Now when Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah, his only daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dances, for she was the first to come to meet him. Indeed, she was his only daughter.

(Judges 11:35) 
When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried out: 'Alas, my daughter! You have truly undone me, and you yourself are undone, for I have opened my mouth with a vow to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it!'

(Judges 11:36) 
To him, she replied: 'My father, if you have opened your mouth to the Lord with a vow, then do to me whatever you have promised, since by this, the Lord’s vengeance has been fully accomplished against your enemies through you.'

(Judges 11:37) 
Then she said to her father: 'Grant me only this one thing that I ask: let me go for two months so I can wander the mountains and lament my virginity with my companions.'

(Judges 11:38) 
He replied to her, 'Go.' And he sent her away for two months. So she departed with her companions and bewailed her virginity in the mountains.

(Judges 11:39) 
When the two months were over, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never known a man. From that time on, a custom spread throughout Israel and became established:

(Judges 11:40) 
that after a year’s cycle, the daughters of Israel would gather together and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days.

(Judges 11:2) 
Gilead's legitimate wife bore him sons. When these sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away, telling him: "You cannot inherit anything in our father's house because your mother was a prostitute."

(Judges 11:3) 
So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There, desperate and impoverished men gathered around him and became his followers, engaging in raids with him.

(Judges 11:4) 
A short time later, the Ammonites began to wage war against the people of Israel.

(Judges 11:5) 
As the war intensified, the elders of Gilead went to the land of Tob to summon Jephthah back to them.

(Judges 11:6) 
They said to him: "Come and become our leader, and fight against the Ammonites for us."

(Judges 11:7) 
Jephthah replied to them: "Were you not the ones who hated me and drove me out from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, only when you are forced by necessity?"

(Judges 11:8) 
But they said to Jephthah: "For this very reason we have come to you now—so that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites, and you will become the head over all who live in Gilead."

(Judges 11:9) 
Jephthah then said to them: "If you have truly come to me so that I may fight for you against the Ammonites, and if the Lord hands the enemy into my power, will I truly be your leader?"

(Judges 11:10) 
They answered him: "The Lord, who hears these words, He Himself is the arbiter and witness, that what we have promised, we will fulfill in deed."

(Judges 11:11) 
So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and all the people made him their leader and commander. Jephthah then spoke all his solemn words and promises before the Lord in Mizpah.

(Judges 11:12) 
Jephthah then sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, to say in his name: "What dispute is between us, that you have come against me to lay waste to my land?"

(Judges 11:13) 
To them, the king of Ammon replied: "Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the borders of the Arnon River all the way to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River. Therefore, return it to me now peacefully."

(Judges 11:14) 
Jephthah, in turn, sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites.

(Judges 11:15) 
He commanded them to tell the Ammonite king: "Jephthah says this: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the Ammonites."

(Judges 11:16) 
"Instead, when they came out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and then they came to Kadesh."

(Judges 11:17) 
"Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: 'Allow me to pass through your land.' But he refused to agree to their requests. They also sent to the king of Moab, who likewise scorned to grant them passage. So Israel remained in Kadesh."

(Judges 11:18) 
"And so, Israel went around all the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and they came to the eastern side of the land of Moab. They camped beyond the Arnon River, and they did not wish to enter the territory of Moab, because the Arnon River was indeed the border of the land of Moab."

(Judges 11:19) 
"Therefore, Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and they said to him: 'Allow us to pass through your land all the way to the river.'"

(Judges 11:20) 
"But he also did not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his army, went out against them at Jahaz, and strongly resisted them in battle."

(Judges 11:21) 
"And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon with all his army into the hand of Israel. Israel defeated him and took possession of all the land of that region's Amorite inhabitants."

(Judges 11:22) 
"And they possessed all his territory, from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the wilderness to the Jordan River."

(Judges 11:23) 
"So then, the Lord God of Israel drove out the Amorites, with His people Israel fighting against them. And now you, Ammonites, want to take possession of their land, which is now ours?"

(Judges 11:24) 
"Do you not possess by right whatever Chemosh, your god, has given you? So also, what the Lord our God has victoriously obtained, shall pass into our possession."

(Judges 11:25) 
"Unless perhaps you are greater than Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, or you can command him to do something."

(Judges 11:26) 
"For three hundred years, Israel has lived in Heshbon and its surrounding villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan River. Why, during all this time, have you not attempted anything about this matter?"

(Judges 11:27) 
"Therefore, I have not sinned against you. Rather, you are acting wickedly against me by bringing unjust wars upon me. May the Lord, the Judge, decide today between Israel and the Ammonites."

(Judges 11:28) 
But the king of the Ammonites refused to listen to the words that Jephthah had sent to him through his messengers.

(Judges 11:29) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, empowering him. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.

(Judges 11:30) 
And Jephthah made a solemn vow to the Lord, saying: "If You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand,"

(Judges 11:31) 
"Then whoever comes out first from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites, that person I will offer up as a burnt offering to the Lord." This vow indicates a human sacrifice, a forbidden practice, which Jephthah misunderstands as pleasing to God.

(Judges 11:32) 
So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hand.

(Judges 11:33) 
He struck them down from Aroer all the way to Minnith, capturing twenty cities, and continuing as far as Abel-Keramim, which means "plain of the vineyards," inflicting an exceedingly great slaughter upon them. Thus, the Ammonites were subdued by the people of Israel.

(Judges 11:34) 
When Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah, his only daughter came out to meet him, celebrating with tambourines and dances. She was his only child; he had no other sons or daughters.

(Judges 11:35) 
When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried out: "Oh, my daughter! You have brought me to despair, and you yourself are in despair! I have opened my mouth in a solemn vow to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it."

(Judges 11:36) 
To him, she replied: "My father, if you have opened your mouth in a vow to the Lord, do to me whatever you have promised, since the Lord has granted you victory and vengeance over your enemies."

(Judges 11:37) 
She then said to her father: "Grant me only this one request: let me go for two months to wander among the mountains and mourn my virginity with my companions."

(Judges 11:38) 
He answered her: "Go." And he sent her away for two months. When she had gone with her companions, she wept over her virginity in the mountains.

(Judges 11:39) 
When the two months were completed, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She had known no man, remaining a virgin. From that time on, a custom prevailed in Israel and was observed:

(Judges 11:40) 
That year after year, the daughters of Israel would gather together and lament for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, for four days.

(Judges 12:1) 
The men from the tribe of Ephraim then gathered themselves and crossed to the northern region, confronting Jephthah. They demanded: "Why did you go to war against the Ammonites, and not call us to come with you? You will not get away with this insult to our honor; we will burn you and your entire household with fire!"

(Judges 12:2) 
Jephthah replied to them: "My people and I endured fierce battles against the Ammonites. And when I desperately called for your help, you did not provide any assistance."

(Judges 12:3) 
Seeing that you were unwilling to offer any assistance, I risked my life and went against the Ammonites. The Lord delivered them into my hands. Why, then, have you come today to fight against me?

(Judges 12:4) 
Jephthah then said to all the men of Gilead: "The conflict is now between me, all of you, and Ephraim. For they have said, 'You Gileadites are nothing but runaways from among Ephraim and Manasseh!'"

(Judges 12:5) 
Therefore, the Gileadites occupied all the fords of the Jordan River, through which the men of Ephraim were expected to return. When any man from Ephraim approached them there and said, "Please let me cross over,"

(Judges 12:6) 
The Gileadites would ask him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he answered, "No, I am not," they would say, "Then say 'Shibboleth'—"a word that means 'ear of grain'. If he pronounced it differently from how it sounded to their ears, he was immediately seized and killed at the Jordan River fords. At that time, forty-two thousand men from Ephraim died in this way.

(Judges 12:7) 
So Jephthah the Gileadite judged Israel for six years. Then he died and was buried in his city, Gilead.

(Judges 12:8) 
After him, Abesan from Bethlehem judged Israel.

(Judges 12:9) 
He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters out to be married, and brought wives for his sons from outside his family. He judged Israel for seven years.

(Judges 12:10) 
Then he died and was buried in Bethlehem.

(Judges 12:11) 
Ahialon the Zebulunite succeeded him and judged Israel for eight years.

(Judges 12:12) 
Then he died and was buried in Zebulun.

(Judges 12:13) 
After him, Abdon, the son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel.

(Judges 12:14) 
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, and they rode on seventy young donkeys—a sign of their wealth and status. He judged Israel for eight years.

(Judges 12:15) 
Then he died and was buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, on the mount of the Amalekites.

(Judges 13:1) 
The sons of Israel once again did evil in the sight of the Lord God. So He delivered them into the power of the Philistines for forty long years.

(Judges 13:2) 
Now there was a man from Zorah, from the tribe of Dan, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren, and she had not been able to bear any children.

(Judges 13:3) 
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah's wife and told her: "You are barren and without children, but you are going to conceive and give birth to a son."

(Judges 13:4) 
"Therefore, be careful not to drink any wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean."

(Judges 13:5) 
"For you will conceive and give birth to a son whose head no razor blade shall touch. This is because he will be a Nazirite, consecrated to the Lord God from his very birth, from his mother's womb. And he himself will begin to deliver Israel from the power of the Philistines."

(Judges 13:6) 
So the woman went and told her husband, saying: "A man of God came to me, with an angelic appearance, very awe-inspiring. When I asked him where he was from and what his name was, he refused to tell me."

(Judges 13:7) 
"Instead, he responded with this: 'Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from his mother's womb until the day of his death.'"

(Judges 13:8) 
So Manoah prayed to the Lord God, saying: "Oh, please, Lord, let the man of God whom You sent come to us again, and teach us what we ought to do for the boy who is about to be born."

(Judges 13:9) 
And the Lord God heard Manoah's prayer. Again, the angel of the Lord appeared to his wife while she was sitting in the field. But Manoah, her husband, was not with her.

(Judges 13:10) 
When she saw the angel, she hurried and ran to her husband, announcing to him: "Look, the man whom I saw before has appeared to me again!"

(Judges 13:11) 
Manoah arose and followed his wife. When they came to the man, Manoah asked him: "Are you the one who spoke with this woman?" And he answered: "I am."

(Judges 13:12) 
Manoah then asked him: "When your message is fulfilled, what do you want the boy to do? Or by what rules should he live?"

(Judges 13:13) 
The angel of the Lord answered Manoah: "From everything I told your wife, he must abstain."

(Judges 13:14) 
"Whatever comes from the grapevine he shall not eat. He must not drink wine or strong drink, and he shall not eat anything unclean. All that I commanded, he must observe."

(Judges 13:15) 
Manoah then said to the angel of the Lord: "Please, stay a little while, and we will prepare a young goat for you."

(Judges 13:16) 
The angel of the Lord answered him: "Even if you compel me, I will not eat your food. But if you wish to offer a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord God." Manoah did not realize that it was an angel of the Lord.

(Judges 13:17) 
Manoah then said to the angel of the Lord: "What is your name, so that when your message is fulfilled, we may honor you?"

(Judges 13:18) 
To this, he responded: "Why do you ask my name? It is wondrous, beyond understanding."

(Judges 13:19) 
So Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering, and he placed them on a rock, offering them to the Lord God, who performs wondrous acts.

(Judges 13:20) 
As the flame ascended from the altar toward the sky, the angel of the Lord also ascended in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell face down to the ground.

(Judges 13:21) 
The angel of the Lord did not appear to them again. Then Manoah understood that it had been an angel of the Lord.

(Judges 13:22) 
And he said to his wife: "We will surely die, because we have seen God."

(Judges 13:23) 
His wife responded to him: "If the Lord God had wished to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us what is to come."

(Judges 13:24) 
So the woman gave birth to a son, and she named him Samson. The boy grew, and the Lord God blessed him.

(Judges 13:25) 
And the Spirit of the Lord God began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

(Judges 14:1) 
Samson then went down to Timnah. There, he saw a young woman who was one of the daughters of the Philistines.

(Judges 14:2) 
He returned and told his father and his mother, saying: 'I saw a young woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. So now, get her for me as my wife.'

(Judges 14:3) 
His father and mother said to him: 'Is there not a young woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all your people, so that you would take a wife from among the uncircumcised Philistines?' But Samson said to his father: 'Get this one for me, because she pleases my eyes.'

(Judges 14:4) 
But his parents did not know that this was from the Lord, who was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. For at that time, the Philistines ruled over Israel.

(Judges 14:5) 
So Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When they came to the vineyards near the town, a young lion roared and sprang out against him.

(Judges 14:6) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Samson, and he tore the lion apart as if it were a young goat, even though he had nothing in his hand. He did not want to tell his father or his mother what he had done.

(Judges 14:7) 
He went down again and spoke with the young woman who had pleased his eyes.

(Judges 14:8) 
After some days, when he returned to take her as his wife, he turned aside to see the lion's carcass. And behold, there was a swarm of bees in the lion's mouth, and a honeycomb.

(Judges 14:9) 
When he had taken the honeycomb from the lion's body, he ate some as he walked. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate it. But he did not want to tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's body.

(Judges 14:10) 
So his father went down to the young woman's house. Samson then held a wedding feast there, for it was customary for young men to do so.

(Judges 14:11) 
When the local citizens saw him, they gave him thirty companions.

(Judges 14:12) 
Samson said to them: 'I will propose a riddle to you. If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast and tell me the correct answer, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.'

(Judges 14:13) 
'But if you cannot solve it, then you will give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.' They replied: 'Propose your riddle so we can hear it.'

(Judges 14:14) 
So he said to them: 'Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.' And they could not solve the riddle for three days.

(Judges 14:15) 
When the fourth day came, they said to Samson's wife: 'Coax your husband and get him to tell you what the riddle means. Otherwise, we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Were we invited to this wedding just to be impoverished?'

(Judges 14:16) 
So Samson's wife wept before him and said: 'You hate me and do not love me! That is why you have not told me the riddle you proposed to my countrymen!' He replied: 'I wouldn't even tell my own father and mother, so why should I tell you?'

(Judges 14:17) 
Yet she wept before him for the remaining seven days of the feast. At last, on the seventh day, overcome by her nagging, he told her. She immediately told all her countrymen the answer.

(Judges 14:18) 
So before the sun set on the seventh day, the men of the city said to him: 'What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?' He said to them: 'If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle.'

(Judges 14:19) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Samson, and he went down to Ashkelon. There, he killed thirty men. He took their spoils and gave their garments to those who had solved the riddle. Then, in a fit of intense rage, he returned to his father's house.

(Judges 14:20) 
But Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.

(Judges 14:21)

(Judges 14:40) 


(Judges 15:1) 
Now, after some time had passed, during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, bringing a young goat as a gift. And he said: 'I am going into my wife's room.' But her husband (Samson's father-in-law) did not allow him to.

(Judges 15:2) 
And her father-in-law, Samson's father-in-law, said: 'I thought you truly hated her, so I gave her to your friend. But look, her younger sister is more beautiful! Take her instead.'

(Judges 15:3) 
Samson replied: 'From this moment on, no Philistine can blame me for anything. I will certainly bring harm upon you people.'

(Judges 15:4) 
So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes. He then tied their tails together, two by two, and placed a torch between each pair of tied tails.

(Judges 15:5) 
He lit the torches, then released the foxes so they would run through the Philistine fields. Immediately, the crops caught fire—both the harvested grain that was already stacked, and the grain still standing in the stalks. Thus, the entire Philistine region was consumed by fire.

(Judges 15:6) 
The Philistines asked, 'Who did this?' They were told: 'Samson, the son-in-law of the man from Timnah, because he took Samson's wife and gave her to another man.' So the Philistines went up and killed her and her father by fire.

(Judges 15:7) 
Samson said to them: 'Since you have done such a cruel thing, I will not rest until I have had my revenge on you.'

(Judges 15:8) 
Then he struck them with a mighty blow, causing them to be crippled and fall. Afterward, he went down and stayed in the cave of the rock of Etam.

(Judges 15:9) 
Therefore, the Philistines went up into the land of Judah and camped at Lehi—which means 'Jawbone Hill'.

(Judges 15:10) 
The men of the tribe of Judah asked them: 'Why have you come up against us?' The Philistines answered: 'We have come to tie up Samson and make him pay for what he has done to us.'

(Judges 15:11) 
So three thousand men from Judah went down from the rock of Etam and said to Samson: 'Don't you know that the Philistines rule over us? Why did you want to do this to us?' He replied: 'Just as they did to me, so I did to them.'

(Judges 15:12) 
They said: 'We have come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.' Samson said to them: 'Swear to me that you yourselves will not kill me.'

(Judges 15:13) 
They responded: 'No, we will not kill you; we will only tie you up and hand you over.' So they tied him with two new ropes and took him from the rock of Etam.

(Judges 15:14) 
When he came to the place called Jawbone Hill, and the Philistines rushed to meet him, shouting in triumph, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly came upon Samson with overwhelming power. His ropes became like burned flax, which easily comes apart at the touch of fire. His bonds simply melted away from his hands.

(Judges 15:15) 
He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey lying there. Grabbing it, he used it to kill a thousand men.

(Judges 15:16) 
And Samson said: 'With the jawbone of a donkey, indeed, with the jawbone of a young donkey, I have killed a thousand men!'

(Judges 15:17) 
When he had finished speaking these words, he threw the jawbone from his hand and called that place Ramath-Lehi, which means 'Jawbone Elevation' or 'Hill of the Jawbone'.

(Judges 15:18) 
But then a terrible thirst oppressed him. He cried out to the Lord, saying: 'You, Lord, have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant. And now, look, I am dying of thirst and will fall into the hands of these uncircumcised enemies!'

(Judges 15:19) 
So the Lord opened a spring from a hollow place in the jawbone (or perhaps, a hollow in Lehi itself), and water flowed out from it. After Samson drank from it, his spirit was revived, and he regained his strength. Because of this, that place was called En-hakkore, meaning 'Spring of the One Who Calls,' which is at Jawbone Hill, even to this present day.

(Judges 15:20) 
And Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines' dominance.

(Judges 15:1) 
After some days had passed, when the wheat harvest was finished, Samson returned to visit his wife, bringing her a young goat. And he said to her father, “I am going to my wife in her room.”

(Judges 15:2) 
Her father answered him, “I truly believed that you hated her, and therefore I gave her to your friend. But look, she has a younger sister who is more beautiful than her; take her instead of your wife.”

(Judges 15:3) 
Samson then said to him, “I am innocent concerning the Philistines at this time, for I will surely bring them trouble anyway.”

(Judges 15:4) 
And he went and began to catch three hundred foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs and placed a torch between each pair of tails.

(Judges 15:5) 
He lit the torches on fire, then released the foxes into the Philistines’ grain fields. The flames immediately burned up the standing grain, both in the fields and in the vineyards and olive groves, causing widespread destruction.

(Judges 15:6) 
Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” And they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the man from Timnah, because he took his wife and gave her to another man.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.

(Judges 15:7) 
Samson said to them, “Since you have done this, I will surely take revenge on you for this injustice, and then I will be satisfied.”

(Judges 15:8) 
And he struck them down with a mighty blow, crushing them from thigh to shin. Then he went down and stayed in the cave in the rock of Etam.

(Judges 15:9) 
Then the Philistines went up into the land of Judah and camped in a place that was later called Lehi, which means 'Jawbone,' where their army had gathered.

(Judges 15:10) 
The tribe of Judah asked them, “Why have you come up against us?” They answered, “We have come to tie up Samson and hand him over to the Philistines, for he has done evil things to us.”

(Judges 15:11) 
So three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam, where they tied Samson up and delivered him to the Philistines.

(Judges 15:12) 
When they reached the place of Lehi, the Philistines rushed to meet him, shouting. But the Spirit of the Lord powerfully came upon Samson, and the ropes that bound him became like flax threads consumed by fire, and his loosened restraints fell from his hands.

(Judges 15:13) 
He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, which was lying there at that time, and he took it up and killed a thousand men with it.

(Judges 15:14) 
And Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, with the jawbone of a young donkey, I have completely defeated them and struck down a thousand men.”

(Judges 15:15) 
When he had finished speaking these words, he threw the jawbone from his hand and called the name of that place Ramath Lehi, which means 'Jawbone Heights' —a memorial to his victory.

(Judges 15:16) 
Then, being intensely thirsty, he cried out to the Lord and said, “You have granted this great deliverance into the hand of your servant. And now, behold, I am dying of thirst and will fall into the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines.”

(Judges 15:17) 
So God opened a hollow place in the jawbone at Lehi, and water came out from it. Samson drank, and his spirit was revived, and he regained his strength. Because of this, the name of that spring was called En Hakkore, meaning 'Spring of Him Who Called,' and it is known by that name to this very day.

(Judges 15:18) 
And Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines’ rule.

(Judges 15:19) 
Samson then went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her.

(Judges 15:20) 
And when they had laid down, he drew his sword and killed them. And when he drew swords to enter—this phrasing is notably ambiguous in the Clementine Vulgate—they knew.

(Judges 16:1) 
Samson traveled to Gaza. While there, he saw a harlot, and he went in to be with her.

(Judges 16:2) 
When the Philistines heard about this, they immediately shut the city gates. They posted guards there all night, waiting silently, planning to kill Samson when he tried to escape in the morning. However, Samson slept only until the middle of the night. Rising at midnight, he seized the city gates along with both doorposts and the heavy crossbar. He hoisted the entire assembly onto his shoulders, carrying it all the way to the top of the mountain that overlooks Hebron.

(Judges 16:3) 
After these events, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek valley.

(Judges 16:4) 
The Philistine lords came to Delilah and said to her, “Deceive Samson. Find out from him what makes him so incredibly strong, and how we might overcome him, so we can bind and subdue him. Each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver if you succeed.”

(Judges 16:5) 
So Delilah spoke to Samson, “Please tell me, what is the secret of your exceptional strength, and what could bind you to hold you captive?”

(Judges 16:6) 
Samson answered her, “If I am bound with seven fresh, undried bowstrings that have been twisted together, I will become weak, just like any other man.”

(Judges 16:7) 
Then the Philistine lords brought her seven such bowstrings, still fresh as he had described, and she used them to bind him.

(Judges 16:8) 
Some Philistine men were lying in ambush in her bedroom. Delilah cried out to Samson, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bonds as easily as a thread of tow breaks when it touches fire. The secret of his strength remained unknown.

(Judges 16:9) 
Delilah said to him, “See? You have mocked me and told me lies! Now, please tell me truly how you can be bound.”

(Judges 16:10) 
Samson answered her, “If I am bound with new ropes that have never been used for any work, I will become weak, just like any other man.”

(Judges 16:11) 
So Delilah bound him with new ropes and again cried out, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” while the men lay hidden in the bedroom. But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were mere threads.

(Judges 16:12) 
Delilah then said to Samson, “How long will you keep deceiving me and telling me lies? Tell me how you can be overcome!” He replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom, and then fasten it down with a peg into the ground, I will become weak and just like any other man.”

(Judges 16:13) 
So Delilah did this; she wove his seven braids into the fabric and fastened it with a peg to the ground. Then she cried out to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled out the peg, along with the loom and the fabric.

(Judges 16:14) 
Then Delilah said to him, “How can you claim to love me when your heart isn't truly with me? You have lied to me three times, and you still refuse to tell me the secret of your extraordinary strength.”

(Judges 16:15) 
Because she was so bothersome to him, constantly pressing him with her pleas and questions day after day, his soul became distressed to the point of death.

(Judges 16:16) 
He finally revealed his whole heart to her and said, “No razor has ever touched my head, because I have been a Nazirite, consecrated to God, from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would depart from me, I would become weak, all my power would leave me, and I would be just like any other man.”

(Judges 16:17) 
When Delilah saw that he had fully revealed his heart to her, she sent a message to the Philistine lords, saying, “Come up once more, for he has now opened his whole heart to me.” So they came up, bringing the money they had promised.

(Judges 16:18) 
Delilah made Samson sleep with his head resting on her lap. Then she called for a barber and had him shave off the seven braids of Samson’s head. Delilah then began to torment him, and his strength immediately departed from him.

(Judges 16:19) 
She cried out to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He woke from his sleep, thinking to himself, “I will go out as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.

(Judges 16:20) 
So the Philistines seized him. They immediately gouged out his eyes and led him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze chains and put him in prison, making him grind grain.

(Judges 16:21) 
However, his hair had already begun to grow back.

(Judges 16:22) 
The Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.”

(Judges 16:23) 
And when the people saw him, they also praised their god, saying the same thing: “Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, who devastated our land and killed so many of us.”

(Judges 16:24) 
Overflowing with joy and feasting with great enthusiasm, they commanded that Samson be called to entertain them. When he was brought from the prison, he performed for them, and they made him stand between two pillars.

(Judges 16:25) 
Then Samson said to the boy who was guiding him, “Let me feel the pillars that support this entire house, so I can lean against them and rest for a moment.”

(Judges 16:26) 
The house was full of men and women; all the Philistine lords were present, and on the roof, about three thousand men and women were watching Samson entertain them.

(Judges 16:27) 
Samson then called out to the Lord, saying, “Lord God, remember me, I beg you. Strengthen me just this once more, my God, so that I may take revenge on my enemies for my two eyes.”

(Judges 16:28) 
Then, gripping the two central pillars that supported the house, one with his right hand and the other with his left, he declared, “Let my soul die with the Philistines!”

(Judges 16:29) 
With all his might, he pushed the pillars, and immediately the house collapsed, bringing down all the lords and everyone else who was in it. So Samson killed many more people at his death than he had killed during his entire life.

(Judges 16:30) 
Then his brothers and all his family came down, took his body, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the tomb of Manoah, his father. Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.

(Judges 16:1) 
Samson also traveled to the city of Gaza, and there he saw a harlot woman, and he went in to her.

(Judges 16:2) 
When the Philistines heard, and knew that Samson had come to Gaza, they surrounded him, and laid in wait by the city gates all night. They were silent, saying to themselves: "We will ambush him until morning, and then we will kill him."

(Judges 16:3) 
But Samson remained there until midnight. Then he arose, and took hold of both doors of the city gate, along with their posts and the bar, and he placed them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the mountain that faces Hebron.

(Judges 16:4) 
After this, Samson fell in love with a woman who lived in the Valley of Sorek, and her name was Delilah.

(Judges 16:5) 
The lords of the Philistines came to her and said: "Deceive him, and learn from him where his great strength lies, and how we might overcome him and bind him to afflict him. We, for our part, will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."

(Judges 16:6) 
So Delilah said to Samson: "Tell me, I beg you, where your greatest strength lies, and what could bind you so that you could not escape."

(Judges 16:7) 
And Samson said to her: "If I am bound with seven fresh cords, not yet dried, such as new bowstrings are usually made, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."

(Judges 16:8) 
So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven ropes, like cords, not yet dry, with which she bound him.

(Judges 16:9) 
While men lay hidden with her in the bedroom, she cried out: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he snapped the cords as a strand of flax is snapped if it touches fire. And his strength was still unknown.

(Judges 16:10) 
Then Delilah said to Samson: "Look, you have mocked me and spoken falsely! At least now tell me how you ought to be bound."

(Judges 16:11) 
Samson answered her: "If I am bound with new ropes that have never been used for work, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."

(Judges 16:12) 
So Delilah bound him with new ropes and cried out: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" (The men were hidden with her in the bedroom.) And he snapped them like thread in his hands.

(Judges 16:13) 
And Delilah said to Samson: "How long will you mock me and speak falsely? Show me how you can be bound!" Samson answered her: "If I weave the seven locks of my head with the warp, and fasten them with a peg into the ground, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."

(Judges 16:14) 
So Delilah fastened them with a peg and a nail into the ground. And she said to him: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he rose from sleep, and pulled out the peg and the warp threads.

(Judges 16:15) 
And Delilah said to him: "How can you say that you love me, when your heart is not with me? Three times you have lied to me, and you refused to tell me where your greatest strength lies."

(Judges 16:16) 
And when she became troublesome, and tormented him with her words day after day, and wore down his spirit to the point of death,

(Judges 16:17) 
he opened his whole heart to her and said: "A razor has never touched my head, for I am a Nazirite, that is, consecrated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaven, my strength would depart from me, and I would become weak and be like any other man."

(Judges 16:18) 
And when Delilah saw that he had opened his whole heart to her, she sent word to the lords of the Philistines and commanded them, saying: "Come up just once more, because now he has revealed his whole heart to me." So they came up, bringing the money with them.

(Judges 16:19) 
And she made him sleep on her lap. While he was in a deep sleep, she had his head shaven of its seven locks. And she began to afflict him and push him away, for his strength had departed from him.

(Judges 16:20) 
And she said: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" He, roused from sleep, said: "I will go out and shake myself free, just as I have done before." But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.

(Judges 16:21) 
So the Philistines seized him, and immediately gouged out his eyes, and led him down to Gaza, bound with chains. They put him in prison and made him grind grain.

(Judges 16:22) 
Now his shaven hair had begun to grow back again.

(Judges 16:23) 
Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer magnificent sacrifices to their god Dagon, and to feast, saying: "Our god has delivered our enemy Samson into our hands!"

(Judges 16:24) 
When the citizens saw this, they praised their god, saying the same things: "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, who devastated our land and killed many of us!"

(Judges 16:25) 
And as they were rejoicing and became even more joyful after the meal, they commanded that Samson be called to entertain them. So they brought him from prison, and he entertained them. Then they made him stand between two pillars.

(Judges 16:26) 
And he said to the boy who was leading him by the hand: "Let me go, so that I may touch the pillars on which the whole house rests, and rest a little while."

(Judges 16:27) 
Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were in that place. There were also about three thousand men and women on the roof, watching Samson entertain.

(Judges 16:28) 
Then, calling upon the Lord, he said: "Lord God, remember me, and restore my former strength to me now, my God, so that I may avenge myself on my enemies, and take one vengeance for the loss of my eyes."

(Judges 16:29) 
And Samson took hold of both pillars on which the whole house rested. He grasped one with his right hand and the other with his left, and he leaned with all his might.

(Judges 16:30) 
And he said: "Let my soul die with the Philistines!" Then, pushing the pillars with great force, the house collapsed upon the lords and upon all the multitude who were there. And he killed many more in his death than he had killed in his life.

(Judges 16:31) 
Then his brothers and all his relatives went down and took his body. They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the tomb of Manoah his father. And Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.

(Judges 17:1) 
There was a man from the mountains of Ephraim whose name was Micah.

(Judges 17:2) 
He said to his mother: 'The eleven hundred pieces of silver that you stole, and about which you cursed a thief while I heard you—look, I have them. They are with me. I've given them back to you.' To which his mother replied: 'May the Lord bless you, my son.'

(Judges 17:3) 
So he gave back the eleven hundred pieces of silver to her. But his mother said to him: 'I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord with my own hand, so that you may make an idol—both carved and cast—out of it. Now I entrust it to you.'

(Judges 17:4) 
So the mother gave the money back to her son, who then gave it to a craftsman—both a carver and a metalworker—who made from it an idol, both carved and cast. And it was placed in Micah's house.

(Judges 17:5) 
Micah then set up a shrine in his house, which was like a small temple. He also made an ephod and household idols (teraphim). He consecrated one of his sons, and that son became his priest.

(Judges 17:6) 
In those days, there was no king ruling over Israel. Instead, everyone did whatever they thought was right in their own eyes.

(Judges 17:7) 
There was also a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from that tribe's family line. He was a Levite, but was living there as a temporary resident.

(Judges 17:8) 
He traveled away from his city of Bethlehem, and set out to live wherever he could find a place. As he was traveling through the mountains of Ephraim, he came to Micah's house.

(Judges 17:9) 
Micah asked him: 'Where do you come from?' He answered him: 'I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to live wherever I can, and wherever seems suitable to me.'

(Judges 17:10) 
Micah then said: 'Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me. And I will give you ten pieces of silver each year, two sets of garments, and your food.' So he stayed with him.

(Judges 17:11) 
And the Levite accepted his offer as if he were a son, and held him in high regard.

(Judges 17:12) 
Micah formally consecrated the young man (as a priest), and the young man then served Micah as his priest, living in his house.

(Judges 17:13) 
And Micah said: 'Now I know that the Lord will bless me, because I have a Levite serving as priest.'

(Judges 18:1) 
In those days, no king ruled over the nation of Israel. The tribe of Dan was still looking for a territory to settle in and make their home, because up to that time, they had not yet received their own land among the other tribes as an inheritance.

(Judges 18:2) 
So the descendants of Dan sent five of their bravest men from their kinsmen in Zorah and Eshtaol, so these men could spy out the land and investigate it thoroughly. The leaders of Dan told them, “Go and examine the land.” When these men reached the hill country of Ephraim, and entered the house of a man named Micah, they rested there for a time.

(Judges 18:3) 
While they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. So, they turned aside a bit from their path and asked him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am from Bethlehem of Judah, and I am a Levite.”

(Judges 18:4) 
Then they asked him, saying, “Please, consult the Lord for us, so we may know if the mission we are on will be successful, and if our plans will turn out as we desire.”

(Judges 18:5) 
The Levite replied to them, “Go in peace. The Lord will make your journey prosperous, and your way will be under His protection.”

(Judges 18:6) 
So the five men continued their journey and arrived at Laish. They saw the people living there securely, following the custom of the Sidonians, carefree and lacking nothing. There was no one to trouble them with any demands, and they were far from Sidon, not intermingling with any other people.

(Judges 18:7) 
When the men returned to their kinsmen in Zorah and Eshtaol, they were asked what they had done. They answered,

(Judges 18:8) 
“Rise up, and let us go up against them. For we have seen a land that is very fertile and spacious beyond measure. Come, let there be no delay! Let us go up and take possession of it, for it will require no difficult work.”

(Judges 18:9) 
God has given us a very fertile land, with very wide territories for our inheritance.”

(Judges 18:10) 
Then the five spies said, “When you go, you will come to a secure people, living in a spacious land. God has given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”

(Judges 18:11) 
So, from the tribe of Dan, that is, from Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred men set out, armed with weapons for war.

(Judges 18:12) 
They went up and encamped in Kiriath-jearim of Judah. Because of this, that place was called Mahaneh-dan, meaning 'Camp of Dan,' until the present day. It is located behind Kiriath-jearim.

(Judges 18:13) 
From there, they passed on into the hill country of Ephraim. When they reached Micah’s house,

(Judges 18:14) 
the five men who had previously been sent to spy out the land of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there is an ephod, and household idols, and a carved image, and a molten image? Consider what you should do.”

(Judges 18:15) 
And when they had turned aside a little, they came to the house of the young Levite, who was in Micah’s house. And they greeted him.

(Judges 18:16) 
Then the six hundred men, as they were armed, stood before the entrance.

(Judges 18:17) 
But the five men who had been the first spies went up, entered Micah’s house, and took the ephod, the household idols, the carved image, and the molten image. Meanwhile, the priest stood by the entrance, along with the six hundred armed men who were prepared for battle.

(Judges 18:18) 
So, they went in and took the ephod, the household idols, the carved image, and the molten image. Then the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”

(Judges 18:19) 
They replied to him, “Be silent, and put your hand over your mouth. Come with us and be a father and a priest for us. Which is better for you: to be a priest for the house of just one man, or to be a priest for a whole tribe and a family group in Israel?”

(Judges 18:20) 
And the priest was pleased, so he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and went with the Danites, in the middle of the armed crowd.

(Judges 18:21) 
As they proceeded on their way, they made sure their little children, their livestock, and all their valuable possessions went ahead of them for safety.

(Judges 18:22) 
By the time they had moved a little distance from Micah’s house, those who lived in Micah’s house heard that their brothers, the Danites, were carrying off everything they had, along with their priest.

(Judges 18:23) 
So they cried out and pursued the Danites, and when they overtook Micah, they severely rebuked him for what had happened.

(Judges 18:24) 
Micah, responding with a tearful voice, said, “You have taken away my gods, which I made for myself, and you have taken my priest, and all that I have. And yet you ask, ‘What is wrong?’”

(Judges 18:25) 
The men of Dan said to him, “Do not argue with us, and let no one hear you crying out, lest fierce men attack you and you lose your life, and the lives of all your household.”

(Judges 18:26) 
And so, the Danites continued on their journey. When Micah saw that they were stronger than he and his men, he turned back and returned to his house.

(Judges 18:27) 
Meanwhile, the Danites took what Micah had made, and they kept his priest. They then went to Laish, to a people who were at peace and secure. The Danites struck them down with the edge of the sword and burned the entire city with fire.

(Judges 18:28) 
There was no one to help them, because they lived far from Sidon and had no alliance with any other people, either of a city or of the countryside. The place was in a valley that belonged to Beth-rehob. So the Danites built a new city and lived in it.

(Judges 18:29) 
And the city was named Dan, after the name of their ancestor, who was a son of Israel. Previously, the city had been called Laish.

(Judges 18:30) 
And the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his descendants became priests for the tribe of Dan, serving there until the day of the captivity of the land.

(Judges 18:31) 
So Micah’s idol remained with them for all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh.

(Judges 19:1) 
It happened then in those days, when there was no king in Israel (which signified a time of great moral and social disorder), that a certain Levite man, a sojourner, was living on the side of Mount Ephraim. This Levite took for himself a concubine as a wife from Bethlehem of Judah.

(Judges 19:2) 
She left him, and returned to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, and remained with him for four months.

(Judges 19:3) 
So her husband went to her, intending to bring her back by speaking kindly to her, taking with him a servant and two donkeys. She received him and brought him into her father's house. When her father-in-law saw him, he rejoiced at his arrival.

(Judges 19:4) 
And his father-in-law urged him to stay, and he remained with him for three days, eating and drinking and sleeping there together.

(Judges 19:5) 
On the fourth day, as he rose early in the morning, he intended to depart. But his father-in-law said to him: "Refresh your spirits a little with food, and then you may leave."

(Judges 19:6) 
So they sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to her husband: "Please, stay here today and enjoy yourself."

(Judges 19:7) 
But he rose, preparing to leave. And his father-in-law began to restrain him again, so he stayed there overnight once more.

(Judges 19:8) 
Rising early on the fifth day to depart, his father-in-law said to him: "Please, refresh your spirits, and wait a little while until the day passes and it declines towards evening." And they both ate together.

(Judges 19:9) 
When the Levite rose to leave with his concubine-wife and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him: "Look, the day is already drawing towards its end, and night is approaching. Stay with me today and overnight. Behold, the sun is already setting; spend the night here and enjoy yourself. And tomorrow morning you may depart and go to your own house."

(Judges 19:10) 
He refused. Instead, he immediately set out and came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem, having with him two loaded donkeys, and his concubine-wife and his servant.

(Judges 19:11) 
As they were now near Jebus, a great part of the day had passed, and the twilight (the time of gathering darkness) had fallen. And the servant boy said to his master: "Please come, let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and stay in it."

(Judges 19:12) 
His master answered him: "We will not enter the town of this foreign people, who are not from Israel, but we will pass on as far as Gibeah."

(Judges 19:13) 
And he added: "Come, let us pass through to one of the other places, and stay in Gibeah, or in Ramah."

(Judges 19:14) 
So they passed on, and when the sun was already setting, they entered Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin.

(Judges 19:15) 
When they had entered there, they sat in the city square, and no one was willing to receive them into their house for lodging, so that they might spend the night.

(Judges 19:16) 
And behold, an old man appeared, returning from his work in the fields in the evening. He himself was also from Mount Ephraim and was living as a sojourner in Gibeah. The men of that city, however, were sons of Belial (meaning, utterly wicked and lawless men).

(Judges 19:17) 
And lifting his eyes, he saw the sojourning traveler sitting in the city square, and he said to him: "Where do you come from? And where are you going?"

(Judges 19:18) 
He replied: "We are traveling from Bethlehem of Judah as far as the side of Mount Ephraim, from which place I also come. We went to Bethlehem of Judah, and now we are returning from there, going to my own house. And there is no one who will receive us into his house."

(Judges 19:19) 
"We have hay and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for my use and for your female servant (my concubine-wife), and for the boy who is with you. We lack nothing except hospitality."

(Judges 19:20) 
To him the old man said: "Peace be with you. Whatever you need shall be provided by my care. Only, please, do not remain in the square."

(Judges 19:21) 
And he brought him into his house and provided fodder for the donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they received food.

(Judges 19:22) 
After they were refreshed and cheerful, behold, the men of that city, sons of Belial (wicked men), surrounded the house and began to pound on the doors, shouting to the old master of the house, saying: "Bring out the man who has come into your house, so that we may sexually abuse him."

(Judges 19:23) 
And the old man went out to them and said: "No, my brothers, do not do this evil, for this man has come into my house as my guest. And cease from this depravity."

(Judges 19:24) 
"I have a virgin daughter, and this man has his concubine-wife. I will bring them out, and you may shame them and do to them whatever pleases you. Only, I beg of you, do not commit this wicked act against this man."

(Judges 19:25) 
But they refused to listen and tried to force their way to the man. Seeing this, the man seized his concubine-wife and brought her out to them. They abused her sexually, and throughout the entire night, they violently raped her in turn. And when it was already dawning, they released her.

(Judges 19:26) 
The woman came in the morning and collapsed at the door of the house where her husband was staying, and there she died.

(Judges 19:27) 
And her husband opened the door in the morning, and went out to set out on his journey, and found his concubine-wife lying at the door, with her hands on the threshold.

(Judges 19:28) 
And he said to her: "Get up, and let's go." But she did not answer, for she lay there dead. The man, realizing it was a corpse, took her up and placed her on the donkey, and returned to his house.

(Judges 19:29) 
When he had returned there, he took a knife, and with her bones, he divided his concubine-wife into twelve parts. And he sent these parts into all the territories of Israel.

(Judges 19:30) 
When all who saw this saw it, they said: "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel since the day our fathers came up out of the land of Egypt, even until the present day. Consider this, men, take counsel, and speak your minds."

(Judges 19:1) 
It happened in those days, when Israel had no king and was ruled by judges, that there was a Levite man, living in the mountainous region of Ephraim. He took a concubine wife from Bethlehem in Judah.

(Judges 19:2) 
His concubine became angry with him and left him, returning to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. She remained there with him for four months, or even longer.

(Judges 19:3) 
Her husband then rose up and went to her, intending to bring her back by speaking kindly to her, and to take her with him. He had with him a servant and two donkeys. When the woman received him, she led him into her father’s house. When her father saw him, they rejoiced and celebrated his arrival.

(Judges 19:4) 
The father-in-law, the woman's father, kept him for three days. During this time, the Levite ate and drank with him, and stayed at his house. On the fourth day, he rose up in the night, intending to leave.

(Judges 19:5) 
But his father-in-law said to him, "Please, refresh your spirit a little, and taste some bread, and then you may leave."

(Judges 19:6) 
So the Levite sat down, and both he and his father-in-law ate and drank together. Then the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "I beg you, stay here today, and let us enjoy ourselves together."

(Judges 19:7) 
But when the Levite prepared to leave in the morning, his father-in-law urged him, saying, "Refresh your spirit, and stay here until evening." So both of them ate and drank again.

(Judges 19:8) 
The man rose up to leave with his wife and servant. But his father-in-law again said to him, "Please, strengthen yourself, I beg you, and stay here today also. See, the sun is setting, and the day is now turning into darkness. Stay with me, eat and drink, and tomorrow morning when it becomes light, you may leave and go to your home."

(Judges 19:9) 
But he refused. Instead, he immediately continued on his way and departed. He came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem, having with him his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.

(Judges 19:10) 
Now they had approached Jebus, and night was upon them. The servant said to his master, "Please come, let us turn aside into the city of the Jebusites and stay there overnight."

(Judges 19:11) 
But his master answered him, "We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeon."

(Judges 19:12) 
And he added, "Come, let us hurry to one of these cities, and we will stay there, either in Gibeah or in Ramah."

(Judges 19:13) 
So they passed by Jebus and continued on their way. The sun set for them near Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin.

(Judges 19:14) 
They turned aside to Gibeah to stay there. When they had entered, they sat down in the city square, but no one offered them hospitality.

(Judges 19:15) 
And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the fields in the evening. He, too, was from the mountainous region of Ephraim and was living as a sojourner in Gibeah. But the men of that region were sons of Belial—meaning wicked men—and they were unwilling to receive any guest.

(Judges 19:16) 
Lifting his eyes, the old man saw the traveling man in the city square. He said to him, "Where are you coming from? And where are you going?"

(Judges 19:17) 
The man answered, "I am traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the innermost parts of the mountainous region of Ephraim, which is where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am returning from there, striving to reach my home. Yet, no one receives me into his house."

(Judges 19:18) 
"We have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for our own use, and for your female servant and your male servant. We lack nothing, except this one thing: that you take us in as guests."

(Judges 19:19) 
The old man said to him, "Peace be with you. All that you desire, I have at hand. Only, I beg you, do not stay in the city square."

(Judges 19:20) 
So he brought him into his house and gave fodder to his donkeys. The travelers then washed their feet, and they ate and drank.

(Judges 19:21) 
While they were refreshing themselves and feasting, suddenly the men of the city, sons of Belial—meaning lawless men—surrounded the house. They struck the door, crying out to the old master of the house, saying, "Bring out the man who has entered your house, so that we may abuse him."

(Judges 19:22) 
The old man went out to them and said, "No, my brothers, no, I beg you, do not commit this wickedness, because this man has entered my house. Cease from this shameful act."

(Judges 19:23) 
"Here is my virgin daughter, and here is his concubine. I will bring them out to you, so you may humble them and do to them whatever pleases you. Only, I beg you, do not commit this wicked act against the man."

(Judges 19:24) 
But the men would not listen. They continued with their incitement and wanted to humiliate the man by force, having seized his concubine. Seeing this, the man took hold of his concubine and threw her out the door. They took her, abused her all night, and treated her with indignities until morning.

(Judges 19:25) 
And they let her go as the day departed. But the woman, in the morning when it was already growing light, came to the door of the house where her husband was staying, and there she collapsed.

(Judges 19:26) 
And she lay dead before the feet of her husband. He opened the door and went out, intending to prepare for his journey. He found the corpse of his wife lying on the threshold before the house, with her hands spread out over the threshold.

(Judges 19:27) 
Thinking she was resting, he said to her, "Get up and walk." When no one responded, and realizing that she was dead, he lifted her up and placed her on the donkey. Then he returned to his home.

(Judges 19:28) 
When he had entered his house, he seized a knife and cut the corpse of his wife, along with her bones, into twelve pieces. He then sent these pieces into all the borders of Israel.

(Judges 19:29) 
And as such things were carried through each and every region, everyone who saw it cried out, "Nothing like this has ever happened, nor has anything like it been seen, from the day the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt until this present day. Men, consider this matter, consult together, and speak what seems right to you."

(Judges 19:30) 
And it was as if all of them had said with one voice, "Such a terrible and horrifying thing has never happened in Israel!"

(Judges 19:31)

(Judges 20:1) 
Then all the sons of Israel went out, from Dan all the way to Beersheba in the south, and from the land of Gilead in the east.
They gathered as one man before the Lord in Mizpah, in a solemn assembly.

(Judges 20:2) 
All the leading men of the people came, and all the tribes of Israel formed an assembly of God's people.
There were four hundred thousand foot soldiers, all experienced men of war.

(Judges 20:3) 
Without delay, even the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.

(Judges 20:4) 
Then the sons of Israel said: "Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?"

(Judges 20:5) 
The Levite, the husband of the dishonored concubine, responded: "I came to Gibeah of the Benjaminites with my concubine so we could stay there for the night.

(Judges 20:6) 
But behold, the men of that city rose up against me.
They intended to burn down my house, to violate my concubine, and to brutally kill her.

(Judges 20:7) 
When I saw that she had been horribly abused throughout the entire night, I finally let her go, dead, at the doorstep of my house.

(Judges 20:8) 
So I took her, and cut her into pieces, and sent her to all the borders of your inheritance throughout Israelite territory.
I did this because no one had even considered what a wicked deed was committed, and no such thing has ever happened in Israel before.

(Judges 20:9) 
Behold, you are all here, sons of Israel.
Decide what you ought to do.

(Judges 20:10) 
Let us take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand.
These men will prepare provisions for the army.
Then the rest of the army will go and strike the city of Gibeah of Benjamin, because they have committed such a disgraceful thing in Israel.

(Judges 20:11) 
So all Israel assembled against the city as one man, with the same mind and purpose.

(Judges 20:12) 
And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin, saying: "Why has such wickedness been found among you?"

(Judges 20:13) 
Hand over the men of Gibeah, those sons of Belial (a term for worthless and wicked men), who committed this atrocity, so they may die and evil may be removed from Israel."
But the Benjaminites were unwilling to listen to the commands and words of their brothers, the sons of Israel.
Instead, they gathered together from their cities to help the inhabitants of Gibeah.

(Judges 20:14) 
And those counted from the cities of Benjamin who had come armed for battle were twenty-six thousand men.
This number did not include the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were seven hundred very strong men.

(Judges 20:15) 
From all these people, there were six hundred chosen men who used both hands as if they were their right hand (meaning they were ambidextrous or extremely skilled).
They hurled stones with slings so precisely that not a single one would miss its target.

(Judges 20:16) 
Apart from these, there were also found among the men of Israel four hundred thousand fighting men, that is, warriors, who were all ready for battle.

(Judges 20:17) 
These were the ones who had gathered in one place.

(Judges 20:18) 
Then the sons of Israel came and consulted the Lord, saying: "Who among us shall go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin?"
To them the Lord responded: "Judah will go up first."

(Judges 20:19) 
Immediately the sons of Israel rose early in the morning and encamped near Gibeah.

(Judges 20:20) 
And going out from there to battle against Benjamin, they arrayed themselves for battle against them near Gibeah.

(Judges 20:21) 
And the sons of Benjamin came out from Gibeah and on that day killed twenty-two thousand men of the sons of Israel.

(Judges 20:22) 
Again, the sons of Israel, trusting in the Lord their God and in their own might and courage, arrayed their battle line in the same place where they had fought before.

(Judges 20:23) 
And they went up and wept before the Lord until evening.
They consulted Him, saying: "Should I go up again to battle against the sons of Benjamin, my brothers, or not?"
To them He responded: "Go up against them."

(Judges 20:24) 
And when the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the next day, they fought.

(Judges 20:25) 
And Benjamin came out from the gates of Gibeah, and again offered them battle.
They killed eighteen thousand men of Israel, all of them fighting men.

(Judges 20:26) 
Therefore all the sons of Israel went up to the city of Bethel.
They wept before the Lord, sitting there until evening, and they afflicted themselves with fasting on that day.
They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Him.

(Judges 20:27) 
And they inquired of Him concerning their deliverance and welfare.
In those days, the Ark of the Covenant of God was in Bethel,

(Judges 20:28) 
and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was in charge of the house of God (the sanctuary).
And they consulted the Lord and said: "Should we go out again to battle against Benjamin our brothers, or should we stop?"
The Lord said to them: "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands."

(Judges 20:29) 
So the sons of Israel rose up on the next day and went against Gibeah, and surrounded it.

(Judges 20:30) 
And for a third time, they arrayed their battle lines against Benjamin, in their divisions, just as before.

(Judges 20:31) 
But the sons of Benjamin boldly came out of the city and arrayed themselves to meet them.
They began to wound and kill some of the people, just as on the first and second days.
These were those who were fleeing from all the cities, and going along the highway and through various places, so that they killed about thirty men.

(Judges 20:32) 
The Benjaminites hoped that they would rout them as before.
But while the Israelites pretended to flee, the Benjaminites, pursuing them, were drawing some away from the highway towards the city, and others into the fields.

(Judges 20:33) 
But the sons of Israel gathered all their forces together at the place called Baal-tamar.
And their ambush was gradually revealing itself from its hiding places, that is, from the hidden area of Gibeah.

(Judges 20:34) 
So ten thousand chosen warriors from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle began to rage fiercely.
But Benjamin did not understand that destruction was imminent for them.

(Judges 20:35) 
And the Lord struck Benjamin down before the sons of Israel.
On that day, they killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them fighting men.

(Judges 20:36) 
For the sons of Benjamin realized that the sons of Israel, by turning in flight from them, were making way for the ambush which Israel had set.

(Judges 20:37) 
Then those who were in ambush suddenly rushed upon Gibeah, and spread out as they passed through.
They killed everyone in the city with swords.

(Judges 20:38) 
Now the signal given by the army of Israel was that after they had captured the city, they would set it on fire, so that it would burn high up into the sky and indicate their impending victory.

(Judges 20:39) 
And when the sons of Israel were already engaged in battle, Benjamin also began to see that smoke was rising from the city.
They now clearly knew the disaster that had previously been hidden from them.

(Judges 20:40) 
And indeed, those who had feigned flight, seeing this, resisted Benjamin more strongly.
The Benjaminites, terrified, began to flee towards the city, but this did not help them.
Nor could they escape from being killed by those who had already captured the city.

(Judges 20:1) 
Therefore, all the children of Israel came out from Baala, and they gathered as one unified man, from Dan to Beersheba, and even from the land of Gilead, before the Lord in Mizpah.

(Judges 20:2) 
And all the chiefs of the Israelite tribes, and the tribes themselves, stood in the assembly of God's people. There were four hundred thousand armed foot soldiers, ready for battle.

(Judges 20:3) 
Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.

(Judges 20:4) 
And immediately, the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, spoke: 'This is an abominable thing,' he said, 'and an execrable crime that has been perpetrated in Israel. My concubine and I were in Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin, to spend the night. And behold, the men of that city surrounded us, intending to kill me, and they violently killed my concubine, so that she died.'

(Judges 20:5) 
They burst into my home, seized my concubine, and violently abused her until she died.

(Judges 20:6) 
Therefore, I divided her dead body into twelve parts and sent them into all the borders of Israel, so that the atrocity and the unspeakable evil committed in Israel would become known to everyone.

(Judges 20:7) 
Now, behold, all of you, children of Israel, discern what you ought to do about this.

(Judges 20:8) 
And all the people rose up as one unified man, saying: 'We will not go to our tents, nor will any of us return to his home.'

(Judges 20:9) 
'But this is the plan that we ought to take now against Gibeah:'

(Judges 20:10) 
'Let ten men be chosen out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the army. Then the fighters can inflict upon Gibeah of Benjamin what it deserves.'

(Judges 20:11) 
So, all the men of Israel assembled against the city as one unified man, and with one mind.

(Judges 20:12) 
And they sent messengers to the entire tribe of Benjamin, to say: 'Why has such a great crime been perpetrated among you?'

(Judges 20:13) 
'Hand over the men of Gibeah who committed this vile deed and crime, so that they may die, and evil may be removed from Israel.' But the sons of Benjamin were unwilling to listen to the words of their Israelite brothers.

(Judges 20:14) 
Instead, they gathered from all their cities into one place, and together they resolved to come out against those attacking them.

(Judges 20:15) 
There were twenty-five thousand armed fighters from the tribe of Benjamin, besides the seven hundred very strong men who were inhabitants of Gibeah.

(Judges 20:16) 
Among all those gathered, there were seven hundred very strong men who could fight with either hand as well as with their right, and they could accurately hurl stones with slings, able to strike a single hair without missing.

(Judges 20:17) 
From the rest of Israel also, apart from the children of Benjamin, there were four hundred thousand armed fighters, all of them men of war.

(Judges 20:18) 
They rose up and came to the house of God, that is, to Bethel, and consulted Him, saying: 'Who among our army should go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin?' The Lord answered: 'Judah will go up first.'

(Judges 20:19) 
And immediately they rose up in the night and encamped near Gibeah.

(Judges 20:20) 
And when the army of Israel had arrayed itself against Benjamin, they began the battle against them.

(Judges 20:21) 
And the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and killed eighteen thousand very strong men from the children of Israel.

(Judges 20:22) 
From this, the children of Israel gathered courage again, resolving to fight in the same place where they had first engaged in battle.

(Judges 20:23) 
And they went up and wept before the Lord until night, and consulted Him, saying: 'Should we proceed further to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or should we stop?' To them He responded: 'Go up against them.'

(Judges 20:24) 
And when they had advanced on the second morning, to battle against the sons of Benjamin,

(Judges 20:25) 
the sons of Benjamin came out from the gates of Gibeah and killed eighteen thousand more very strong, armed men from the children of Israel who were ready for battle.

(Judges 20:26) 
Because of this, all the children of Israel came to the house of God, and sitting there, they wept before the Lord. They fasted on that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Him.

(Judges 20:27) 
And they consulted the Lord in those days, for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was there.

(Judges 20:28) 
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it. And they inquired: 'Should we proceed further to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or should we stop?' The Lord said: 'Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.'

(Judges 20:29) 
Therefore, the children of Israel set ambushes all around the city of Gibeah.

(Judges 20:30) 
And when the battle had been joined against Benjamin for the third time, just as it had been once and twice before,

(Judges 20:31) 
and the Benjaminites had come out of the city, taking their usual route, they pursued those fleeing and killed about thirty men, just as before. The Israelites thought they were defeated, and Benjamin could now escape from their hands.

(Judges 20:32) 
However, those who were hidden in ambush in the nearby places around Gibeah, when they saw the Israelites fleeing toward Gibeah, and the Benjaminites fighting in the same way they themselves were fleeing, said: 'Let us flee, and not pursue any further, lest we be wounded in the same place as them.'

(Judges 20:33) 
But those who had been in ambush, when they saw the Benjaminites were actually defeated (and retreating into the trap), rushed upon them from behind and killed twenty-five thousand of their men.

(Judges 20:34) 
And when they had come out from Gibeah for battle, they began to kill from among them up to seven hundred men.

(Judges 20:35) 
And the Lord delivered Benjamin into the hands of Israel on that day. And they killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men from them, all of whom were warriors.

(Judges 20:36) 
For the children of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, and the Benjaminites thought they had won. But those who were hidden in ambush, the messengers and warriors, had concealed themselves around Gibeah, and all were ready for the fight.

(Judges 20:37) 
And when the children of Israel went away as if defeated, and Benjamin pursued them in their flight (for all those who were fleeing had retreated to Gibeah), those who were in the hidden places near Gibeah rushed upon them and began to kill them.

(Judges 20:38) 
And it came to pass that, while they were pursuing the fleeing Israelites, those who were in ambush raised a signal from their hidden positions, so that the fleeing Israelites would know that the whole city was now in their power.

(Judges 20:39) 
And they came out and occupied the city, and they killed all who were in it with the edge of the sword.

(Judges 20:40) 
And when Benjamin saw the city occupied, and the fires from the city were now ascending into the sky, they understood that they were defeated.

(Judges 21:1) 
The sons of Israel had also sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, "None of us will give his daughter in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin."

(Judges 21:2) 
And all the people came to the House of God at Shiloh, and remained there until evening before the Lord, and they raised their voices and began to wail with great weeping, saying:

(Judges 21:3) 
Why, O Lord, God of Israel, has this evil happened to Your people, that one tribe should be cut off from Israel?

(Judges 21:4) 
The next day, rising early, they built an altar there, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings.

(Judges 21:5) 
And they said, "Who is there from all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah?" For they had bound themselves with a solemn oath to kill those who had not come up.

(Judges 21:6) 
And they grieved over their brother Benjamin, and said, "One tribe has been destroyed from Israel!"

(Judges 21:7) 
From where will they find wives? For we all swore a common oath that we would not give our daughters to them.

(Judges 21:8) 
Therefore they said, "Who is there from all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah?" And behold, it was found that the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead had not come to that place.

(Judges 21:9) 
At that time, when the Israelites were in Shiloh, none of the people from Jabesh-Gilead had been found among them.

(Judges 21:10) 
So the sons of Israel sent there ten thousand of their strongest men, and gave them this command: "Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword, both their wives and their little children."

(Judges 21:11) 
And this is what you must observe: Every male, and every woman who has known a man, you are to kill; but save the virgins alive to become wives for Benjamin.

(Judges 21:12) 
And from Jabesh-Gilead, four hundred virgins were found who had not known a man's bed, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, in the land of Canaan.

(Judges 21:13) 
And they sent messengers to the sons of Benjamin, who were in the rock of Rimmon, and promised them peace.

(Judges 21:14) 
So the sons of Benjamin came at that time, and wives were given to them from the women of Jabesh-Gilead who had been saved; but no more wives were found to be given to the remaining men, as there weren't enough.

(Judges 21:15) 
And all the sons of Israel grieved over Benjamin, because the Lord had allowed one tribe to be diminished from His people.

(Judges 21:16) 
And the elders said, "What shall we do about the rest of the men who have not received wives? For all the women of Benjamin were killed."

(Judges 21:17) 
And they held this opinion: "Let Benjamin endure, and let one tribe remain in Israel, so that it may not be utterly destroyed."

(Judges 21:18) 
But we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for we are bound by this oath: 'Cursed be he who gives a wife from his daughters to Benjamin.'

(Judges 21:19) 
And they remembered the solemn festival of the Lord, which was celebrated every year in Shiloh. This city is located north of Bethel, on the east side of the road leading from Bethel to Shechem, and south of the town of Lebonah.

(Judges 21:20) 
And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, "Go and hide yourselves in the vineyards."

(Judges 21:21) 
And when you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then suddenly come out from the vineyards, and each of you seize a wife for yourselves from the daughters of Shiloh, and then go to the land of Benjamin.

(Judges 21:22) 
And when their fathers and their brothers come and begin to complain to us, we will say to them: 'Forgive them, for these men did not take them by right of war or as spoils of victory. Rather, you implicitly gave them to them when we begged on their behalf. Therefore, you are free from the guilt of your oath of not giving your daughters.'

(Judges 21:23) 
So the sons of Benjamin did as they had been instructed: and according to their number, each man seized a wife for himself from those who were accustomed to perform the dances. Then they went into their own possession, and built up cities, and lived in them.

(Judges 21:24) 
And so, at that time, each of the sons of Israel returned to his own tribe and family, and they went out from that place, each to his own tent.

(Judges 21:25) 
In those days there was no king in Israel; but each man did what seemed right in his own eyes, leading to chaos and ungodly acts.
