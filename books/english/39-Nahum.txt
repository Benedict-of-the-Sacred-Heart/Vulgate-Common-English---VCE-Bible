(Nahum 1:1) 
A prophecy about Nineveh. The record of Nahum of Elkosh.

(Nahum 1:2) 
The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord is avenging and full of wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries and is angry with His enemies.

(Nahum 1:3) 
The Lord is slow to anger, but great in power; He will not acquit the guilty. His way is in the tempest and the storm is under His feet.

(Nahum 1:4) 
He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the bloom of Lebanon fades.

(Nahum 1:5) 
The mountains quake because of Him, and the hills melt away. The earth trembles before Him, the world and all who dwell in it.

(Nahum 1:6) 
Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the heat of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are shattered by Him.

(Nahum 1:7) 
The Lord is good, a refuge in the day of distress; He knows those who trust in Him.

(Nahum 1:8) 
But with an overflowing flood He will make an end of its place, and will pursue His enemies into darkness.

(Nahum 1:9) 
What do you plot against the Lord? He will make an end; He will not take vengeance twice.

(Nahum 1:10) 
For though they are like tangled thorns, though they are drunkards as they drink, they shall be consumed like dry stubble.

(Nahum 1:11) 
From you came one who devised evil against the Lord, a wicked counselor.

(Nahum 1:12) 
Thus says the Lord: “Though they are at full strength and many, they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.

(Nahum 1:13) 
And now I will break his yoke from your neck, and I will burst your bonds.

(Nahum 1:14) 
The Lord has given a command concerning you: Your name shall be perpetuated no longer. From the house of your gods I will cut off the carved image and the cast image. I will make your grave, for you are worthless.

(Nahum 1:15) 
Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, fulfill your vows, for never again shall the wicked pass through you; he is utterly cut off.

(Nahum 2:1) 
The army is coming! Prepare yourself. Guard your city. Strengthen your defenses.

(Nahum 2:2) 
The Lord will destroy the pride of Jacob, as He destroyed Israel. Because the destroyers will destroy them and break their branches.

(Nahum 2:3) 
The shields of their soldiers are red. Their soldiers are dressed in scarlet. The fire of destruction is ready. The chariots are like lightning!

(Nahum 2:4) 
The chariots will rush through the streets, colliding in the city squares. The appearance of the soldiers is like torches, as flashes of lightning.

(Nahum 2:5) 
The best soldiers will be called forward, but they will stumble in their haste. The city's protective wall will be prepared.

(Nahum 2:6) 
The river gates will be opened, and the palace will be captured.

(Nahum 2:7) 
The captives will be taken away, and the captive women will mourn like doves.

(Nahum 2:8) 
Nineveh is like a pool of water, but its people are fleeing. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.

(Nahum 2:9) 
Take the silver! Take the gold! There is no end to the valuable treasures.

(Nahum 2:10) 
Nineveh is now wasted, plundered, and destroyed. The heart is broken, the knees are shaking, the body trembles, and the faces are blackened.

(Nahum 2:11) 
Where is the den of the lions? Where is the feeding ground for the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked? No one will scare them now.

(Nahum 2:12) 
The lion tore apart enough for its cubs, and strangled enough for the lionesses. He filled his caves with prey and his dens with spoils.

(Nahum 2:13) 
“I am against you,” says the Lord of Hosts. “I will burn your chariots in smoke. The sword will consume your young lions. I will not let your spoils echo your boasts.”

(Nahum 2:14) 
The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard. Your city will never again be destroyed.

(Nahum 3:1) 
Woe to that bloody city! That city of constant lies and endless robbery! The pillaging will never end.

(Nahum 3:2) 
Listen to the cracking whip! Hear the noise of the wheels! See the galloping horses and the bouncing chariots,

(Nahum 3:3) 
Watch the horsemen charging, the flashing swords and the glittering spears! There are so many dead. Corpses pile up. There is no end to the dead! They stumble over the bodies.

(Nahum 3:4) 
This is because of the countless sins of the prostitute, the beautiful harlot! She seduced the nations with her prostitution and the families with her spells.

(Nahum 3:5) 
“Look,” says the Lord of Hosts, “I am against you! I will lift your skirts and expose your shame before the nations, and show the kingdoms your disgrace.

(Nahum 3:6) 
I will cast abominations upon you and disgrace you. I will make you a spectacle.

(Nahum 3:7) 
Then everyone who sees you will flee from you, saying, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will mourn for her?' Where shall I seek someone to comfort you?

(Nahum 3:8) 
Are you better than Thebes, which was situated on the Nile, surrounded by water? Her ramparts were the sea; the water was her wall.

(Nahum 3:9) 
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength. There was no limit to her power. Put and Libya were among her allies.

(Nahum 3:10) 
Yet she was captured and carried away. Her little children were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains.

(Nahum 3:11) 
So you also will become drunk and hidden. You will seek refuge from the enemy.

(Nahum 3:12) 
All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe figs; if they are shaken, they fall straight into the mouth of the eater.

(Nahum 3:13) 
Look, your people within you are like women. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed your bars.

(Nahum 3:14) 
Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the mud and trample it. Repair your brick molds.

(Nahum 3:15) 
There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; increase like the grasshopper.

(Nahum 3:16) 
You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the sky. Like the locust, they swarm and fly away.

(Nahum 3:17) 
Your princes are like grasshoppers, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle on the walls in the cold. When the sun comes up, they fly away, and no one knows where they have gone.

(Nahum 3:18) 
Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria. Your nobles lie in the dust; your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.

(Nahum 3:19) 
There is no healing for your wound. Your injury is severe. All who hear the news of you clap their hands over you, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?
