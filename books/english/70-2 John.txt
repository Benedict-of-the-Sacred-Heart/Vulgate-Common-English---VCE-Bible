(2 John 1:1) 
The Elder writes this letter to the chosen Lady and her children, whom I love in truthâ€”and not only I, but also all those who have come to know the truth of Christ.

(2 John 1:2) 
This is because the truth of Christ dwells in us, and will be with us eternally.

(2 John 1:3) 
May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.

(2 John 1:4) 
I rejoiced greatly when I found some of your children living according to the truth, just as we received a commandment to do from God the Father.

(2 John 1:5) 
And now I ask you, Lady, not as though I am writing a new commandment for you, but that which we have had from the very beginning: that we love one another.

(2 John 1:6) 
And this is true love: that we live according to His commandments. This is the commandment that you have heard from the beginning of your faith: that you should live by it.

(2 John 1:7) 
Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has truly come in human flesh. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist, denying the reality of the Incarnation.

(2 John 1:8) 
Watch yourselves carefully, so that you do not lose the spiritual fruits you have worked for. Instead, remain faithful, so that you may receive a full and complete reward.

(2 John 1:9) 
Everyone who goes astray and does not remain in the true teaching of Christ does not have God with them. But whoever remains in the true doctrine of Christ, that person has both God the Father and God the Son.

(2 John 1:10) 
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this true doctrine of Christ, do not receive him into your house, nor offer him any greeting of welcome, for that would be to share in his evil work.

(2 John 1:11) 
For anyone who offers him a greeting of welcome, thereby shares in his evil works and aids his mission.

(2 John 1:12) 
Although I have many more things to write to you, I did not wish to communicate them through paper and ink. For I hope to be with you soon, and to speak to you face to face, so that our joy may be full.

(2 John 1:13) 
The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. Amen.
