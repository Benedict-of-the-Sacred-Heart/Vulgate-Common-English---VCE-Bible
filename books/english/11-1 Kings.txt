(1 Kings 1:1) 
King David had grown old, and he was advanced in years. Even when he was covered with clothing, he could not get warm.

(1 Kings 1:2) 
So his servants said to him: "Let us seek out for our lord, the king, a young virgin maiden. She can stand before the king, keep him warm, and sleep by his side to make our lord the king feel warm."

(1 Kings 1:3) 
So they searched throughout all the borders of Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.

(1 Kings 1:4) 
The young woman was exceptionally beautiful. She cared for the king and ministered to him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.

(1 Kings 1:5) 
Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to boast, saying: "I will be king." He prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men who would run before him.

(1 Kings 1:6) 
His father had never rebuked him at any time by saying: "Why have you done this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, being the next oldest son after Absalom.

(1 Kings 1:7) 
He conspired with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both supported Adonijah and followed him.

(1 Kings 1:8) 
However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty warriors were not with Adonijah.

(1 Kings 1:9) 
Adonijah then offered sacrifices of sheep, calves, and all the fatlings by the Stone of Zoheleth, which is near the fountain of Rogel. He invited all the king's sons and all the men of Judah who were the king's servants.

(1 Kings 1:10) 
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:11) 
So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, saying: "Have you heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it?"

(1 Kings 1:12) 
"Now therefore, come, I will give you advice so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon."

(1 Kings 1:13) 
"Go, and go in to King David, and say to him: 'My lord king, did you not swear to me, your handmaid, saying: "Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?" Why then does Adonijah reign?'"

(1 Kings 1:14) 
"And while you are still speaking there with the king, I will immediately come in after you and confirm your words."

(1 Kings 1:15) 
So Bathsheba went in to the king in his private chamber. The king had grown very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to him.

(1 Kings 1:16) 
Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king. The king asked her: "What do you want?"

(1 Kings 1:17) 
She answered, saying: "My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid, that your son Solomon would reign after you, and that he himself would sit on your throne."

(1 Kings 1:18) 
"And behold, now Adonijah reigns, and you, my lord king, do not know about it."

(1 Kings 1:19) 
"He has sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep to all the king's sons, and to Zadok the priest, and to Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. But he did not invite your servant Solomon."

(1 Kings 1:20) 
"But now, my lord king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, waiting for you to declare who will sit on your throne after you."

(1 Kings 1:21) 
"Otherwise, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers (meaning, when you die), I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders and will likely be put to death."

(1 Kings 1:22) 
While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet entered.

(1 Kings 1:23) 
They announced to the king, saying: "Behold, Nathan the prophet!" When he had come in before the king and bowed down before him with his face to the ground,

(1 Kings 1:24) 
Nathan said: "My lord king, have you indeed declared: 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'?"

(1 Kings 1:25) 
"Because today he went down and sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep to all the king's sons, and to the commanders of the army, and to Abiathar the priest. And they are eating and drinking before him and shouting: 'Long live King Adonijah!'"

(1 Kings 1:26) 
"But he did not invite me, your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon."

(1 Kings 1:27) 
"If this declaration has come from my lord the king, why have you not informed me, your servant, who should sit on your throne after you?"

(1 Kings 1:28) 
Then King David answered, saying: "Call Bathsheba to me." When she had come in before the king and stood before him,

(1 Kings 1:29) 
The king swore an oath and said: "As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from every trouble and distress,"

(1 Kings 1:30) 
"Just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' so I will do this very day."

(1 Kings 1:31) 
Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, and paying homage to the king, she said: "May my lord King David live forever!"

(1 Kings 1:32) 
King David also said: "Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada to me." When they had come in before the king,

(1 Kings 1:33) 
He said to them: "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own royal mule, and bring him down to Gihon."

(1 Kings 1:34) 
"And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then sound the trumpet and declare: 'Long live King Solomon!'"

(1 Kings 1:35) 
"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place. For I have commanded that he be the leader over Israel and over Judah."

(1 Kings 1:36) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king, saying: "Amen! May the Lord God of my lord the king confirm this as true!"

(1 Kings 1:37) 
"Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and may He make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David."

(1 Kings 1:38) 
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down. They put Solomon upon King David's own royal mule and brought him to Gihon.

(1 Kings 1:39) 
Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They sounded the trumpet, and all the people shouted: "Long live King Solomon!"

(1 Kings 1:40) 
And all the multitude went up after him, with the people playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so much so that the earth echoed from the sound of their shouting.

(1 Kings 1:1) 
King David was now very old and advanced in years. Even when he was covered with blankets, he could not get warm.

(1 Kings 1:2) 
So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young, virgin girl for our lord the king. Let her serve the king and care for him, and let her sleep close to him to keep our lord the king warm."

(1 Kings 1:3) 
So they searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman, and they found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

(1 Kings 1:4) 
The girl was indeed exceedingly beautiful, and she cared for the king and attended to his needs. But the king did not have sexual relations with her.

(1 Kings 1:5) 
Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to boast, saying, "I will be king!" He prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him as his personal guard.

(1 Kings 1:6) 
His father had never corrected him at any time by asking, "Why are you doing this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, and he was the next eldest son after Absalom.

(1 Kings 1:7) 
Adonijah consulted with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both gave their support to Adonijah and followed him.

(1 Kings 1:8) 
However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mightiest warriors did not join Adonijah.

(1 Kings 1:9) 
Adonijah sacrificed sheep, calves, and all the fatlings near the stone of Zoheleth, which is close to the spring of Rogel. He then invited all the king's sons and all the men of Judah who served the king.

(1 Kings 1:10) 
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mightiest warriors, nor his brother Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:11) 
So Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, has made himself king, and our master David does not even know about it?"

(1 Kings 1:12) 
Now then, come, and I will give you advice so that you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:13) 
Go, enter King David's presence, and say to him, "Did you not, my lord the king, swear to me, your handmaid, saying, 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'? How then is Adonijah now reigning as king?"

(1 Kings 1:14) 
While you are still speaking with the king there, I will immediately come in after you and confirm everything you have said.

(1 Kings 1:15) 
So Bathsheba went into the king's chamber. The king was now very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.

(1 Kings 1:16) 
Bathsheba bowed low and paid homage to the king. The king asked her, "What do you want?"

(1 Kings 1:17) 
She replied, "My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid that your son Solomon would reign after you, and that he himself would sit upon your throne."

(1 Kings 1:18) 
And now, Adonijah is reigning as king, and you, my lord the king, do not even know about it.

(1 Kings 1:19) 
He has sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:20) 
So now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are looking to you, to declare who will sit on your throne after you.

(1 Kings 1:21) 
Otherwise, when my lord the king passes away and rests with his ancestors, my son Solomon and I will be considered criminals and treated as such.

(1 Kings 1:22) 
While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.

(1 Kings 1:23) 
They announced to the king, saying, "Nathan the prophet is here!" When he entered the king's presence, he bowed down with his face to the ground and paid homage.

(1 Kings 1:24) 
Nathan said, "My lord the king, did you say that Adonijah is to reign after you, and that he is to sit upon my throne?"

(1 Kings 1:25) 
For today he went down and sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And they ate and drank before him, and shouted, 'Long live King Adonijah!'

(1 Kings 1:26) 
But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he did not invite.

(1 Kings 1:27) 
Has this decree truly come from my lord the king? And have you not informed your servant who is to sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?

(1 Kings 1:28) 
King David answered, "Call Bathsheba to me." When she came into the king's presence and stood before him,

(1 Kings 1:29) 
The king took an oath and said, "As the Lord lives, who has delivered my soul from every distress—"

(1 Kings 1:30) 
—just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place,' this very day I will carry it out!"

(1 Kings 1:31) 
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, paid homage to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"

(1 Kings 1:32) 
King David then gave an order: "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." When they had come into the king's presence,

(1 Kings 1:33) 
The king said to them, "Take with you my royal servants. Set my son Solomon upon my own mule and bring him down to Gihon."

(1 Kings 1:34) 
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'

(1 Kings 1:35) 
Then return up here, following him. He is to sit upon my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place, for I have appointed him to be ruler over both Israel and Judah.

(1 Kings 1:36) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king, saying, "So be it! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, confirm it."

(1 Kings 1:37) 
Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and may He make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David.

(1 Kings 1:38) 
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites went down. They set Solomon upon King David's own mule and brought him to Gihon.

(1 Kings 1:39) 
Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, 'Long live King Solomon!'

(1 Kings 1:40) 
And all the multitude went up after him. The people were playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth reverberated with their shouting.

(1 Kings 1:1) 
King David was very old and advanced in years; even when he was covered with many blankets, he could not get warm.

(1 Kings 1:2) 
So his servants said to him: "Let us find a young virgin for our Lord, the king, to take care of him. She can stand before the king, sleeping close to him, and keep our Lord, the king, warm."

(1 Kings 1:3) 
So they searched throughout all the lands of Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.

(1 Kings 1:4) 
The young woman was very beautiful. She took care of the king and served him; however, the king did not have sexual relations with her.

(1 Kings 1:5) 
Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying: "I will be king." He prepared chariots and horsemen for himself, along with fifty men to run before him.

(1 Kings 1:6) 
His father, David, had never once rebuked him, asking: "Why have you done this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, and he was the next son born after Absalom.

(1 Kings 1:7) 
Adonijah spoke with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both helped Adonijah and followed him.

(1 Kings 1:8) 
However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the core of David's army were not with Adonijah.

(1 Kings 1:9) 
Then Adonijah sacrificed sheep, calves, and all the fatted animals near the Stone of Zoheleth, which was beside the En Rogel spring. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.

(1 Kings 1:10) 
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, nor any of the mighty men, nor his brother Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:11) 
Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother: "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our Lord David does not know about it?"

(1 Kings 1:12) 
Now then, come, accept my advice, and save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:13) 
Go and enter before King David. Say to him: "My Lord, the king, did you not swear to your handmaid, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'? How then is Adonijah reigning?"

(1 Kings 1:14) 
While you are still speaking there with the king, I will immediately come in after you and confirm your words.

(1 Kings 1:15) 
So Bathsheba went in to the king in his private room. The king was now very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.

(1 Kings 1:16) 
Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king. The king said to her: "What do you want?"

(1 Kings 1:17) 
She answered him: "My Lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.'"

(1 Kings 1:18) 
And now, look, Adonijah is reigning, and you, my Lord, the king, do not know it.

(1 Kings 1:19) 
He has sacrificed many oxen, fatted animals, and sheep, and he has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon, nor me, your handmaid.

(1 Kings 1:20) 
Now, my Lord, the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, for you to declare to them who shall sit on your throne, my Lord, the king, after you.

(1 Kings 1:21) 
Otherwise, when my Lord, the king, sleeps with his fathers (that is, when he dies), my son Solomon and I will be considered guilty and will suffer the consequences.

(1 Kings 1:22) 
And look, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet entered.

(1 Kings 1:23) 
They announced to the king, saying: "Nathan the prophet is here." When he had come in before the king and bowed down before him, with his face to the ground,

(1 Kings 1:24) 
Nathan said: "My Lord, the king, did you say: 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'?"

(1 Kings 1:25) 
For he went down today and sacrificed many oxen, fatted animals, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. While they are eating and drinking before him, they are shouting: "Long live King Adonijah!"

(1 Kings 1:26) 
But he did not invite me, your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.

(1 Kings 1:27) 
Has this word truly come from my Lord, the king, and you have not informed me, your servant, who should sit on your throne after you?

(1 Kings 1:28) 
King David then answered, saying: "Call Bathsheba for me." When she had come in before the king and stood before him,

(1 Kings 1:29) 
the king swore an oath and said: "As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from every distress,"

(1 Kings 1:30) 
just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my place,' I will do this very thing today.

(1 Kings 1:31) 
Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king, saying: "May my Lord, King David, live forever!"

(1 Kings 1:32) 
King David then also said: "Call for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." When they had come in before the king,

(1 Kings 1:33) 
he said to them: "Take with you the servants of your master. Have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and lead him down to Gihon."

(1 Kings 1:34) 
There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel. Then sound the trumpet and declare: "Long live King Solomon!"

(1 Kings 1:35) 
Then you shall come up after him. He will come and sit upon my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place, for I have commanded that he be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

(1 Kings 1:36) 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, saying: "Amen! May the Lord, the God of my Lord, the king, speak likewise (that is, confirm your word)."

(1 Kings 1:37) 
Just as the Lord was with my Lord, the king, so may He be with Solomon. May He make Solomon's throne even greater than the throne of my Lord, King David.

(1 Kings 1:38) 
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down. They put Solomon on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.

(1 Kings 1:39) 
Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They sounded the trumpet, and all the people shouted: "Long live King Solomon!"

(1 Kings 1:40) 
And all the multitude went up after him. The people played flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so much so that the earth resounded from the loudness of their shouting.

(1 Kings 2:1) 
As the day drew near for King David to die, he gave these final commands to Solomon, his son and successor:

(1 Kings 2:2) 
“I am about to pass from this world, like all people must. So be strong, and act like a true man.

(1 Kings 2:3) 
And faithfully keep the commandments of the Lord your God. Walk in His ways, observe His rituals, His precepts, His judgments, and His testimonies, just as it is written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in everything you undertake, and in every direction you go.

(1 Kings 2:4) 
This is so the Lord may fulfill the promise He made to me, when He said: 'If your descendants faithfully keep My ways and walk before Me in truth, with their whole heart and their whole soul, you will never lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel.'

(1 Kings 2:5) 
“You also know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me and what he did to the two commanders of the army of Israel: Abner, the son of Ner, and Amasa, the son of Jether. He murdered them, shedding the blood of war in a time of peace, and stained his belt around his waist and his sandals on his feet with the blood of war.

(1 Kings 2:6) 
Therefore, act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the abode of the dead in peace.

(1 Kings 2:7) 
But to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, show kindness. Let them be among those who eat at your table, because they showed me hospitality when I fled from your brother Absalom.

(1 Kings 2:8) 
You also have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, from Bahurim, a Benjaminite, who cursed me with a terrible curse when I was going to the camp. But because he came down with me to the Jordan River, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'

(1 Kings 2:9) 
Therefore, do not let him go unpunished. You are a wise man, and you will know how to bring his gray head down to the abode of the dead with blood.

(1 Kings 2:10) 
So David rested with his ancestors, and he was buried in the City of David.

(1 Kings 2:11) 
The length of David's reign over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 2:12) 
Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.

(1 Kings 2:13) 
Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked him, “Are you coming in peace?” He answered, “I am.”

(1 Kings 2:14) 
Then he added, “I have something to say to you.” She replied, “Speak.”

(1 Kings 2:15) 
He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel expected me to be king. But the kingdom has been taken from me and given to my brother; for it was the Lord's will that it be prepared for him.”

(1 Kings 2:16) 
“Now therefore, I ask one favor from you. Do not refuse my request.” She said to him, “Speak.”

(1 Kings 2:17) 
He said, “Please speak to King Solomon—he cannot refuse you—and ask him to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”

(1 Kings 2:18) 
Bathsheba replied, “Very well, I will speak to the king on your behalf.”

(1 Kings 2:19) 
So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah. The king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne, and a throne was placed for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.

(1 Kings 2:20) 
She said to him, “I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse my request.” The king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for it is not right that I should refuse your request.”

(1 Kings 2:21) 
Then she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”

(1 Kings 2:22) 
King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Why do you ask for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask also for the kingdom for him! He is my elder brother, and he has Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, supporting him!”

(1 Kings 2:23) 
Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, “May God do to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life by making this request!”

(1 Kings 2:24) 
“Now, as the Lord lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of my father David, and who has made me a lasting dynasty as He promised, Adonijah will surely be put to death this very day!”

(1 Kings 2:25) 
So King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who struck him down, and Adonijah died.

(1 Kings 2:26) 
To Abiathar the priest, the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own lands. You deserve to die, but today I will not put you to death, because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before my father David and endured all the hardships my father endured.”

(1 Kings 2:27) 
So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, thereby fulfilling the word of the Lord that He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

(1 Kings 2:28) 
When the news reached Joab—because Joab had sided with Adonijah and not with Solomon—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and grasped the horns of the altar, seeking sanctuary.

(1 Kings 2:29) 
It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”

(1 Kings 2:30) 
Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to Joab, “Thus says the king: 'Come out!'” But Joab replied, “No, I will not come out; I will die here.” So Benaiah reported to the king, saying, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”

(1 Kings 2:31) 
The king then said to Benaiah, “Do as he has said; strike him down and bury him. In doing so, you will remove the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed from me and from my father's house.”

(1 Kings 2:32) 
“And the Lord will bring his bloodguilt back upon his own head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself. He murdered them with the sword, though my father David knew nothing of it: Abner, the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.”

(1 Kings 2:33) 
“So their bloodguilt will fall upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house, and upon his throne, may there be lasting peace from the Lord forever.”

(1 Kings 2:34) 
So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and struck him down and killed him. He was then buried in his own house in the wilderness.

(1 Kings 2:35) 
The king then appointed Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, over the army in place of Joab, and he appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.

(1 Kings 2:36) 
The king then sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place else.”

(1 Kings 2:37) 
“For on whatever day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head.”

(1 Kings 2:38) 
Shimei said to the king, “Your word is good. Just as my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.

(1 Kings 2:39) 
Now it happened three years later that servants of Shimei ran away to Gath, to Achish, son of Maachah, the king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei, “Look, your servants are in Gath!”

(1 Kings 2:40) 
So Shimei rose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to search for his servants, and he brought them back from Gath.

(1 Kings 2:1) 
Now the days drew near when David had to die, and he gave a final command to his son Solomon, saying:

(1 Kings 2:2) 
“I am about to go the way of all the earth, the way of all humanity. So be strong now, and show yourself to be a man.

(1 Kings 2:3) 
And keep the observances of the Lord your God. Walk in His ways and keep His ceremonies, His precepts, His judgments, and His testimonies—just as it is written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may understand everything you do and everywhere you turn, and that you may prosper.

(1 Kings 2:4) 
And also that the Lord may confirm His word which He spoke concerning me, saying: 'If your sons keep their way and walk before Me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul, a man from your line shall not be cut off from the throne of Israel.'

(1 Kings 2:5) 
“You also know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me—what he did to the two commanders of the army of Israel, Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether. He killed them, shedding the blood of war in a time of peace, and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet.

(1 Kings 2:6) 
So, act according to your wisdom regarding him. Do not allow his gray hairs to go down to the underworld in peace, that is, do not let him die a natural death.

(1 Kings 2:7) 
But to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you must show kindness. Let them eat at your table, because they were there for me when I fled from your brother Absalom.

(1 Kings 2:8) 
You also have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjaminite from Bahurim. He cursed me with a terrible curse when I went to Mahanaim, the place where I gathered my forces. But because he came down with me to the Jordan River, I swore to him by the Lord, saying: 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'

(1 Kings 2:9) 
Therefore, do not leave him unpunished. But you are a wise man, and you know what you should do to him. Bring his gray hairs down to the underworld with blood, meaning, ensure he faces justice and dies a violent death.

(1 Kings 2:10) 
So David rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.

(1 Kings 2:11) 
And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 2:12) 
Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was very firmly established.

(1 Kings 2:13) 
Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked him: 'Is your coming peaceful?' And he answered: 'It is peaceful.'

(1 Kings 2:14) 
And he added: 'I have something to say to you.' At which point she said: 'Speak.'

(1 Kings 2:15) 
He said: 'You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had turned their faces toward me, expecting me to reign. But the kingdom has been transferred, and it has become my brother's, because it was established for him by the Lord.

(1 Kings 2:16) 
Now therefore, I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse my plea.' And Bathsheba said to him: 'Speak.'

(1 Kings 2:17) 
He said: 'I beg you to speak to King Solomon (for he cannot refuse you anything), that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.'

(1 Kings 2:18) 
Bathsheba said: 'Very well. I will speak to the king for you.'

(1 Kings 2:19) 
So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. A chair was placed for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.

(1 Kings 2:20) 
And she said to him: 'I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse my plea.' And the king said to her: 'Ask, my mother; for it is not right that I should refuse you.'

(1 Kings 2:21) 
She said: 'Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife.'

(1 Kings 2:22) 
And King Solomon answered and said to his mother: 'Why do you ask for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask also for the kingdom for him! For he is my older brother, and he has Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah on his side.'

(1 Kings 2:23) 
So King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: 'May God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life, thereby sealing his own doom.'

(1 Kings 2:24) 
And now, as the Lord lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of David my father, and who has made for me a house, just as He promised—Adonijah shall surely be put to death today.

(1 Kings 2:25) 
So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, who struck him down, and he died.

(1 Kings 2:26) 
And to Abiathar the priest, the king said: 'Go to Anathoth, to your own fields. You deserve death, for you are a son of death. But today I will not put you to death, because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before David my father, and you endured hardship in all the difficulties my father endured.'

(1 Kings 2:27) 
So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord. This happened so that the word of the Lord, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh, might be fulfilled.

(1 Kings 2:28) 
When the news reached Joab (for Joab had sided with Adonijah, and had not sided with Solomon), he fled to the tabernacle of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar.

(1 Kings 2:29) 
It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the Lord and was by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: 'Go and strike him down.'

(1 Kings 2:30) 
So Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord and said to him: 'Thus says the king: 'Come out!'' But Joab answered: 'No, I will not come out; I will die here.' So Benaiah reported the words to the king, saying: 'This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.'

(1 Kings 2:31) 
And the king said to him: 'Do as he has spoken. Strike him down and bury him, so that you may remove the innocent blood which Joab shed from me and from the house of my father.

(1 Kings 2:32) 
And the Lord will bring his blood back upon his own head because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself in Israel, without my father David knowing it: Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.

(1 Kings 2:33) 
Their blood shall return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, and his house, and his throne, there shall be peace and permanence forever from the Lord.'

(1 Kings 2:34) 
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

(1 Kings 2:35) 
And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's place. And Zadok the priest he appointed in the place of Abiathar.

(1 Kings 2:36) 
The king also sent and called for Shimei and said to him: 'Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there anywhere else.

(1 Kings 2:37) 
For on whatever day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head—meaning, you will be responsible for your own death.'

(1 Kings 2:38) 
And Shimei said to the king: 'The word is good. As my lord the king has spoken, so will your servant do.' So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.

(1 Kings 2:39) 
But it came to pass after three years that two servants of Shimei fled to Achish, the son of Maacah, king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei, with people saying: 'Behold, your servants are in Gath!'

(1 Kings 2:40) 
So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his servants. And he brought them back from Gath.

(1 Kings 3:1) 
Then Solomon made a political and marriage alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter as his wife and brought her to the City of David to live there until he had finished building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the city walls surrounding Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 3:2) 
However, the people were still offering sacrifices in the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship, because a proper Temple for the Lord had not yet been built in Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 3:3) 
Solomon truly loved the Lord and lived according to the commands of David his father, except for one thing: he also offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, rather than exclusively at the tabernacle.

(1 Kings 3:4) 
Therefore, the king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices there, for it was a particularly prominent high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.

(1 Kings 3:5) 
While in Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream during the night, saying: 'Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.'

(1 Kings 3:6) 
Solomon responded: 'You have shown great and enduring mercy to your servant, my father David, just as he lived before You with truth, justice, and an upright heart. And You have continued to show him Your abundant mercy by giving him a son who now sits on his throne, as is evident today.'

(1 Kings 3:7) 
And now, O Lord God, You have made me, Your servant, king in place of my father David. But I am still very young and inexperienced, and I do not know how to properly govern or lead my people.

(1 Kings 3:8) 
And I, Your servant, am placed among Your chosen people—a vast multitude that cannot be counted or numbered because of their sheer size.

(1 Kings 3:9) 
Therefore, grant to Your servant a listening and discerning heart so that I may be able to govern Your people justly and distinguish between good and evil. For who is truly capable of judging this great and numerous people of Yours?

(1 Kings 3:10) 
The Lord was pleased with Solomon's request because he had asked for such a thing—wisdom to govern.

(1 Kings 3:11) 
So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have made this specific request, and have not asked for a long life, nor for riches, nor for the death of your enemies, but instead have asked for wisdom for yourself to render proper judgment and discern what is right: '

(1 Kings 3:12) 
'Behold, I have granted your request. I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before, nor will there be anyone like you who arises after you.'

(1 Kings 3:13) 
'Furthermore, even what you did not ask for, I have given to you: great riches and abundant glory. In fact, no king among all those who lived before you will be your equal.'

(1 Kings 3:14) 
'But if you walk in My ways and keep My commands and precepts, just as your father David did, then I will also grant you a long life.'

(1 Kings 3:15) 
So Solomon awoke and realized that it had been a dream. He then returned to Jerusalem, stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. He also held a great feast for all his servants.

(1 Kings 3:16) 
At that time, two women who were prostitutes came before the king and stood in his presence.

(1 Kings 3:17) 
One of them said: 'Please, my lord, this woman and I lived together in the same house. I gave birth to a child while she was with me in the room.'

(1 Kings 3:18) 
'And on the third day after I gave birth, she also gave birth. We were alone together; there was no one else in the house with us except the two of us.'

(1 Kings 3:19) 
'But this woman's son died during the night, because she accidentally suffocated him in her sleep.'

(1 Kings 3:20) 
'So she got up in the quiet of the deep night and took my son from my side while I, your handmaid, was asleep, and laid him in her own bosom. Then she put her dead son in my bosom instead.'

(1 Kings 3:21) 
'And when I arose in the morning to nurse my son, he appeared dead. But when I looked at him closely in the daylight, I realized that he was not the son I had given birth to.'

(1 Kings 3:22) 
The other woman replied: 'No, that's not true! Your son is the one who died; my son is alive!' But the first woman insisted: 'You are lying! My son is alive, and your son is dead!' And so they argued back and forth before the king.

(1 Kings 3:23) 
Then the king said: 'This woman claims: "My son is alive, and your son is dead." And the other woman replies: "No, your son is dead, and my son is alive."'

(1 Kings 3:24) 
Then the king added: 'Bring me a sword.' And when a sword was brought before the king,

(1 Kings 3:25) 
he commanded: 'Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other.'

(1 Kings 3:26) 
Then the woman whose son was truly alive, for her heart ached for her child, said to the king: 'Please, my lord, give her the living child, and do not kill him!' But the other woman insisted: 'Let the child be neither mine nor yours; divide him!'

(1 Kings 3:27) 
The king then declared: 'Give the living child to this woman, and do not kill him, for she is truly his mother.'

(1 Kings 3:28) 
So all of Israel heard of the judgment the king had rendered, and they held the king in awe, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.

(1 Kings 3:29) 
So King Solomon was reigning over all of Israel.

(1 Kings 3:30) 
And these were the chief officials he had: Azariah, son of Zadok the priest,

(1 Kings 3:31) 
Elihoreph and Ahiah, sons of Shisha, were the secretaries; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the chancellor, responsible for royal records.

(1 Kings 3:32) 
Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in command of the army. Zadok and Abiathar served as high priests.

(1 Kings 3:33) 
Azariah, son of Nathan, was in charge of the regional governors who oversaw the tribute collection. Zabud, son of Nathan, was a priest and also the king's close friend and advisor.

(1 Kings 3:34) 
Ahishar was the supervisor of the royal palace, and Adoniram, son of Abda, was in charge of the forced labor and taxation.

(1 Kings 3:35) 
Solomon also had twelve district governors appointed over all of Israel. They were responsible for providing food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each governor was in charge of providing supplies for one month out of the year.

(1 Kings 3:36) 
Their names were: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.

(1 Kings 3:37) 
Ben-Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, Elon, and Beth-hanan.

(1 Kings 3:38) 
Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; his region included Socoh and all the land of Hepher.

(1 Kings 3:39) 
Ben-Abinadab, whose district covered all the heights of Dor. He also had Taphath, one of Solomon's daughters, as his wife.

(1 Kings 3:40) 
Baana, son of Ahilud, was in charge of Taanach and Megiddo, and all of Beth-shan, which is near Zarethan, below Jezreel, extending from Beth-shan to Abel-meholah, and even beyond Jokmeam.

(1 Kings 3:1) 
A covenant was made between Solomon and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Solomon took Pharaoh's daughter in marriage and brought her into the city of David, Jerusalem. This was until he finished building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 3:2) 
However, the people were still sacrificing in the local high places. This was because the house dedicated to the Name of the Lord—the Temple—had not yet been built by that day.

(1 Kings 3:3) 
Solomon loved the Lord, walking according to the precepts of David, his father. His only exception was that he would offer sacrifices and burn incense in the high places.

(1 Kings 3:4) 
So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the greatest of the local high places. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar.

(1 Kings 3:5) 
The Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibeon during a night dream, saying: "Ask for whatever you wish that I may give it to you."

(1 Kings 3:6) 
Solomon said: "You have shown great mercy to your servant David, my father, because he walked before You in truth, and justice, and with an upright heart. And You kept for him Your great mercy, giving him a son who sits upon his throne, even today."

(1 Kings 3:7) 
And now, O Lord, my God, You have made your servant king in place of David my father. But I am a mere child, lacking the experience to lead effectively.

(1 Kings 3:8) 
And your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen—an immense people, so numerous that they cannot be counted or tallied.

(1 Kings 3:9) 
Therefore, give your servant a docile heart, one capable of learning and understanding Your will, so that he may be able to judge Your people and discern between good and evil. For who can truly judge this great people of Yours?

(1 Kings 3:10) 
And the Lord was pleased with what Solomon said, because he had asked for such a thing.

(1 Kings 3:11) 
And the Lord said to Solomon: "Because you have asked for this, and you have not asked for a long life for yourself, nor riches, nor the lives of your enemies, but rather you have asked for wisdom to discern judgment:

(1 Kings 3:12) 
Behold, I have done for you according to your words. I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall anyone like you rise after you.

(1 Kings 3:13) 
But also what you did not ask for, I have given to you: namely, riches and glory. This is so that no one among kings shall be like you in all your days.

(1 Kings 3:14) 
If, however, you walk in My ways and keep My precepts and My commandments, just as David your father walked, I will make your days long.

(1 Kings 3:15) 
So Solomon awoke and understood that it had been a dream. He then came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and then gave a feast for all his servants.

(1 Kings 3:16) 
Then two women, who were prostitutes, came to the king and stood before him.

(1 Kings 3:17) 
One of them said: "Please, my lord, this woman and I lived in one house. I gave birth while she was with me in the bedchamber."

(1 Kings 3:18) 
"On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together, and there was no one else with us in the house except for us two."

(1 Kings 3:19) 
"Now the son of this woman died in the night, for she lay upon him while sleeping."

(1 Kings 3:20) 
"And rising in the deep silence of the night, she took my son from my side, your handmaid, while I was sleeping, and placed him in her bosom. But her own son, who was dead, she placed in my bosom."

(1 Kings 3:21) 
"When I arose in the morning to give milk to my son, he was dead. But when I looked at him more carefully and paid attention, I realized that he was not my son, the one I had given birth to."

(1 Kings 3:22) 
The other woman answered: "It is not as you say; rather, your son is dead, and mine lives." And the first woman countered: "You lie! My son lives, and your son is dead." And so they argued before the king.

(1 Kings 3:23) 
And the king said: "This woman says: 'My son lives, and your son is dead.' And that woman answers: 'No, but your son is dead, and my son lives.'"

(1 Kings 3:24) 
Therefore, the king commanded: "Bring me a sword!" And when they had brought a sword before the king,

(1 Kings 3:25) 
He commanded: "Divide the living infant into two parts, and give one part to one woman, and the other part to the other."

(1 Kings 3:26) 
And the woman whose son was alive responded to the king—for her compassion was deeply stirred for her son: "Please, my lord, give her the living infant, and do not kill him!" But the other woman said: "Let him be neither mine nor yours, but let him be divided!"

(1 Kings 3:27) 
The king answered and said: "Give this woman the living infant, and do not kill him. She is his true mother."

(1 Kings 3:28) 
Therefore, all Israel heard the judgment that the king had rendered. And they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to render such judgment.

(1 Kings 3:1) 
Now, when the reign of King Solomon was established and secure, he married the daughter of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He brought her to live in the City of David until he could complete building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the protective wall around Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 3:2) 
However, the people were still offering sacrifices at various high places throughout the land, because a dedicated Temple to the Lord had not yet been built for His name, not even up to that day.

(1 Kings 3:3) 
Solomon loved the Lord and walked according to the commands of David, his father. However, he himself also sacrificed and burned incense at those high places.

(1 Kings 3:4) 
So the king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices there, because that particular place was a great high place for worship. Solomon offered a thousand whole burnt offerings upon that altar.

(1 Kings 3:5) 
While he was at Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream during the night, saying, 'Ask what you desire, and I will give it to you.'

(1 Kings 3:6) 
Solomon answered, 'You have shown great mercy to Your servant David, my father, because he walked before You in truth, in justice, and with a sincere heart. You have also kept Your great mercy for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, which is as it is this very day.'

(1 Kings 3:7) 
And now, O Lord God, You have made Your servant king in place of David, my father. But I am merely a young man, inexperienced in leadership, and do not know how to carry out my royal duties.

(1 Kings 3:8) 
And Your servant is in the midst of Your chosen people—an immense population that cannot be numbered or counted because of their great multitude.

(1 Kings 3:9) 
Therefore, give to Your servant an understanding and discerning heart, so that I may be able to judge Your people properly and distinguish between good and evil. For who is truly able to judge this immense people of Yours?

(1 Kings 3:10) 
The Lord was pleased with this request, because Solomon had asked for such a thing.

(1 Kings 3:11) 
The Lord said to Solomon, 'Because you have made this request, and have not asked for yourself a long life, nor riches, nor the deaths of your enemies, but instead have asked for wisdom to discern and administer justice—'

(1 Kings 3:12) 
—behold, I have granted your request. I have given you such a wise and understanding heart that there has been no one like you before, nor will there be anyone like you afterward.'

(1 Kings 3:13) 
'Moreover, I have also given you what you did not ask for—namely, riches and glory—to such an extent that no other king will be your equal throughout your entire life.'

(1 Kings 3:14) 
'Furthermore, if you walk in My ways and keep My precepts and My commandments, just as your father David walked, then I will grant you a long life.'

(1 Kings 3:15) 
Then Solomon awoke and understood that it had been a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He offered whole burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings, and then he held a feast for all his servants.

(1 Kings 3:16) 
After these events, two prostitutes came before the king and stood there in his presence.

(1 Kings 3:17) 
One of them said, 'Please, my lord, this woman and I lived in the same house. While we were there, I gave birth to a child with her in the house.'

(1 Kings 3:18) 
Then, on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were alone together in the house; there was no one else with us, only the two of us.

(1 Kings 3:19) 
But this woman's son died during the night, because she accidentally overlaid him while she was sleeping.

(1 Kings 3:20) 
Then she rose in the middle of the night, while I, Your handmaid, was sleeping. She took my son from my side and laid him in her own bosom. And her own son, who was already dead, she laid in my bosom instead.

(1 Kings 3:21) 
When I arose in the morning to nurse my son, I found him dead. But when I looked at him closely and carefully, I realized that he was not the son I had given birth to.

(1 Kings 3:22) 
The other woman replied, 'No, that is not true! This living child is my son, and your son is the one who is dead.' But the first woman insisted, 'You are lying! My son is alive, and your son is dead.' And so, they argued back and forth before the king.

(1 Kings 3:23) 
The king then said, 'This woman claims, "My son is alive, and your son is dead." And that woman replies, "No, your son is dead, and my son is alive."'

(1 Kings 3:24) 
The king then added, 'Bring me a sword!' So, they brought a sword into the king’s presence.

(1 Kings 3:25) 
He commanded, 'Cut the living infant in two, and give one half to one woman and the other half to the other.'

(1 Kings 3:26) 
Then the woman whose son was truly alive—for her heart was deeply moved with compassion for her son—spoke to the king, saying, 'Please, my lord, give the living infant to her! Do not kill him!' But the other woman declared, 'Let him be neither mine nor yours. Divide him!'

(1 Kings 3:27) 
Then the king gave the command, saying, 'Give the living infant to this woman, and do not kill him, for she is truly his mother.'

(1 Kings 3:28) 
So all Israel heard the judgment that the king had pronounced, and they stood in awe of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.

(1 Kings 4:1) 
Therefore, King Solomon was the ruler over all of Israel.

(1 Kings 4:2) 
These were his chief officials: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest.

(1 Kings 4:3) 
Elioreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, were scribes. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the royal recorder.

(1 Kings 4:4) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the army. Zadok and Abiathar were priests.

(1 Kings 4:5) 
Azariah, the son of Nathan, was in charge of those appointed over individual administrative duties. Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and a friend of the king.

(1 Kings 4:6) 
Ahisar was the chief steward of the palace. Adoniram, the son of Abda, was responsible for the forced labor levy.

(1 Kings 4:7) 
Solomon also had twelve district governors over all Israel. They supplied provisions for the king and his household. Each one supplied food for one month of the year.

(1 Kings 4:8) 
And these are their names: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.

(1 Kings 4:9) 
Ben-Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-Shemesh, Elon, and Beth-Hanan.

(1 Kings 4:10) 
Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth. To him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher.

(1 Kings 4:11) 
Ben-Abinadab, whose district was all of Naphath-Dor. He had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.

(1 Kings 4:12) 
Baana, the son of Ahilud, was in Taanach and Megiddo and in all of Beth-Shan which is next to Zarethan, below Jezreel; from Beth-Shan up to Abel-Meholah, opposite Jokmeam.

(1 Kings 4:13) 
Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-Gilead. To him belonged the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead. Also, the region of Argob which is in Bashan belonged to him; it had sixty large, fortified cities with bronze gates.

(1 Kings 4:14) 
Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, was the governor of Mahanaim.

(1 Kings 4:15) 
Ahimaaz, in Naphtali. He also had Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.

(1 Kings 4:16) 
Baana, the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth.

(1 Kings 4:17) 
Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar.

(1 Kings 4:18) 
Shimei, the son of Elah, in Benjamin.

(1 Kings 4:19) 
Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Gilead, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan. He was the sole governor in that region.

(1 Kings 4:20) 
Judah and Israel were countless, like the sand of the sea in multitude. They were eating and drinking and rejoicing.

(1 Kings 4:21) 
Now Solomon held sway over all the kingdoms, from the River Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. They presented gifts to him and served him all the days of his life.

(1 Kings 4:22) 
Solomon’s provisions for each day were thirty cori of fine flour and sixty cori of meal,

(1 Kings 4:23) 
along with ten fattened oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, and one hundred sheep. This was in addition to a multitude of deer, gazelles, wild game, and fattened fowl.

(1 Kings 4:24) 
For he ruled over all the region beyond the River Euphrates, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, and over all the kings of those regions. And he had peace on every side, all around.

(1 Kings 4:25) 
Judah and Israel lived securely, each one under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.

(1 Kings 4:26) 
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls for chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses.

(1 Kings 4:27) 
Those district governors supplied him with provisions, each one for his month, according to what was appointed for him, so that nothing would be lacking from what was due to the king.

(1 Kings 4:28) 
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and other beasts of burden to the place where the king was, according to what was appointed for them.

(1 Kings 4:29) 
God also gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and a breadth of mind like the sand which is on the seashore.

(1 Kings 4:30) 
And Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the Egyptians.

(1 Kings 4:31) 
And he was wiser than all people; wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And he was renowned among all the surrounding nations.

(1 Kings 4:32) 
He also spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five.

(1 Kings 4:33) 
He spoke about trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He also spoke about animals, birds, creeping things, and fish.

(1 Kings 4:34) 
And people came from all nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

(1 Kings 4:1) 
Therefore, King Solomon was the king over all the nation of Israel.

(1 Kings 4:2) 
These were the chief officials Solomon had serving him: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest.

(1 Kings 4:3) 
Elihoreph and Ahia, the sons of Shisha, were the royal secretaries. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was in charge of chronicling the kingdom's history.

(1 Kings 4:4) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, commanded the army. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.

(1 Kings 4:5) 
Azariah, the son of Nathan, was the chief officer over those who governed the twelve tribes. Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and the king's trusted personal advisor.

(1 Kings 4:6) 
Ahisar was in charge of the royal household, overseeing the palace. And Adoniram, the son of Abda, managed the forced labor and taxes.

(1 Kings 4:7) 
Now Solomon had twelve district governors appointed over all of Israel. Their duty was to provide food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each of these officials, in turn, was responsible for the provisions during one month of the year.

(1 Kings 4:8) 
And these were their names: Ben-Hur was the governor in the hill country of Ephraim.

(1 Kings 4:9) 
Ben-Dekar was the governor in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, Elon, and Beth-hanan.

(1 Kings 4:10) 
Ben-Hesed was the governor in Arubboth. He was in charge of Socoh and all the land of Hepher.

(1 Kings 4:11) 
Ben-Abinadab was the governor of all Naphath-Dor. He had as his wife Basemath, Solomon's daughter.

(1 Kings 4:12) 
Baana, the son of Ahilud, was the governor in Taanach and Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean, which is near Zarethan, below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, and across the Jordan River.

(1 Kings 4:13) 
Ben-Geber was the governor in Ramoth-Gilead. He was responsible for the tent villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead. He was also in charge of the region of Argob in Bashan, which contained sixty large, fortified cities with gates secured by bronze bars.

(1 Kings 4:14) 
Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, was the governor in Mahanaim.

(1 Kings 4:15) 
Ahimaaz was the governor in Naphtali. He also married Basemath, Solomon's daughter.

(1 Kings 4:16) 
Baana, the son of Hushai, was the governor in Asher and Aloth.

(1 Kings 4:17) 
Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, was the governor in Issachar.

(1 Kings 4:18) 
Shimei, the son of Elah, was the governor in Benjamin.

(1 Kings 4:19) 
Geber, the son of Uri, was the governor in the land of Gilead, in the territory of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan. He alone was the governor over that consolidated region.

(1 Kings 4:20) 
The people of Judah and Israel were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They were prosperous, eating and drinking, and rejoicing in their safety.

(1 Kings 4:21) 
King Solomon held dominion over all the kingdoms from the great Euphrates River down to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt. These nations presented him with gifts and served him throughout his entire life.

(1 Kings 4:22) 
For each day, the food provisions for Solomon's court were thirty measures of fine flour and sixty measures of coarser meal.

(1 Kings 4:23) 
This included ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, not including the vast numbers of deer, gazelles, roebucks, and specially fattened birds that were also consumed.

(1 Kings 4:24) 
Indeed, he held sway over the entire region west of the great Euphrates River, from Tiphsah all the way to Gaza, and over all the kings of those surrounding lands. Thus, he maintained peace on all sides of his dominion.

(1 Kings 4:25) 
Therefore, the people of Judah and Israel lived in great security, each person dwelling peacefully under his own vine and fig tree—a sign of prosperity—from the northern city of Dan all the way to Beersheba in the south, for all of Solomon's days.

(1 Kings 4:26) 
Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for the horses used for his chariots, and he maintained twelve thousand horsemen in his cavalry.

(1 Kings 4:27) 
The aforementioned district governors provided the provisions for King Solomon and for all who ate at his table, each in his own month, ensuring that nothing was lacking.

(1 Kings 4:28) 
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and for the other draft animals to the location where the king was staying, each governor according to his specific assignment.

(1 Kings 4:29) 
Moreover, God granted Solomon immense wisdom and very great understanding, along with an expansive breadth of mind, as vast as the sand on the seashore.

(1 Kings 4:30) 
Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.

(1 Kings 4:31) 
He was wiser than all other people, even wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Chalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame for wisdom spread throughout all the surrounding nations.

(1 Kings 4:32) 
He also uttered three thousand proverbs and composed five thousand songs.

(1 Kings 4:33) 
He spoke extensively about all forms of plant life, from the magnificent cedar of Lebanon to the humble hyssop that grows from a wall. He also discoursed on animals of the land, birds of the air, creeping creatures, and fish of the sea.

(1 Kings 4:34) 
People came from all nations to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and kings from all over the earth sent envoys who had heard of his profound understanding.

(1 Kings 4:1) 
So King Solomon was reigning over all of Israel.

(1 Kings 4:2) 
These were the chief officers he had: Azarias, the son of Sadoc, was the priest.

(1 Kings 4:3) 
Elihoreph and Ahia, the sons of Sisa, were the scribes, responsible for royal records; and Josaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the chancellor, managing state affairs.

(1 Kings 4:4) 
Banaias, the son of Jojada, was in command of the army; and Sadoc and Abiathar were the chief priests.

(1 Kings 4:5) 
Azarias, the son of Nathan, was in charge of all the officers appointed over various duties; and Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and a trusted friend of the king.

(1 Kings 4:6) 
Ahisar was the prefect of the royal palace, managing the household; and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was in charge of collecting all the taxes and tribute.

(1 Kings 4:7) 
Solomon also had twelve officers appointed over all of Israel, whose duty was to provide food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each of these officers would provide the necessary provisions for one month of the year.

(1 Kings 4:8) 
And these were their names and their assigned districts: Benhur was in the mountainous region of Ephraim.

(1 Kings 4:9) 
Bendecar was in Macces, and in Saalabim, and Bethsames, and Elon Bethanan.

(1 Kings 4:10) 
Benhesed was in Aruboth; his district included Socho and all the land of Epher.

(1 Kings 4:11) 
Benabinadab had responsibility for all of Nephath Dor. He also had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.

(1 Kings 4:12) 
Bana, the son of Ahilud, was responsible for Thanac and Mageddo, and all of Bethsan, which is near Sarthana, below Jezrahel, stretching from Bethsan all the way to Abelmehula, opposite Jecmaan.

(1 Kings 4:13) 
Bengaber was in Ramoth Galaad; he also controlled the Avoth Jair, the villages belonging to the sons of Manasse in Galaad. His region was Argob, which is in Basan, consisting of sixty large, walled cities, each with bronze gate-bolts.

(1 Kings 4:14) 
Ahinadab, the son of Addo, was the officer for Maanaim.

(1 Kings 4:15) 
Achimaas was in Nephthali; he, too, had taken Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.

(1 Kings 4:16) 
Baana, the son of Husai, was in Aser and Baloth.

(1 Kings 4:17) 
Josaphat, the son of Pharue, was in Issachar.

(1 Kings 4:18) 
Semei, the son of Ela, was in Benjamin.

(1 Kings 4:19) 
Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Galaad, which was the territory of Sehon, king of the Amorrhaei, and Og, king of Basan; he was the only officer appointed over that land.

(1 Kings 4:20) 
The people of Juda and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they were eating and drinking and living in joy.

(1 Kings 4:21) 
Solomon was reigning over all the kingdoms, holding dominion from the great River (the Euphrates), through the land of the Philistines, and all the way to the border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered him tribute and served him all the days of his life.

(1 Kings 4:22) 
Solomon’s daily provisions were an immense amount: thirty *chori* of fine flour and sixty *chori* of regular flour. (A *chorus* was a large measure, approximately 60 gallons).

(1 Kings 4:23) 
Also, ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred rams were provided, in addition to many deer, gazelles, wild oxen, and fattened birds.

(1 Kings 4:24) 
For he ruled over all the region beyond the great River, from Thaphsa all the way to Gaza, and over all the kings of those surrounding regions. He enjoyed peace on every side.

(1 Kings 4:25) 
Throughout all the days of Solomon’s reign, the people of Juda and Israel lived in safety and peace, each person secure under his own vine and fig tree, from the northernmost city of Dan to the southernmost city of Bersabee.

(1 Kings 4:26) 
Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horses for his cavalry.

(1 Kings 4:27) 
The aforementioned officers would each, in their assigned month, provide the food supplies for King Solomon and for all who came to his table, ensuring that nothing was ever lacking.

(1 Kings 4:28) 
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and other draft animals to the place where the king resided, according to their assigned duty.

(1 Kings 4:29) 
God also gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and a breadth of mind as vast as the sand on the seashore.

(1 Kings 4:30) 
Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of the Egyptians.

(1 Kings 4:31) 
Indeed, he was wiser than all other men; he was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalchol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame for wisdom spread throughout all the surrounding nations.

(1 Kings 4:32) 
He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered five thousand.

(1 Kings 4:33) 
He discoursed about all kinds of plant life, from the magnificent cedar that grows in Libanus down to the humble hyssop that sprouts from a wall. He also spoke extensively about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.

(1 Kings 4:34) 
So people came from all nations to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

(1 Kings 5:1) 
Hiram, King of Tyre, sent his servants to King Solomon after hearing that Solomon had been anointed king in place of his father, King David. This was because Hiram had always been a loyal friend to David.

(1 Kings 5:2) 
Solomon then sent a message to Hiram, saying:

(1 Kings 5:3) 
You know that my father David wanted to build a Temple for the Lord his God, but he could not because of the wars that surrounded him. God prevented him until the Lord made all his enemies subject to him.

(1 Kings 5:4) 
But now the Lord my God has given me peace on all sides; there is no adversary, and no evil threatens my kingdom.

(1 Kings 5:5) 
Therefore, I intend to build a Temple for the Lord my God, just as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying: ‘Your son, whom I will place on your throne in your stead, he shall build a house for my Name.’

(1 Kings 5:6) 
Therefore, command your workers to cut down cedar trees from Lebanon for me. My workers will join your workers, and I will pay you whatever wages you determine for your workers. For you know that there is no one among my people who can cut timber as skillfully as the Sidonians and Tyrians.

(1 Kings 5:7) 
When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he rejoiced greatly and said: 'Blessed be the Lord today, who has given David a most wise son to rule over this great people!'

(1 Kings 5:8) 
Hiram then sent this message back to Solomon: 'I have heard what you commanded me. I will fulfill all your wishes concerning cedar timber and fir timber.'

(1 Kings 5:9) 
My workers will bring the timber down from Lebanon to the sea. I will then bind them into rafts on the sea and transport them to whatever location you specify. There I will unload them, and you may take them. My only condition is that you provide provisions for my household in return.

(1 Kings 5:10) 
Therefore, Hiram provided King Solomon with cedar timber and fir timber, supplying everything Solomon desired.

(1 Kings 5:11) 
In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat to feed his household, and twenty thousand measures of pure olive oil. Solomon supplied these to Hiram every single year.

(1 Kings 5:12) 
The Lord also gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two kings made a formal treaty together.

(1 Kings 5:13) 
King Solomon drafted workers from all of Israel; this forced labor amounted to thirty thousand men.

(1 Kings 5:14) 
He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand men each month. This meant they would work one month in Lebanon and then be at home for two months. Adoniram was in charge of this forced labor.

(1 Kings 5:15) 
Solomon also had seventy thousand men who carried burdens and eighty thousand stonecutters working in the mountains.

(1 Kings 5:16) 
This was in addition to the three thousand three hundred overseers whom Solomon had appointed over the work. These overseers were in charge of the workers and supervised the preparations for the construction.

(1 Kings 5:17) 
The king also commanded them to bring large, carefully selected stones for the Temple’s foundation and to prepare them by squaring them.

(1 Kings 5:18) 
The stonecutters of Solomon and Hiram, along with the Giblites, quarried and shaped these stones. They prepared both the timber and the stones for the construction of the Temple.

(1 Kings 5:1) 
And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to King Solomon, because Hiram had heard that they had anointed Solomon as king in his father's place. Hiram had been King David's friend throughout his life.

(1 Kings 5:2) 
Solomon, in turn, sent a message to Hiram, saying:

(1 Kings 5:3) 
You know the desire of my father, David, and how he was unable to build a temple dedicated to the Name of the Lord his God. This was because of the wars that surrounded him, until the Lord completely subdued his enemies.

(1 Kings 5:4) 
But now the Lord my God has given me peace on every side. There is no adversary, and there are no threats of harm.

(1 Kings 5:5) 
Therefore, I intend to build a temple dedicated to the Name of the Lord my God, just as the Lord spoke to my father, David, saying: 'Your son, whom I will establish on your throne in your place, will himself build a temple dedicated to My Name.'

(1 Kings 5:6) 
So then, command your people to cut down cedar trees from Lebanon for me. My servants will work alongside your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you determine. For you know that there is no one among my people who is skilled at cutting timber as well as the Sidonians are.

(1 Kings 5:7) 
When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he was overjoyed and exclaimed, 'Blessed be the Lord today, who has given David such a wise son to rule over this great people!'

(1 Kings 5:8) 
Then Hiram sent word back to Solomon, saying: 'I have heard what you requested of me. I will fulfill all your desires regarding the cedar and fir timbers.'

(1 Kings 5:9) 
My servants will bring the timbers down from Lebanon to the sea. Then I will bind them into rafts on the sea and tow them to the location you specify for me. There, I will have them disassembled, and you can take them. In return, you will provide food supplies for my royal household.

(1 Kings 5:10) 
So Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar timbers and fir timbers, just as he had desired.

(1 Kings 5:11) 
Solomon, in turn, gave Hiram twenty thousand *cori* (an ancient unit of measure) of wheat as provisions for his royal household, and twenty thousand *cori* of the purest olive oil. Solomon gave these provisions to Hiram each and every year.

(1 Kings 5:12) 
The Lord also granted Solomon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two kings made a formal treaty together.

(1 Kings 5:13) 
Then King Solomon raised a forced labor levy from all of Israel, and this levy consisted of thirty thousand men.

(1 Kings 5:14) 
He sent these men to Lebanon, ten thousand each month in rotation. This arrangement meant that for two months they were in their own homes, and then for the third month, they were in Lebanon. Adoniram was the overseer of this forced labor levy.

(1 Kings 5:15) 
Solomon also had seventy thousand men who carried heavy loads and eighty thousand stonecutters working in the hill country.

(1 Kings 5:16) 
This was in addition to the two hundred and fifty chief overseers who were in charge of each of Solomon's work crews. These overseers pressed the people and ensured the work progressed quickly.

(1 Kings 5:17) 
The king commanded them to quarry large, choice stones, and to prepare them as squared stones, for the foundation of the temple.

(1 Kings 5:18) 
And so, Solomon's skilled workers, along with Hiram's skilled workers and the Giblites, hewed and prepared the timbers and stones, all in readiness for the building of the temple.

(1 Kings 6:1) 
Now it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel departed from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziph—which is the second month of the year—that he began to build the House for the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:2) 
The House that King Solomon was building for the Lord had a length of sixty cubits, a width of twenty cubits, and a height of thirty cubits.

(1 Kings 6:3) 
And there was a portico in front of the Temple, twenty cubits long—matching the width of the House—and ten cubits wide, extending out from the front of the House.

(1 Kings 6:4) 
And he made narrow, recessed windows in the Temple.

(1 Kings 6:5) 
And he built side chambers—or stories—around the outer walls of the House, making ledges all around.

(1 Kings 6:6) 
The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one six cubits wide, and the third story seven cubits wide; for indeed, the outer wall of the House was recessed all around, so that the supporting beams would not have to be fastened into the walls of the House itself.

(1 Kings 6:7) 
And when the House was being built, it was constructed from carefully cut and perfectly finished stones; so that no sound of hammer, axe, or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built.

(1 Kings 6:8) 
The entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the House, and a winding staircase led up to the middle story, and from the middle story up to the third.

(1 Kings 6:9) 
And he built the House, and he finished it; and he covered the House with ceilings—constructed of cedar planks.

(1 Kings 6:10) 
And he built the stories around the entire House, each five cubits high; and he joined the House with cedar planks for these stories.

(1 Kings 6:11) 
Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:

(1 Kings 6:12) 
Concerning this House that you are building: if you walk in my precepts, and carry out my judgments, and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will confirm my word to you, which I spoke to David your father.

(1 Kings 6:13) 
And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will not forsake my people Israel.

(1 Kings 6:14) 
Therefore, Solomon built the House, and he finished it.

(1 Kings 6:15) 
And he built the inner walls of the House with cedar planks, from the floor of the House up to the ceilings, paneling the interior with wood; and he laid the floor of the House with planks of fir wood.

(1 Kings 6:16) 
And at the rear of the House, he built a partition of cedar planks twenty cubits high from the floor to the ceiling; and he made within it the Inner Sanctuary, that is, the Holy of Holies.

(1 Kings 6:17) 
The main part of the House—that is, the Temple proper before the Inner Sanctuary—was fifty cubits long.

(1 Kings 6:18) 
And all the interior of the entire House was covered with cedar planks, decorated with carvings and engravings, with twisted designs and various patterns, both raised and flat.

(1 Kings 6:19) 
And he prepared the Inner Sanctuary in the middle of the House’s interior, to place there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:20) 
Furthermore, the Inner Sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; and he covered it with pure gold; and he placed an altar before the Inner Sanctuary and covered it with gold.

(1 Kings 6:21) 
And Solomon covered the interior of the House with pure gold, and he placed gold chains before the Inner Sanctuary, and he covered it—the Inner Sanctuary—with gold.

(1 Kings 6:22) 
And there was nothing in the entire House that was not covered with gold; even the whole altar of the Inner Sanctuary he covered with gold.

(1 Kings 6:23) 
And in the Inner Sanctuary, he made two cherubim—angelic figures—of olive wood, each ten cubits high.

(1 Kings 6:24) 
One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits long; that is, it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.

(1 Kings 6:25) 
Likewise, the second cherub also had ten cubits in wing span; the measurement was equal, and the craftsmanship was equal for both cherubim.

(1 Kings 6:26) 
One cherub had a height of ten cubits, and likewise the other cherub.

(1 Kings 6:27) 
And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple; and the cherubim spread out their wings, so that one wing touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their remaining wings touched each other in the middle of the Temple.

(1 Kings 6:28) 
He also covered the cherubim completely with gold.

(1 Kings 6:29) 
And he carved all the walls of the House all around with various engravings and lathe work, both inside and outside; and he made cherubim, and palm trees, and various sculptured designs, appearing as if raised from the walls.

(1 Kings 6:30) 
And he also covered the floor of the House with gold, both inside and outside.

(1 Kings 6:31) 
And for the entrance of the Inner Sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood; and the doorposts and side panels formed five-sided frames.

(1 Kings 6:32) 
And there were two doors of olive wood; and he engraved and carved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and very prominent decorative figures; and he covered everything with gold, both the cherubim and the palm trees.

(1 Kings 6:33) 
And for the entrance of the main Temple area, he made doorposts of olive wood, having four distinct angles.

(1 Kings 6:34) 
And there were two doors made of fir wood, carved and engraved, which opened—and the two sides of their hinges folded back.

(1 Kings 6:35) 
And he engraved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and very prominent engravings; and he covered everything with gold sheets.

(1 Kings 6:36) 
And he built the inner court with three courses of polished stones and one course of cedar beams.

(1 Kings 6:37) 
In the fourth year, in the month of Ziph, the House of the Lord was founded.

(1 Kings 6:38) 
And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul—which is the eighth month—the House was finished in all its work, and in all that pertained to it; and he built it in seven years.

(1 Kings 6:1) 
It happened then, four hundred and eighty years after the children of Israel left the land of Egypt—specifically in the second month, which is called Ziph—and in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel: Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:2) 
The Temple that King Solomon built for the Lord had a length of sixty cubits, a width of twenty cubits, and a height of thirty cubits.

(1 Kings 6:3) 
The entrance porch in front of the main Temple structure was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the Temple itself. This porch extended ten cubits out from the Temple’s main front wall.

(1 Kings 6:4) 
And for the Temple, he made windows with recessed frames.

(1 Kings 6:5) 
He also built side chambers against the walls of the Temple, all around the structure. These side chambers extended around the outer walls of both the main sanctuary and the inner Holy of Holies. He structured these rooms in a circular arrangement.

(1 Kings 6:6) 
The lowest story of these side chambers was five cubits wide. The middle story was six cubits wide, and the third story was seven cubits wide. This widening allowed for a set of stairs to be placed along the outside of the Temple structure. This design ensured that the supporting beams for the side chambers did not need to be inserted into the walls of the main Temple itself.

(1 Kings 6:7) 
When the Temple was being built, it was constructed from stones that had been completely cut and prepared at the quarry. No hammer, ax, or any other iron tool was heard on the site while the Temple was under construction.

(1 Kings 6:8) 
The entrance to the middle side chamber was on the right side of the Temple. People would ascend by a winding staircase to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third story.

(1 Kings 6:9) 
So Solomon built the Temple and completed its construction. He covered the Temple with ceiling panels made from cedar planks.

(1 Kings 6:10) 
He also built the side chambers all around the Temple structure, each five cubits high, and he covered the Temple’s exterior with cedar wood.

(1 Kings 6:11) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:

(1 Kings 6:12) 
“Concerning this Temple that you are building: if you walk in My commandments, and execute My judgments, and keep all My precepts by walking in them, then I will fulfill My promise to you, which I spoke to David your father.

(1 Kings 6:13) 
I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will not forsake My people Israel.”

(1 Kings 6:14) 
So Solomon continued to build the Temple, and he completed it.

(1 Kings 6:15) 
Inside the Temple, he built the walls with cedar planks, from the floor of the Temple up to the ceiling. He covered the interior with wood and laid the floor of the Temple with cypress planks.

(1 Kings 6:16) 
And for twenty cubits at the back part of the Temple, he built a partition with cedar planks, from the floor all the way up. This created the inner sanctuary, which is the Holy of Holies, as an inner space within the Temple of the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:17) 
The main sanctuary in front of the Holy of Holies measured forty cubits in length.

(1 Kings 6:18) 
The entire interior of the Temple was cedar, carved with intricate designs and ornamental flower buds. No stone was visible at all; everything was covered with wood.

(1 Kings 6:19) 
And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the innermost part of the Temple, so that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord could be placed there.

(1 Kings 6:20) 
The Holy of Holies itself was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He covered it with pure gold plates, and he placed an altar in front of this inner sanctuary.

(1 Kings 6:21) 
Solomon covered the entire interior of the Temple with the purest gold. He hung gold chains across the front of the Holy of Holies and also covered it with gold.

(1 Kings 6:22) 
There was nothing in the Temple that was not covered with gold; even the entire altar belonging to the Holy of Holies he covered with gold.

(1 Kings 6:23) 
And in the Holy of Holies, he made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits high.

(1 Kings 6:24) 
One wing of a cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was also five cubits long. This means that from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing, each cherub measured ten cubits across.

(1 Kings 6:25) 
The other cherub also was ten cubits high; its measurements were the same, and the craftsmanship for both cherubim was identical.

(1 Kings 6:26) 
That is to say, each cherub measured ten cubits in height.

(1 Kings 6:27) 
And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple, which is the Holy of Holies. The cherubim spread out their wings, so that one wing of the first cherub touched one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the opposite wall. Their other two wings met in the middle of the Holy of Holies, joining one another.

(1 Kings 6:28) 
He also covered the cherubim with gold.

(1 Kings 6:29) 
And all the walls of the Temple around its perimeter, both within and without, he decorated. He carved various designs and sculptures upon them, including cherubim, palm trees, and ornate open flower carvings, all around.

(1 Kings 6:30) 
He also covered the floor of the Temple with gold, both inside the inner sanctuary and in the outer sanctuary.

(1 Kings 6:31) 
And for the entrance to the Holy of Holies, he made doors from olive wood, with doorposts and doorframes forming five distinct angles.

(1 Kings 6:32) 
These two olive wood doors were carved with cherubim, palm trees, and carved open flower designs. He covered all of them with gold—both the cherubim and the palm trees and the other carvings.

(1 Kings 6:33) 
And for the entrance to the main Temple sanctuary, he made doorposts of olive wood, shaped into a four-angled frame.

(1 Kings 6:34) 
And there were two doors of cypress wood, each consisting of two folding panels that could swing open or fold back.

(1 Kings 6:35) 
And he carved cherubim, palm trees, and intricate flower designs on these doors. He covered all of them entirely with gold plates.

(1 Kings 6:36) 
He also built the inner courtyard with three courses of finely cut stones and one course of cedar beams.

(1 Kings 6:37) 
In the fourth year, in the month of Ziph, the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was laid.

(1 Kings 6:38) 
And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul—which is the eighth month—the Temple was completely finished in all its work and in all its preparation. Solomon built it in seven years.

(1 Kings 6:1) 
Now it was in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel had departed from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziph (which is the second month of the year), that King Solomon began to build the sacred dwelling for the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:2) 
The sacred dwelling that King Solomon was building for the Lord was sixty cubits (approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters per cubit) in length, twenty cubits in width, and thirty cubits in height.

(1 Kings 6:3) 
And the porch in front of the Temple building was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the Temple building itself, and it extended ten cubits in width in front of the main façade of the Temple.

(1 Kings 6:4) 
And King Solomon made windows with latticework within the Temple building.

(1 Kings 6:5) 
And he built side chambers surrounding the wall of the Temple, against the walls of the sacred dwelling all around, both for the main sanctuary and for the inner oracle, creating additional structures along the perimeter.

(1 Kings 6:6) 
The lowest side chamber was five cubits wide, the middle one six cubits wide, and the third seven cubits wide. This was because he had made ledges on the outside wall of the sacred dwelling all around, so that the supporting beams would not have to be fastened into the Temple walls themselves.

(1 Kings 6:7) 
And when the sacred dwelling was being built, the stones were brought to the site already hewn and perfectly shaped. No hammer, no axe, and no iron tool of any kind was heard at the building site while the Temple was being constructed.

(1 Kings 6:8) 
The entrance to the middle side chamber was on the right side of the sacred dwelling, and a winding staircase led up to the middle chamber, and from the middle chamber up to the third.

(1 Kings 6:9) 
So King Solomon built the sacred dwelling and brought it to completion. He then covered the roof of the sacred dwelling with ceiling beams and boards made of cedar wood.

(1 Kings 6:10) 
And he built the entire upper story, which was five cubits in height, connecting it to the main structure with cedar planks.

(1 Kings 6:11) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:

(1 Kings 6:12) 
“Regarding this sacred dwelling that you are building: if you walk in My precepts, and you execute My judgments, and you keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will establish My promise with you, which I spoke to David your father.

(1 Kings 6:13) 
And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will not forsake My people, Israel.”

(1 Kings 6:14) 
Therefore, Solomon continued to build the sacred dwelling, and he brought it to completion.

(1 Kings 6:15) 
And he built the inner walls of the sacred dwelling with cedar planks, from the floor of the dwelling up to the upper parts of the roof; he covered the interior with wood and laid the floor of the sacred dwelling with planks of fir wood.

(1 Kings 6:16) 
And he built twenty cubits from the back part of the Temple building with cedar planks, from the floor up to the top, and he made an inner sanctuary there, which is to say, the Holy of Holies.

(1 Kings 6:17) 
And the main hall of the Temple, in front of the inner oracle, was forty cubits long.

(1 Kings 6:18) 
And the entire interior of the sacred dwelling was covered with cedar planks, having carved mouldings and various projecting sculptures; there was absolutely nothing inside but cedar wood.

(1 Kings 6:19) 
And he prepared the inner oracle in the middle of the sacred dwelling, in its interior part, so that he might place there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.

(1 Kings 6:20) 
Furthermore, the inner oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height. He covered it with pure gold, and he fashioned an altar from cedar planks.

(1 Kings 6:21) 
And Solomon overlaid the sacred dwelling's interior with pure gold. He placed golden panels all around the sanctuary and prepared a golden veil.

(1 Kings 6:22) 
And he covered the entire altar of the inner oracle with pure gold; and he overlaid the whole sacred dwelling with gold until all was completed. Indeed, he also covered the altar of the oracle with gold.

(1 Kings 6:23) 
And in the inner oracle, he made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits in height.

(1 Kings 6:24) 
One wing of a cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits long; that is, it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.

(1 Kings 6:25) 
The second cherub was also ten cubits long. Both cherubim had the same measurement and the same workmanship.

(1 Kings 6:26) 
The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and similarly, the other cherub also had a height of ten cubits.

(1 Kings 6:27) 
And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple sanctuary. The cherubim spread out their wings, and one wing of a cherub touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their other two wings met each other in the middle of the Temple.

(1 Kings 6:28) 
And he also overlaid the cherubim with gold.

(1 Kings 6:29) 
And all the walls of the sacred dwelling, all around, he carved with various engravings and carvings, making cherubim, and palm trees, and he carved various pictures, as if projecting from the wall and extending beyond it.

(1 Kings 6:30) 
Moreover, he covered the floor of the sacred dwelling with gold, both inside and outside.

(1 Kings 6:31) 
And for the entrance to the inner oracle, he made doors of olive wood, with doorposts and doorframes forming five angles.

(1 Kings 6:32) 
And the two doors were made of olive wood. On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and greatly projecting images. He covered all of these with gold, overlaying both the cherubim and the palm trees with gold.

(1 Kings 6:33) 
And for the entrance to the main Temple hall, he made doorposts of olive wood, shaped squarely.

(1 Kings 6:34) 
And there were two doors of fir wood; each door was double, and they folded back upon each other.

(1 Kings 6:35) 
And he carved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and many carvings that seemed to project outward. And he covered all of these with gold.

(1 Kings 6:36) 
And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stones and one course of cedar timbers.

(1 Kings 6:37) 
In the fourth year, the foundation of the sacred dwelling for the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziph.

(1 Kings 6:38) 
And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month of the year), the sacred dwelling was finished in all its work and in all its construction. So Solomon built it in seven years.

(1 Kings 6:39) 
I did not enclose the entire sacred dwelling with the side structures' paneling.

(1 Kings 6:40) 
And the exterior of the sacred dwelling, and its interior, and the ceilings, and all the woodwork, were made of cedar wood.

(1 Kings 7:1) 
Now, Solomon built his own royal palace for thirteen years, until he completed all the buildings in his complex.

(1 Kings 7:2) 
He also built a palace known as 'the House of the Forest of Lebanon.' It was one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. This structure had four rows of cedar columns, supporting cedar beams for the ceiling above the columns.

(1 Kings 7:3) 
The colonnade was made of cedar columns, supporting thirty cedar beams above them. These beams were precisely fitted to the columns, and the capitals of the columns were adorned with carvings all around.

(1 Kings 7:4) 
There were dining hall windows arranged in three rows all around. Above these, there were additional sets of windows, also in three layers.

(1 Kings 7:5) 
All the doorways, windows, and doorframes were designed with square frames, each matching the other, arranged in three consistent rows.

(1 Kings 7:6) 
He also built a colonnade, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, formed by columns. There was a second portico in front of this larger one, complete with its own columns and supporting architraves placed upon them.

(1 Kings 7:7) 
He made a throne room for judgment, where he would sit to pass decrees, known as 'the Portico of Judgment.' This entire room, from the floor to the ceiling, was covered all around with cedar paneling.

(1 Kings 7:8) 
Solomon's own dwelling, where he lived, was constructed with a different design, set outside this judgment portico. It was similar in style to the House of the Forest of Lebanon. He also built a palace of the same craftsmanship for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.

(1 Kings 7:9) 
All these structures were built using expensive, precisely cut stones, sawn with a saw, both on their interior and exterior faces. These stones extended from the foundation up to the roof-level, and on the outside, they reached all the way to the great courtyard.

(1 Kings 7:10) 
The foundations themselves were laid with costly, large stones: some were eighteen cubits, and others were twelve cubits in size.

(1 Kings 7:11) 
Above these large foundation stones, there were more costly stones, precisely cut to measure, along with cedar timbers.

(1 Kings 7:12) 
The great courtyard all around was constructed with three rows of cut stones and one row of cedar wood. The inner courtyard of the Lord's Temple and the portico of the Temple were built similarly.

(1 Kings 7:13) 
So King Solomon sent for and brought Hiram from Tyre.

(1 Kings 7:14) 
Hiram was the son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naphtali, but his father was a man from Tyre, a skilled bronze-worker. Hiram possessed exceptional knowledge for executing every kind of bronze work. When he arrived before King Solomon, he carried out all the work entrusted to him.

(1 Kings 7:15) 
He cast two columns out of bronze. Each column was eighteen cubits in height, and the circumference of each column was twelve cubits, measured around it.

(1 Kings 7:16) 
He also made two bronze capitals, cast in a mold, to be placed on the tops of the columns. Each capital was five cubits high.

(1 Kings 7:17) 
On the capitals, which were on top of the columns, he crafted decorations resembling netting and intertwined chains. There were seven such ornate layers on one capital and seven layers on the other capital.

(1 Kings 7:18) 
He finished the columns, designing two rows of pomegranates all around on one capital, concealing them within the netting that was above the column tops. Similarly, one hundred pomegranates were arranged in two rows all around the other capital.

(1 Kings 7:19) 
The capitals on top of the columns, in the portico, were shaped like polished lilies, extending for four cubits.

(1 Kings 7:20) 
Again, there were other capitals on the two columns, extending around above the netting. Two hundred pomegranates were arranged in rows all around the second capital.

(1 Kings 7:21) 
He set up these columns in the portico of the Temple. He erected the right-hand column and named it 'Jachin.' In the same way, he erected the left-hand column and named it 'Boaz.'

(1 Kings 7:22) 
On top of the columns, there was a decorative design resembling lilies. This completed the work on the columns.

(1 Kings 7:23) 
He also made the great bronze basin, referred to as 'the Sea.' It measured ten cubits from rim to rim, perfectly round in its circumference. It was five cubits high, and a measuring line of thirty cubits could encircle its entire perimeter.

(1 Kings 7:24) 
Under its rim, there were sculpted decorations encircling it, ten sections per cubit, appearing as if two rows of carvings had been cast as one piece.

(1 Kings 7:25) 
The basin stood upon twelve bronze oxen. Three of them faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The great basin rested upon them from above, with the rear parts of the oxen facing inward.

(1 Kings 7:26) 
The thickness of the bronze basin was four fingers. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, or like a spreading lily petal. It had a capacity of two thousand baths.

(1 Kings 7:27) 
He also made ten bronze stands. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.

(1 Kings 7:28) 
Between the panels on the stands, there were sculpted figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim. Similar decorations were also placed on the sections above and below these figures.

(1 Kings 7:29) 
Beneath the feet of each stand were four wheels, and their axles were made of bronze. On all four sides, there were shoulder-like supports, cast in bronze, positioned opposite each other beneath the rim.

(1 Kings 7:30) 
The four sides of each stand were adorned with wave-like carvings and hand-like sculptures all around.

(1 Kings 7:31) 
The opening for the basin in the middle, at the top, was one cubit. All around the opening, there were engraved connections. The work was square, not round, measuring one and a half cubits in width.

(1 Kings 7:32) 
And there were four wheels on each side, positioned beneath the connecting structures. The height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.

(1 Kings 7:33) 
The wheels were similar to chariot wheels; their axles, spokes, felloes, and hubs, were all cast in bronze.

(1 Kings 7:34) 
There were four shoulder-like supports on each stand, extending downwards. They were cast in bronze and positioned opposite each other.

(1 Kings 7:35) 
At the very top of each stand, there was a round feature, one and a half cubits in circumference, with carvings on each small column and on its square panels.

(1 Kings 7:36) 
He carved lions, oxen, and cherubim onto the panels and square surfaces. On the hinges, there were also sculpted decorative additions.

(1 Kings 7:37) 
In this manner, he made ten stands. All of them had the same casting, the same measurements, and the same carvings.

(1 Kings 7:38) 
He also made ten bronze basins. Each basin had a capacity of forty baths, and each basin measured four cubits. One basin was placed upon each of the stands.

(1 Kings 7:39) 
He placed the ten stands, five on the right side of the Temple and five on the left. The great bronze basin, the Sea, he placed on the right side of the Temple, towards the southeast.

(1 Kings 7:40) 
Furthermore, Hiram made the pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed all the work for King Solomon in the House of the Lord.

(1 Kings 7:1) 
But Solomon built his own royal palace, a large complex, over the course of thirteen years, and he finally finished all the construction of it.

(1 Kings 7:2) 
He also built a palace structure known as 'the House of the Forest of Lebanon'—a massive building one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. It was supported by four rows of wooden columns, for all the timber was cedar.

(1 Kings 7:3) 
A cedar roof was built above this structure, extending over the porticos, supported by thirty-five columns. Each of these columns was perfectly aligned in its proper order.

(1 Kings 7:4) 
There was also a specific portico with thirty columns, and upon these columns rested heavy cedar beams.

(1 Kings 7:5) 
All the doors and windows, and every single doorpost, were perfectly square in their design, and each was spaced evenly and symmetrically.

(1 Kings 7:6) 
He then constructed a portico of columns fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Directly in front of it, he built another portico, also with timber and columns, and a vestibule leading to it.

(1 Kings 7:7) 
He also built the 'Portico of the Throne,' where he would sit to pronounce judgments, naming it the 'Portico of Judgment.' This entire space was paneled throughout with cedar wood, from the floor all the way up to the roof rafters.

(1 Kings 7:8) 
His personal residence, where he lived, was of a different architectural style, located beyond this portico, similar in construction to the House of the Forest of Lebanon. He also built a similar palace, with the same craftsmanship, for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.

(1 Kings 7:9) 
All these structures were built with expensive, sawed stone blocks, both inside and out, from the foundations all the way up to the roof; this extended outward to the great courtyard.

(1 Kings 7:10) 
The very foundations were made of precious, large stone blocks—some ten cubits long, and others eight cubits long.

(1 Kings 7:11) 
Above these foundation stones were more precious stones, precisely cut to measure, interspersed with cedar wood.

(1 Kings 7:12) 
The great courtyard surrounding these buildings had three courses of hewn stones, topped by one course of cedar beams. The inner courtyard of the Lord's Temple and the temple porch also followed this same construction pattern.

(1 Kings 7:13) 
So King Solomon sent for Hiram from Tyre.

(1 Kings 7:14) 
Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, but his father was a Tyrian, a skilled bronze worker. Hiram was filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge for all kinds of bronze work. When he arrived before King Solomon, he undertook and completed all the work assigned to him.

(1 Kings 7:15) 
He cast two columns out of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high. A circumference of twelve cubits encircled each of them.

(1 Kings 7:16) 
He also cast two capitals out of bronze, to be placed on top of the columns; each capital was five cubits high.

(1 Kings 7:17) 
Each capital for the columns was intricately adorned with bronze lattice-work, and chain-work wonderfully connected, and sculpted lily designs.

(1 Kings 7:18) 
He crafted two rows of pomegranates encircling each lattice-work, designed to cover the capitals that were on the top of the columns. He did the same for the second capital.

(1 Kings 7:19) 
The capitals that were placed on the tops of the columns were shaped like lilies, a work of art, measuring four cubits high in the portico area.

(1 Kings 7:20) 
There were additional capitals above each column, around the lattice-work, with two hundred pomegranates arranged in two rows all around. He made the second capital in the very same manner.

(1 Kings 7:21) 
Then he erected the columns in the portico of the Temple. When he had set up the right-hand column, he named it Jachin. Likewise, when he set up the left-hand column, he named it Boaz.

(1 Kings 7:22) 
The tops of the columns were adorned with capitals shaped like lilies. With this, the work of the columns was completed.

(1 Kings 7:23) 
He also cast a large bronze basin, which was called 'the Sea.' It measured ten cubits from rim to rim, perfectly round in its circumference, and five cubits in height. A measuring cord of thirty cubits could encompass its entire circumference.

(1 Kings 7:24) 
Below its rim, all around the circumference, there were decorations resembling gourds, and other various sculptures, carved in bronze. There were two rows of these cast decorations, extending ten cubits around the entire basin.

(1 Kings 7:25) 
This great basin stood upon twelve bronze oxen. Three of these oxen faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The basin itself rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were turned inward, hidden beneath the basin.

(1 Kings 7:26) 
The thickness of the basin's bronze wall was three fingers wide. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup or a blossoming lily petal. It was capable of holding two thousand baths of water.

(1 Kings 7:27) 
He then constructed ten bronze stands for the washing basins, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.

(1 Kings 7:28) 
The structure of these stands was intricately paneled with engraved designs, and between the joints were panels depicting various figures.

(1 Kings 7:29) 
On the panels, between the upper and lower borders, were sculpted lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below these joints, near the base, and beneath the lions and oxen, were more cast bronze figures, hanging like decorative armor plates.

(1 Kings 7:30) 
Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. There were also extensions like arms cast beneath the four corners of each stand, designed to support the washing basin. These extensions were cast as a single piece with the stands, facing each other in pairs.

(1 Kings 7:31) 
The opening for the washing basin, on the top, extended one cubit inward. Around this opening, another cubit was decorated with carvings and figures. All these parts were square, not round, around their circumference.

(1 Kings 7:32) 
Furthermore, there were four wheels at the lower part of the stands, and their axles were part of the stands themselves. The height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.

(1 Kings 7:33) 
The wheel assembly was like that of a chariot, and all parts, individually, were made of cast bronze.

(1 Kings 7:34) 
And at each of the four corners of every stand, there were four shoulder-like projections, cast as part of the base itself.

(1 Kings 7:35) 
At the very top of each stand, there was a round platform, six cubits in circumference, with interwoven designs and sculptures, all cast as part of the stand.

(1 Kings 7:36) 
On the panels of the stands and on their joints, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, depicting them in high relief. Around the edges, he added decorative borders.

(1 Kings 7:37) 
In this manner, he made all ten stands; they were all of the same casting, the same measurements, and the same sculpted designs.

(1 Kings 7:38) 
He also made ten bronze washing basins, each holding forty baths of water. Each basin was four cubits high and was designed to sit on one of the ten stands.

(1 Kings 7:39) 
He placed five of the stands on the right side of the Temple and five on the left side. The great bronze basin, 'the Sea,' he placed on the right side of the Temple, facing eastward, towards the south.

(1 Kings 7:40) 
So Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. He thus completed all the work for King Solomon concerning the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:1) 
Then Solomon gathered all the chief men of Israel, and all the leaders of the tribes, and the heads of the family lines of the sons of Israel to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David—also known as Zion.

(1 Kings 8:2) 
All the men of Israel gathered together to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, for the Feast—which is the seventh month.

(1 Kings 8:3) 
All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.

(1 Kings 8:4) 
and the Tent of Meeting—and all the sacred vessels that were kept in the Tent. The priests and Levites carried these items.

(1 Kings 8:5) 
King Solomon and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, in the presence of the Ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen without number or estimation, because there were so many.

(1 Kings 8:6) 
Then the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its proper place, into the innermost sanctuary of the Temple, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.

(1 Kings 8:7) 
Indeed, the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark, protecting the Ark and its carrying poles from above.

(1 Kings 8:8) 
When the carrying poles were extended, their ends were visible outside the innermost sanctuary, in front of the entrance to the Holy of Holies, but they were not visible from outside the sanctuary itself. They have remained there until the present day.

(1 Kings 8:9) 
There was nothing in the Ark except for the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel after they had come out of the land of Egypt.

(1 Kings 8:10) 
Now it happened that when the priests came out of the Sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:11) 
The priests could not stand there and minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:12) 
Then Solomon said: “The Lord said He would dwell in the cloud.

(1 Kings 8:13) 
Building, I have built a house as Your dwelling place—a very firm throne for You forever.”

(1 Kings 8:14) 
The king then turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel, for the whole assembly of Israel was standing.

(1 Kings 8:15) 
And he said: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to my father David, and has fulfilled with His own hands what He said, saying:

(1 Kings 8:16) 
‘From the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel where a house might be built for My name to be there. But I chose David to be over My people Israel.’

(1 Kings 8:17) 
My father David desired to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.

(1 Kings 8:18) 
But the Lord said to my father David: ‘Because you desired in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in having this very thought in your mind.

(1 Kings 8:19) 
Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who will come forth from your body—he shall build the house for My name.’

(1 Kings 8:20) 
The Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke. For I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised. And I have built a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.

(1 Kings 8:21) 
And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, which contains the Covenant of the Lord that He made with our fathers when they came out of the land of Egypt.”

(1 Kings 8:22) 
So Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands toward the created universe.

(1 Kings 8:23) 
And he said: “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, in the created universe above or on the earth below. You keep Your covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.

(1 Kings 8:24) 
You have kept what You promised to Your servant, my father David. You spoke with Your mouth, and You have fulfilled with Your hands, as this present day proves.

(1 Kings 8:25) 
Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant my father David what You promised him, saying: ‘There shall not fail you a man from My sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, provided that your sons keep their way, to walk before Me as you have walked.’

(1 Kings 8:26) 
And now, O God of Israel, may Your words which You spoke to Your servant, my father David, be confirmed.

(1 Kings 8:27) 
Can it be truly believed that God would actually dwell on earth? If the created universe and even the highest created heavens cannot contain You, how much less can this temple I have built?

(1 Kings 8:28) 
Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, O Lord my God. Hear the hymn and the prayer that Your servant prays before You today.

(1 Kings 8:29) 
May Your eyes be open toward this house night and day—this house of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there’—so that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays to You in this place.

(1 Kings 8:30) 
Hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whoever prays in this place. Hear in the created universe, in Your dwelling place. And when You hear, be merciful.

(1 Kings 8:31) 
If a man sins against his neighbor, and he is bound by an oath to testify, and he comes to Your altar in this house to swear the oath,

(1 Kings 8:32) 
then hear from the created universe, and act, and judge Your servants. Condemn the wicked, repaying his actions upon his own head, and justify the righteous, returning to him according to his righteousness.

(1 Kings 8:33) 
If Your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against You, yet they return to You in repentance, confess Your name, and come and pray and make supplication to You in this house,

(1 Kings 8:34) 
then hear from the created universe, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.

(1 Kings 8:35) 
If the created universe is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, yet they pray in repentance in this place, and confess Your name, and turn from their sins because You have afflicted them,

(1 Kings 8:36) 
then hear in the created universe, and forgive the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and show them the good way in which they should walk. Then send rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.

(1 Kings 8:37) 
If there is famine in the land, or plague, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, or any other affliction, any sickness,

(1 Kings 8:38) 
then any supplication or prayer that is made by any person among Your people Israel, each recognizing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this house,

(1 Kings 8:39) 
then hear in the created universe, from Your most firm throne, and be merciful. Act to render to each person according to all his ways, as You know his heart—for You alone know the heart of all the sons of men.

(1 Kings 8:40) 
May they fear You all the days they live upon the face of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.

(1 Kings 8:1) 
Then King Solomon gathered all the elders of Israel. He also gathered all the tribal leaders and the heads of the families of the sons of Israel. They all came to King Solomon in Jerusalem. This assembly was to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.

(1 Kings 8:2) 
And all the men of Israel gathered to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month of the year.

(1 Kings 8:3) 
All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.

(1 Kings 8:4) 
And they brought up the Ark of the Lord, and the Tent of Meeting (also known as the Tabernacle of Testimony), and all the vessels of the Sanctuary that were in the Tabernacle. The priests and the Levites carried them.

(1 Kings 8:5) 
King Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, sacrificed sheep and oxen before the Ark. There were so many sacrificial animals that they could not be numbered, so vast was the multitude of these offerings.

(1 Kings 8:6) 
And the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its proper place. This was into the inner sanctuary of the house, the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.

(1 Kings 8:7) 
Indeed, the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the Ark. They covered the Ark and its carrying poles from above.

(1 Kings 8:8) 
The poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not visible from outside. They remained there even until the present day.

(1 Kings 8:9) 
There was nothing in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb. This was when the Lord made a covenant with the sons of Israel after they had come out of the land of Egypt.

(1 Kings 8:10) 
Now it happened, when the priests came out of the Sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:11) 
And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud. This was because the glory of the Lord, the visible manifestation of God's presence and power, had filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:12) 
Then Solomon said, 'The Lord said that He would dwell in a cloud.'

(1 Kings 8:13) 
I have indeed built a house as a dwelling place for You, a most firm and eternal place for Your glorious presence.

(1 Kings 8:14) 
And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. For all the assembly of Israel was standing.

(1 Kings 8:15) 
And he said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel. He spoke with His own mouth to David my father, and by His works, He has brought it to pass, saying:'

(1 Kings 8:16) 
'From the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel for a house to be built in My name there. But I chose David to be over My people Israel.'

(1 Kings 8:17) 
'And it was the intention of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.'

(1 Kings 8:18) 
'The Lord said to David my father: Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in conceiving this very thing in your mind.'

(1 Kings 8:19) 
'Nevertheless, you shall not build the house. But your son, who will come out from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.'

(1 Kings 8:20) 
'The Lord has established His word which He spoke. For I have risen up in place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised. And I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.'

(1 Kings 8:21) 
'And there I have established a place for the Ark, in which is the Covenant of the Lord. This is the Covenant He made with our fathers when they came out of the land of Egypt.'

(1 Kings 8:22) 
Therefore, Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands towards heaven, the dwelling place of God.

(1 Kings 8:23) 
And he said, 'O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, above in heaven or below on earth. You keep covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.'

(1 Kings 8:24) 
'You have kept what You promised to Your servant David my father. And You have fulfilled Your words, as is proven this very day.'

(1 Kings 8:25) 
'Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You spoke, saying: There shall not fail you a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel. Nevertheless, this is true if your sons will keep their way, and walk before Me as you have walked.'

(1 Kings 8:26) 
'And now, O Lord, God of Israel, let Your words be confirmed, these words You spoke to David my father, Your servant.'

(1 Kings 8:27) 
'But will God indeed dwell on the earth? For if the universe, and even the heaven of heavens, cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built?'

(1 Kings 8:28) 
'Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord my God. Hear the hymn and the prayer which Your servant prays before You today.'

(1 Kings 8:29) 
'That Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day. Toward the house of which You said, My Name shall be there, meaning My presence and authority will reside there.'

(1 Kings 8:30) 
'That You may hear the prayer of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whenever anyone prays in this place. And You shall hear them in the place of Your dwelling, in heaven. And when You hear, You will be merciful.'

(1 Kings 8:31) 
'If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid upon him because of it, and he comes to swear before Your altar in this house:'

(1 Kings 8:32) 
'Then You, in heaven, will hear and act and judge Your servants. You will condemn the wicked and bring his way upon his own head, and You will justify the righteous, rendering to him according to his righteousness.'

(1 Kings 8:33) 
'If Your people Israel are defeated by their enemies (because they have sinned against You), and they turn back, perform penance, supplicate You in this house, and confess Your name, acknowledging Your power and authority:'

(1 Kings 8:34) 
'Then You will hear in heaven, and will be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and You will bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.'

(1 Kings 8:35) 
'If the sky is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, and they pray in this place, and perform penance to Your name, and they turn from their sins because of their afflictions:'

(1 Kings 8:36) 
'Then hear You in heaven, and be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel. And teach them the good way in which they should walk. And give rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.'

(1 Kings 8:37) 
'If there is famine in the land, or pestilence, or mildew, or blight, or locusts, or caterpillars, and if their enemy besieges them in the gates of their cities, whatever plague, whatever wound they suffer:'

(1 Kings 8:38) 
'Whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by any man, or by all Your people Israel, each one knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this house:'

(1 Kings 8:39) 
'Then You will hear in heaven, in the place of Your dwelling, and will be merciful, and will act. And You will render to each one according to all his ways, as You see his heart. For You alone know the heart of all the sons of men.'

(1 Kings 8:40) 
'So that they may fear You all the days that they live upon the surface of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.'

(1 Kings 8:1) 
Then King Solomon gathered together all the elders of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, and all the heads of the households of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, so that they might bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion, the fortress part of Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 8:2) 
And all of Israel gathered to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, on the seventh festival period. This is the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar.

(1 Kings 8:3) 
And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.

(1 Kings 8:4) 
And the priests and the Levites brought the Ark of the Lord, and the tent of the Covenant, and all the sacred vessels that were in the tent.

(1 Kings 8:5) 
King Solomon and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, in the presence of the Ark, sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted.

(1 Kings 8:6) 
And the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.

(1 Kings 8:7) 
For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the Ark, and protected the Ark and its carrying poles from above.

(1 Kings 8:8) 
And the Ark remained there until this present day.

(1 Kings 8:9) 
There was nothing else in the Ark except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there in Horeb, when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

(1 Kings 8:10) 
And it came to pass that when the priests came out of the sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:11) 
And the priests were not able to stand and minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.

(1 Kings 8:12) 
Then Solomon said: 'The Lord said that He would dwell in deep darkness, which He manifests in a cloud.'

(1 Kings 8:13) 
Building, I have built a house as a dwelling place for You, and Your firm throne for all eternity.

(1 Kings 8:14) 
And the king turned his face and blessed all the assembly of Israel, for all the assembly of Israel was standing.

(1 Kings 8:15) 
And he said: 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to David my father, and with His own hands, He has fulfilled what He promised, saying: '

(1 Kings 8:16) 
'From the day when I led My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel, so that a house might be built there for My Name; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.'

(1 Kings 8:17) 
'And David my father desired to build a house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel;'

(1 Kings 8:18) 
'But the Lord said to David my father: "Because you desired to build a house for My Name, you have done well in this very thing;"'

(1 Kings 8:19) 
'Nevertheless, you will not build the house, but your son, who will come forth from your body, he himself will build the house for My Name."'

(1 Kings 8:20) 
The Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke, for I have risen in place of David my father, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord spoke. And I have built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.

(1 Kings 8:21) 
And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord which He made with our fathers, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

(1 Kings 8:22) 
Therefore, Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands towards the sky.

(1 Kings 8:23) 
And he said: 'Lord God of Israel, there is no God like You, neither in the sky above, nor on the earth below. You keep covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.'

(1 Kings 8:24) 
'You who have kept for Your servant David my father what You spoke to him; You spoke with Your mouth, and with Your own hands You have fulfilled it, just as it is this very day.'

(1 Kings 8:25) 
'Now therefore, Lord God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You spoke to him, saying: "There shall not fail you a man from the throne of Israel." Only if your sons will guard their way and walk before Me as you yourself have walked.'

(1 Kings 8:26) 
'And now, Lord God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You spoke to Your servant David my father.'

(1 Kings 8:27) 
'But truly, if God can dwell on the earth— the sky and the highest heavens cannot contain You, much less this house which I have built!'

(1 Kings 8:28) 
'Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and upon his supplications, O Lord my God! Hear the cry and the prayer with which Your servant prays before You today;'

(1 Kings 8:29) 
'So that Your eyes may be open toward this house, night and day— toward the house of which You said: "My Name shall be there"— so that You may hear the supplication which Your servant prays to You in this place.'

(1 Kings 8:30) 
'So that You may hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whatever they pray in this place. And You will hear in the place of Your dwelling in the universe— the uncreated realm beyond the created sky— and when You have heard, You will be merciful.'

(1 Kings 8:31) 
'If a man has sinned against his neighbor, and he has taken an oath to swear, and one comes before Your altar in this house and confesses to You;'

(1 Kings 8:32) 
'You will hear in the universe beyond created things, and You will act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked, and returning his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, and repaying him according to his righteousness.'

(1 Kings 8:33) 
'If Your people Israel flee before their enemies (because they will have sinned against You), and they turn and do penance, and they pray to You in this house, confessing Your Name;'

(1 Kings 8:34) 
'You will hear in the uncreated universe, and You will be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and You will bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.'

(1 Kings 8:35) 
'If the sky is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, and they pray in this place and do penance to Your Name, and they turn from their sins because of their affliction;'

(1 Kings 8:36) 
'You will hear in the uncreated universe, and You will be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and You will show them the good way in which they should walk, and You will give rain upon Your land, which You gave to Your people as a possession.'

(1 Kings 8:37) 
'If there is famine in the land, or plague, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or rust, and if an enemy besieges them in their cities' gates— any plague, any sickness;'

(1 Kings 8:38) 
'Whatever supplication, whatever prayer is made by any man, or by all of Your people Israel, when each one acknowledges the wound of his own heart, and spreads out his hands in this house;'

(1 Kings 8:39) 
'You will hear in the uncreated universe, from Your firm throne, and You will be merciful and You will act. And You will repay each one according to all his ways, just as You alone see his heart, You who know the hearts of all the sons of men;'

(1 Kings 8:40) 
'So that they may fear You all the days that they live upon the face of the earth which You gave to our fathers.'

(1 Kings 9:1) 
It came to pass after Solomon had finished building the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace. He had completed everything he desired and had wanted to do.

(1 Kings 9:2) 
The Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, just as He had appeared to him in Gibeon before.

(1 Kings 9:3) 
And the Lord said to him: "I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you presented before Me. I have consecrated this Temple that you have built so that I may establish My presence there for all time. My divine attention and My love will be there always.

(1 Kings 9:4) 
As for you, if you will walk before Me with sincerity of heart and in uprightness, just as your father David walked, and if you will do everything that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My judgments,

(1 Kings 9:5) 
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David when I said: 'A man from your lineage shall not be cut off from the throne of Israel.'

(1 Kings 9:6) 
But if you and your sons turn away from Me, not keeping My commandments and My ceremonies which I have set before you, but instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them,

(1 Kings 9:7) 
then I will cast Israel from the face of the land which I have given them. And this Temple, which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. Then Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

(1 Kings 9:8) 
And this house will become an example of desolation. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss in dismay, saying: 'Why has the Lord done such things to this land and to this Temple?'

(1 Kings 9:9) 
And they will respond: 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers out of the land of Egypt. And they followed foreign gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore, the Lord has brought all this evil upon them.'

(1 Kings 9:10) 
Now it came to pass after twenty years, during which Solomon had built the two houses: that is, the Lord's Temple and the royal palace.

(1 Kings 9:11) 
So King Hiram of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar wood, fir wood, and gold, according to all his desire.

(1 Kings 9:12) 
In return, Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

(1 Kings 9:13) 
When Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, they did not please him at all.

(1 Kings 9:14) 
And he said: "What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?" And he called them the land of Cabul—meaning 'worthless land'—a name it kept until this very day.

(1 Kings 9:15) 
This is the summary of the tribute which King Solomon imposed for building the Lord's Temple, and his own royal palace, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

(1 Kings 9:16) 
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire. He killed the Canaanites who lived in the city. Then he gave it as a dowry to his daughter, who became Solomon's wife.

(1 Kings 9:17) 
So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth Horon.

(1 Kings 9:18) 
He also rebuilt Baalath and Tamar, which was in the desert wilderness.

(1 Kings 9:19) 
And he built all the store-cities that belonged to Solomon, along with the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen. He also built everything else that pleased him to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land under his dominion.

(1 Kings 9:20) 
All the people who were left of the Amorites, and Hittites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites—these were the peoples who were not of the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 9:21) 
Their children, who were left in the land and whom the children of Israel had not been able to utterly destroy, Solomon forced their descendants to be his bondservants and laborers, a practice that continued until this day.

(1 Kings 9:22) 
However, Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel to be bondservants. Instead, they served as warriors, his personal attendants, his princes, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and horsemen.

(1 Kings 9:23) 
These were the chief officers over Solomon's work: five hundred and fifty men who presided over the people and those who performed the labor.

(1 Kings 9:24) 
But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. It was then that he built Millo.

(1 Kings 9:25) 
Solomon also offered burnt offerings and peace offerings three times each year upon the altar which he had built for the Lord. And he also burned incense upon the incense altar which he had dedicated to the Lord. Thus, the construction of the Temple was completed.

(1 Kings 9:26) 
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Elath, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.

(1 Kings 9:27) 
And King Hiram of Tyre sent his ships with the fleet, and his servants who were experienced sailors and mariners who knew the sea, along with Solomon's servants.

(1 Kings 9:28) 
When they had come to Ophir, they obtained from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought it back to King Solomon.

(1 Kings 9:29) 
Now the Queen of Sheba, having heard of the fame of Solomon and his relationship with the Lord, came to test him with difficult riddles.

(1 Kings 9:30) 
And she entered Jerusalem with a great company and with camels bearing spices, and a very large amount of gold, and precious stones. She came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was in her heart.

(1 Kings 9:31) 
And Solomon answered all the questions she proposed. There was no word hidden from the king that he could not answer for her.

(1 Kings 9:32) 
But when the Queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,

(1 Kings 9:33) 
and the food on his table, and the dwellings of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he offered in the house of the Lord, she was utterly overwhelmed and breathless.

(1 Kings 9:34) 
And she said to the king: "The report which I heard in my own land about your deeds and about your wisdom is true.

(1 Kings 9:35) 
And I did not believe those who told me until I myself came and saw with my own eyes. Now I have proved that not even half had been told to me. Your wisdom and your works are far greater than the report I heard."

(1 Kings 9:36) 
"Blessed are your men, and blessed are these servants of yours, who stand before you always and hear your wisdom.

(1 Kings 9:37) 
Blessed be the Lord your God, with whom you were pleased, and who set you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord loved Israel and desired that there be a king, and that you should render judgment and justice."

(1 Kings 9:38) 
So she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very large amount of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought as those which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

(1 Kings 9:39) 
Moreover, Hiram's fleet of ships, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir an enormous amount of almug wood—also known as algum or thyine wood—along with many precious stones.

(1 Kings 9:40) 
And from the almug wood, the king made supports for the house of the Lord and for the royal house, and lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has been brought or seen until this present day.

(1 Kings 9:1) 
Now it came to pass when Solomon had completed the construction of the Lord's Temple and the king's palace, and everything else he had desired and wished for,

(1 Kings 9:2) 
the Lord appeared to him a second time, just as He had appeared to him previously in Gabaon.

(1 Kings 9:3) 
And the Lord said to him: "I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you prayed before Me. I have sanctified this Temple which you have built, so that My Name may be placed there forever. My eyes and My heart will be there for all time."

(1 Kings 9:4) 
"You, too, if you walk before Me, just as your father David walked with integrity of heart and in righteousness, and if you do everything I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My ordinances,

(1 Kings 9:5) 
I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying: 'There shall not fail a man of your line to sit on the throne of Israel.'"

(1 Kings 9:6) 
"But if you, or your children, turn away from Me, and do not keep My commandments and My ceremonies, which I have set before you, but instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them,

(1 Kings 9:7) 
then I will cut off Israel from the face of the earth which I have given to them. And this Temple, which I have sanctified for My Name, I will cast away from My presence. Israel will then become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

(1 Kings 9:8) 
This Temple, even in its ruin, will serve as a warning. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss in dismay, saying: 'Why has the Lord done this to this land and to this Temple?'

(1 Kings 9:9) 
And they will answer: 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they followed foreign gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore, the Lord has brought all this evil upon them.'"

(1 Kings 9:10) 
Now, at the end of twenty years, after Solomon had built the two structures — that is, the Lord's Temple and the king's palace —

(1 Kings 9:11) 
(Hiram, king of Tyre, had supplied Solomon with cedar, pine wood, and gold, according to all that he needed.) Then Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

(1 Kings 9:12) 
But when Hiram came from Tyre to inspect the cities which Solomon had given him, they displeased him.

(1 Kings 9:13) 
So he said: "What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?" And he called that land 'Cabul' — which means 'good for nothing' — even to this present day.

(1 Kings 9:14) 
Moreover, Hiram had sent Solomon one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

(1 Kings 9:15) 
This is an account of the levy King Solomon raised to build the Lord's Temple, his own palace, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.

(1 Kings 9:16) 
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer, and burned it with fire. He had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and then he gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.

(1 Kings 9:17) 
So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, and Lower Beth Horon,

(1 Kings 9:18) 
and Baalath, and Tamar (Palmyra) in the desert land.

(1 Kings 9:19) 
He also built all the storage cities that were around these cities, as well as the chariot cities, and the cavalry cities. He built everything that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his kingdom.

(1 Kings 9:20) 
All the people who remained of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites — who were not of the children of Israel —

(1 Kings 9:21) 
their descendants who remained in the land after them, whom the children of Israel could not completely destroy — these Solomon made subject to forced labor, a tribute, even to this present day.

(1 Kings 9:22) 
But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel his forced laborers. Instead, they were his warriors, his servants, his officials, his commanders, and the officers over his chariots and his cavalry.

(1 Kings 9:23) 
These were the chief officers overseeing Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty in number, who ruled over the people and over those who performed the work.

(1 Kings 9:24) 
But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the City of David to her own palace, which Solomon had built for her. It was after this that Solomon built the Millo.

(1 Kings 9:25) 
Also, three times each year, Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar that he had built for the Lord. He burned incense there before the Lord. And so, the Temple was completed with its regular sacrifices.

(1 Kings 9:26) 
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Elath, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.

(1 Kings 9:27) 
And Hiram sent his own experienced sailors, men skilled in the sea, to be on the fleet with Solomon's servants.

(1 Kings 9:28) 
When they arrived in Ophir, they brought back gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and presented it to King Solomon.

(1 Kings 9:29) 
At that time, the Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, specifically regarding his wisdom from the Lord, and she came to test him with difficult questions and riddles.

(1 Kings 9:30) 
She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with riches, and with camels carrying spices, an immense amount of gold, and precious gems. When she came to King Solomon, she spoke with him about everything that was on her mind and in her heart.

(1 Kings 9:31) 
And Solomon answered all the questions she put to him. There was no matter hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.

(1 Kings 9:32) 
When the Queen of Sheba saw all of Solomon's wisdom, and the palace that he had built,

(1 Kings 9:33) 
and the food on his table, and the residences of his servants, and the organization of his attendants, and their uniforms, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he offered in the Lord's Temple, she was completely overwhelmed; she was left breathless.

(1 Kings 9:34) 
And she said to the king: "The report that I heard in my own land concerning your words and your wisdom is truly accurate.

(1 Kings 9:35) 
I did not believe those who told me, until I myself came and saw with my own eyes. And I have confirmed that even half of it had not been reported to me. Your wisdom and your achievements are greater than the rumor I heard.

(1 Kings 9:36) 
Blessed are your men, and blessed are your servants, who always stand before you and hear your wisdom.

(1 Kings 9:37) 
Blessed be the Lord your God, in whom you found favor, who has placed you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord loved Israel and desired to save them forever. And for that reason, He has made you king over them, so that you may execute justice and righteousness.

(1 Kings 9:38) 
Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and an extremely large quantity of spices, and precious gems. Never again was such a vast quantity of spices brought in as the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

(1 Kings 9:39) 
King Solomon, for his part, gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and asked of him, in addition to what he had already given her freely.

(1 Kings 9:40) 
Then she returned and went back to her own land, along with her servants.

(1 Kings 10:1) 
The Queen of Sheba, having heard of Solomon's great fame and the wisdom he displayed in all his works for the Lord, came to Jerusalem to test him with intricate riddles.

(1 Kings 10:2) 
She arrived in Jerusalem with a large company of attendants and camels, laden with fragrant spices, a truly immense quantity of gold, and many precious jewels. When she met King Solomon, she spoke to him everything that was in her mind and heart.

(1 Kings 10:3) 
King Solomon then answered all the difficult questions she had proposed to him; there was no word or concept hidden from the King that he could not explain.

(1 Kings 10:4) 
So the Queen of Sheba saw for herself all of Solomon's wisdom, and she beheld the splendid royal palace he had built,

(1 Kings 10:5) 
and the lavish food upon his table, and the well-ordered arrangement of his servants' dwellings, and the orderly service of his ministers, and their fine apparel, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he regularly presented in the house of the Lord. She was utterly overwhelmed and left breathless by it all.

(1 Kings 10:6) 
She then said to the King: “The report I heard in my own land concerning your great sayings and your profound wisdom is true.

(1 Kings 10:7) 
I did not believe those who told me, until I myself came here and saw it with my own eyes. I can now confirm that not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and your accomplishments are far greater than the grand report I heard.”

(1 Kings 10:8) 
“Blessed are your own men, and truly blessed are these servants of yours, who constantly stand before you and hear your profound wisdom.

(1 Kings 10:9) 
May the Lord your God be blessed, in whom you have found favor and who has placed you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord has loved Israel eternally, and He has established you as king, so that you might execute true judgment and administer perfect justice.”

(1 Kings 10:10) 
Then she presented the King with one hundred twenty talents of gold, an exceedingly great quantity of aromatic spices, and many precious gems. There were never again brought such an abundance of spices as the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

(1 Kings 10:11) 
Furthermore, Hiram's fleet of ships, which regularly brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir an exceedingly large quantity of very rare almug wood, and many precious gems.

(1 Kings 10:12) 
From this almug wood, the King fashioned supports for the Temple of the Lord and for the royal palace. He also had lyres and harps made for the singers. No such almug wood has ever been brought or seen in Israel until this present day.

(1 Kings 10:13) 
Thus, King Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and requested from him, in addition to the royal gifts which he had generously offered her. After this, she returned and journeyed back to her own land with her servants.

(1 Kings 10:14) 
Now the weight of the gold that was brought to King Solomon each year amounted to six hundred sixty-six talents of pure gold,

(1 Kings 10:15) 
this was besides what was regularly brought to him by the tax-collectors, and by the traders, and by all the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia, and from all the governors of the lands.

(1 Kings 10:16) 
King Solomon also made two hundred large shields of refined pure gold; six hundred shekels of gold were used for the plating of each individual shield.

(1 Kings 10:17) 
And he made three hundred smaller shields of beaten, refined gold; three minas of gold covered each individual shield. The King placed these shields in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, a royal armory.

(1 Kings 10:18) 
The King also constructed a great royal throne made of ivory, which he overlaid with an exceedingly brilliant, gleaming gold.

(1 Kings 10:19) 
There were six steps leading up to the throne, and the back of the throne was rounded at the top. On either side, two arms supported the seat, and two carved lions stood beside these arms.

(1 Kings 10:20) 
And twelve smaller carved lions stood upon the six steps, six on each side. No such masterful work had ever been made in all the kingdoms of the earth.

(1 Kings 10:21) 
Furthermore, all of King Solomon's drinking vessels were made of solid gold, and all the furnishings of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of the purest gold. Silver was not considered valuable at all, nor was it esteemed as anything of worth in the days of Solomon.

(1 Kings 10:22) 
For the King's fleet of ships, sailing the sea together with Hiram's fleet, went to Tarshish once every three years. From there, they brought back gold, and silver, and ivory tusks, and apes, and peacocks.

(1 Kings 10:23) 
Thus, King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in both his immense wealth and his profound wisdom.

(1 Kings 10:24) 
And the entire world desired to behold Solomon, so that they might hear the extraordinary wisdom which God had placed in his heart.

(1 Kings 10:25) 
And each person brought him gifts, vessels of silver and of gold, fine garments, and weapons, and aromatic spices, horses, and mules, year after year without fail.

(1 Kings 10:26) 
Solomon also amassed chariots and cavalry; he acquired fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He stationed them in garrison cities designated for chariots and also kept some with the King in Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 10:27) 
The King caused silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as ordinary stones. And he made cedar wood as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in the lowlands.

(1 Kings 10:28) 
The horses for Solomon were brought out of Egypt and from Coa. The King's merchants bought them from Coa at a fixed price, and then transported them.

(1 Kings 10:29) 
A four-wheeled chariot was valued at six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse at one hundred fifty shekels. By this same arrangement, horses and chariots were sold to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria through Solomon's intermediaries.

(1 Kings 11:1) 
King Solomon, however, began to fall deeply in love with many foreign women—women who did not worship the true God. These included the daughter of Pharaoh, and women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittite lands.

(1 Kings 11:2) 
These were women from the nations about whom the Lord had strictly commanded the children of Israel: 'You must not go among them, and they must not come among you, for they will most certainly turn your hearts away to follow their false gods.' Despite this divine warning, Solomon became joined to these women because of his intense love for them.

(1 Kings 11:3) 
Solomon had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines, for a total of one thousand women. These women then turned his heart away from his true devotion to God.

(1 Kings 11:4) 
Indeed, when he was already an old man, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he began to follow their foreign gods. His devotion to the Lord his God was not complete, as was the devotion of David his father.

(1 Kings 11:5) 
Instead, Solomon worshipped Ashtart, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch, the detestable idol of the Ammonites.

(1 Kings 11:6) 
Solomon thus did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and he did not fully commit to following the Lord, as David his father had done.

(1 Kings 11:7) 
It was then that Solomon built a high place, a temple, for Chemosh, the detestable idol of the Moabites, on the hill that faces Jerusalem. He also built one for Moloch, the detestable idol of the children of Ammon.

(1 Kings 11:8) 
He built these places of idolatry for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their false gods.

(1 Kings 11:9) 
Therefore, the Lord's wrath was kindled against Solomon, because his devotion had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel. This was the same God who had appeared to him twice before—

(1 Kings 11:10) 
—and had specifically commanded him regarding this very thing: not to follow foreign gods. But Solomon did not keep what the Lord had commanded him.

(1 Kings 11:11) 
So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My commandments which I entrusted to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to one of your servants.'

(1 Kings 11:12) 
'However, I will not do this during your lifetime, out of respect for David your father. Instead, I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'

(1 Kings 11:13) 
'Yet, I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will leave one tribe for your son, for the sake of David My servant, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.'

(1 Kings 11:14) 
So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, a descendant of the royal lineage of Edom.

(1 Kings 11:15) 
This occurred when David was in Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army, had gone up to bury those slain in battle, and had struck down every male in Edom.

(1 Kings 11:16) 
Joab had remained in Edom for six months until he had completely eliminated every male there.

(1 Kings 11:17) 
Hadad himself, along with some Edomite men who had been servants of his father, fled with him to enter Egypt. At that time, Hadad was still a very young boy.

(1 Kings 11:18) 
When they set out from Midian, they came to Paran, and took men from Paran with them. They then entered Egypt, going to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with food, and assigned him land.

(1 Kings 11:19) 
Hadad found such great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, that Pharaoh even gave him his own sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as a wife.

(1 Kings 11:20) 
The sister of Queen Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh's own palace, and Genubath grew up there among Pharaoh's own sons.

(1 Kings 11:21) 
When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had died and was resting with his ancestors, and that Joab, the commander of the army, was also dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: 'Allow me to leave, so that I may return to my own land.'

(1 Kings 11:22) 
Pharaoh asked him, 'What do you lack here with me, that you seek to return to your own land?' Hadad replied, 'Nothing at all, but only let me go.'

(1 Kings 11:23) 
God also raised up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.

(1 Kings 11:24) 
Rezon had gathered men around himself and became the leader of a raiding band. This occurred when David was defeating those from Zobah. Rezon and his men went to Damascus, settled there, and began to rule in Damascus.

(1 Kings 11:25) 
Rezon became an adversary to Israel throughout all the days of Solomon's reign. This was in addition to the harm caused by Hadad, and Rezon's intense hatred against Israel. He reigned over Syria.

(1 Kings 11:26) 
Jeroboam also, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite from Zeredah, who was a servant of Solomon (and whose mother was a widow named Zeruah), raised his hand against the king.

(1 Kings 11:27) 
This was the reason for his rebellion: Solomon had built the Millo fortress and had closed up the breach in the City of David, his father.

(1 Kings 11:28) 
Jeroboam was a strong and capable man. When Solomon saw that the young man was diligently prepared for work, he put him in charge of all the forced labor from the house of Joseph.

(1 Kings 11:29) 
It happened at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak. It happened that there were only the two of them in the field.

(1 Kings 11:30) 
Ahijah then took hold of his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.

(1 Kings 11:31) 
And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom away from the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes.'

(1 Kings 11:32) 
'However, one tribe will remain for Solomon's son, for the sake of David My servant, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:33) 
'I will do this because Solomon has forsaken Me and has worshipped Ashtart, the false goddess of the Sidonians; Chemosh, the false god of the Moabites; and Moloch, the false god of the children of Ammon. He has not walked in My ways, to do what is right in My sight, nor kept My commandments and My judgments, as David his father did.'

(1 Kings 11:34) 
'Nevertheless, I will not take the entire kingdom from his hand. Instead, I will let him remain ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose, and who kept My commandments and My precepts.'

(1 Kings 11:35) 
'But I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'

(1 Kings 11:36) 
'To his son, however, I will give one tribe, so that a lamp for David My servant may remain before Me always in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen, so that My name may be there.'

(1 Kings 11:37) 
'Therefore I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:38) 
'If, therefore, you listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, keeping My commandments and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty, a faithful house, just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'

(1 Kings 11:39) 
'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not for all time.'

(1 Kings 11:40) 
Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.

(1 Kings 11:1) 
King Solomon passionately loved many foreign women. This included Pharaoh’s daughter, along with women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittite people.

(1 Kings 11:2) 
These were women from nations about whom the Lord had strictly warned the children of Israel: 'You shall not marry them, nor shall they marry you. For they will most certainly turn your hearts away from Me, causing you to follow their false gods.' But King Solomon, in his deep affection, became joined to these women.

(1 Kings 11:3) 
He had seven hundred wives who were princesses, and three hundred concubines. And these women turned his heart away from God.

(1 Kings 11:4) 
When he became old, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he followed other gods. His heart was not perfectly devoted to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his father David.

(1 Kings 11:5) 
Instead, Solomon began to worship Astaroth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch, the idol of the Ammonites.

(1 Kings 11:6) 
Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not fully obey the Lord, as his father David had done.

(1 Kings 11:7) 
Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the idol of Moab, on the hill facing Jerusalem. He also built a high place for Moloch, the idol of the Ammonite people.

(1 Kings 11:8) 
In this manner, he did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their own gods.

(1 Kings 11:9) 
Therefore, the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel. This was especially grievous because the Lord had appeared to Solomon twice before.

(1 Kings 11:10) 
And the Lord had specifically commanded him not to follow other gods. But Solomon did not keep the commands that the Lord had given him.

(1 Kings 11:11) 
So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My commands which I entrusted to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to your servant.'

(1 Kings 11:12) 
'However, for the sake of your father David, I will not do this during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'

(1 Kings 11:13) 
'Nevertheless, I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will leave one tribe for your son, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.'

(1 Kings 11:14) 
So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal line in Edom.

(1 Kings 11:15) 
For when David was in Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom—

(1 Kings 11:16) 
Joab and all Israel remained there for six months, until they had completely wiped out every male in Edom.

(1 Kings 11:17) 
So Hadad himself fled, along with some Edomite men who were servants of his father, in order to enter Egypt. At that time, Hadad was just a small boy.

(1 Kings 11:18) 
When they set out from Midian, they came to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and then entered Egypt, presenting themselves to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with provisions, and even assigned him land.

(1 Kings 11:19) 
Hadad found such great favor with Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him as wife the sister of his own queen, Queen Tahpenes.

(1 Kings 11:20) 
The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh’s house, and Genubath remained in Pharaoh’s household with Pharaoh’s own sons.

(1 Kings 11:21) 
When Hadad heard in Egypt that King David had died and was resting with his ancestors, and that Joab, the commander of the army, was also dead, he said to Pharaoh: 'Allow me to leave, so I can return to my own land.'

(1 Kings 11:22) 
Pharaoh asked him: 'What, then, do you lack with me, that you seek to return to your own land?' But Hadad replied: 'Nothing at all. I only beg you to let me go.'

(1 Kings 11:23) 
God also raised up another adversary for Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.

(1 Kings 11:24) 
Rezon gathered men around him and became the leader of a raiding band, at the time when David defeated Hadadezer. They then went to Damascus, settled there, and began to rule in Damascus.

(1 Kings 11:25) 
Rezon was an adversary to Israel throughout all the days of Solomon's reign. This was in addition to the trouble caused by Hadad, and Rezon hated Israel, reigning in Syria.

(1 Kings 11:26) 
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, also lifted his hand in rebellion against the king. He was a servant of Solomon, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.

(1 Kings 11:27) 
And this was the reason for his rebellion: Solomon had built the Millo, and had closed up the breach in the city of his father David.

(1 Kings 11:28) 
Now Jeroboam was a strong and capable man. When Solomon saw that the young man was diligent and industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.

(1 Kings 11:29) 
It happened at that time, as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak, and they were the only two people in the open field.

(1 Kings 11:30) 
Ahijah then took his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.

(1 Kings 11:31) 
And Ahijah said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself. For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: "Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom away from the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes."

(1 Kings 11:32) 
'But one tribe will remain for Solomon's son, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:33) 
'This judgment comes because Solomon has abandoned Me. He has worshipped Astaroth, the goddess of the Sidonians; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Moloch, the god of the Ammonite people. He has not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My sight, nor kept My commands and My judgments, as his father David did.'

(1 Kings 11:34) 
'However, I will not take the entire kingdom from his hand during his lifetime. Instead, I will let him remain ruler for all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose, and who kept My commands and My precepts.'

(1 Kings 11:35) 
'But I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'

(1 Kings 11:36) 
'And to his son, I will give one tribe, so that My servant David may always have a lamp burning before Me—meaning a continuous royal line and presence—in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for My name to be there forever.'

(1 Kings 11:37) 
'As for you, take power. You will reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:38) 
'If you listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, keeping My commands and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty, just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'

(1 Kings 11:39) 
'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, though not forever.'

(1 Kings 11:40) 
Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam rose up and fled to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.

(1 Kings 11:1) 
Now, King Solomon loved many foreign women, even Pharaoh's daughter who he had previously married, along with women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittites.

(1 Kings 11:2) 
These were from the nations about whom the Lord had strictly warned the children of Israel, saying: 'Do not mix with them, nor let them mix with you, for they will most certainly turn your heart away to follow their false gods.' Yet Solomon joined himself to these women with burning love.

(1 Kings 11:3) 
He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines. And these women did turn his heart away.

(1 Kings 11:4) 
When he was old, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he began to follow their foreign, false gods. His heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David.

(1 Kings 11:5) 
For Solomon began to worship Astarte, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech, the vile idol of the Ammonites.

(1 Kings 11:6) 
Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not fully follow the Lord, as his father David had done.

(1 Kings 11:7) 
Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites, on the hill that faces Jerusalem, and also for Molech, the idol of the children of Ammon.

(1 Kings 11:8) 
And in this same manner, he built cultic sites for all his foreign wives who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their own false gods.

(1 Kings 11:9) 
The Lord became angry with Solomon, because his mind and heart had turned away from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice before this time,

(1 Kings 11:10) 
and had commanded him concerning this very matter: that he should not follow foreign gods. But Solomon did not keep what the Lord had commanded him.

(1 Kings 11:11) 
Therefore, the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because this has happened within you, and you have not kept My covenant and My commandments which I gave to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to one of your servants.'

(1 Kings 11:12) 
'Nevertheless, I will not do this during your days, for the sake of your father David. Instead, I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'

(1 Kings 11:13) 
'But I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen as My holy city.'

(1 Kings 11:14) 
So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon—Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal lineage in Edom.

(1 Kings 11:15) 
For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom,

(1 Kings 11:16) 
for Joab and all of Israel remained there for six months until they had cut off every male in Edom.

(1 Kings 11:17) 
But Hadad himself fled, along with some Edomite men who were servants of his father. They headed for Egypt, because Hadad was still a small boy at that time.

(1 Kings 11:18) 
When they had risen up from Midian, they came to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and then entered Egypt to Pharaoh, the King of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with food, and assigned him land.

(1 Kings 11:19) 
And Hadad found such great favor with Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes.

(1 Kings 11:20) 
And Queen Tahpenes's sister bore him a son, Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh's house, so Genubath was in Pharaoh's household with Pharaoh's own sons.

(1 Kings 11:21) 
When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had fallen asleep with his fathers—meaning he had died—and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, 'Let me go, so that I may return to my own land.'

(1 Kings 11:22) 
Pharaoh said to him, 'What do you lack with me that you seek to go to your own land?' He replied, 'Nothing, but only let me go.'

(1 Kings 11:23) 
God also raised up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.

(1 Kings 11:24) 
Rezon gathered men around him and became a leader of raiders when David defeated Hadadezer. They went to Damascus and lived there, and Rezon reigned in Damascus.

(1 Kings 11:25) 
Rezon was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon. This was the harm caused by Hadad, and Rezon's hatred against Israel, and he reigned over Syria.

(1 Kings 11:26) 
Jeroboam also, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, was a servant of Solomon. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. And he lifted up his hand, meaning he rebelled, against the king.

(1 Kings 11:27) 
This was the cause of his rebellion: Solomon was building the Millo, and he had joined up the city of his father David—referring to the expansion of Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 11:28) 
Now Jeroboam was a strong and mighty man. And Solomon, seeing that the young man was diligently prepared for work, appointed him over all the labor force of the house of Joseph—meaning the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.

(1 Kings 11:29) 
It happened then, at that time, that Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet from Shiloh met him on the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak, and they were the only two men in the open field.

(1 Kings 11:30) 
Ahijah took hold of his new cloak which he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.

(1 Kings 11:31) 
And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you.'

(1 Kings 11:32) 
'But one tribe shall remain for him—meaning for Solomon's lineage—for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:33) 
'This will happen because Solomon has forsaken Me and has worshipped Astarte, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, the false god of the Moabites, and Molech, the vile god of the children of Ammon. And he has not walked in My ways, to do what is just before Me, nor kept My commandments and My judgments, as his father David did.'

(1 Kings 11:34) 
'I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him a ruler for all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My precepts.'

(1 Kings 11:35) 
'But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'

(1 Kings 11:36) 
'And to his son I will give one tribe, so that a lamp—meaning a lineage and kingship—may remain for My servant David for all days before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for My name to be there.'

(1 Kings 11:37) 
'Therefore, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.'

(1 Kings 11:38) 
'If, therefore, you will listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right before Me, keeping My commandments and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build for you a lasting house—meaning a dynasty—just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'

(1 Kings 11:39) 
'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this—meaning because of Solomon's sin—but not for all days.'

(1 Kings 11:40) 
Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.

(1 Kings 12:1) 
And Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all of Israel had gathered there to make him their king.

(1 Kings 12:2) 
When Jeroboam, son of Nebat, heard this news, he was still in Egypt, because he had fled there from King Solomon and was living in Egypt at the time.

(1 Kings 12:3) 
So the people sent for Jeroboam and called him back. Jeroboam and all the multitude of Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:

(1 Kings 12:4) 
Your father oppressed us with a very harsh rule. So now, you should lighten some of your father's harsh control and ease the very heavy burden he placed on us, and we will serve you.

(1 Kings 12:5) 
Rehoboam said to them: "Go away for three days, and then return to me with your answer." And when the people had left,

(1 Kings 12:6) 
Rehoboam consulted with the elder advisors who had served before his father Solomon when he was still alive. He said: "What counsel do you give me so that I may answer these people?"

(1 Kings 12:7) 
The elder advisors said to him: "If today you show obedience to these people, and serve them, and speak gentle words to them, they will serve you all your days."

(1 Kings 12:8) 
But Rehoboam abandoned the wise counsel of the elders, which they had given him. Instead, he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now his royal attendants.

(1 Kings 12:9) 
He said to them: "What counsel do you give me so that I may answer these people, who spoke to me, saying: 'Lighten the heavy burden that your father imposed on us' ?"

(1 Kings 12:10) 
The young men who had grown up with him answered, saying: "You shall speak to these people, who spoke to you, saying: 'Your father made our burden heavy, you relieve us.' This is what you shall say to them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins, meaning I am more powerful than him.'"

(1 Kings 12:11) 
"My father placed a heavy burden upon you, but I will make your burden even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges armed with barbs—'scorpions' as they are called."

(1 Kings 12:12) 
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had instructed, saying: "Return to me on the third day."

(1 Kings 12:13) 
So the king answered the people more harshly, having ignored the wise counsel of the elders, which they had given him.

(1 Kings 12:14) 
And he spoke according to the counsel of the young men, saying: "My father made your burden heavy, but I will make your burden even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges armed with barbs."

(1 Kings 12:15) 
The king did not listen to the people's pleas, because the Lord had turned his heart away from doing so. This was done to fulfill God's own word, which He had spoken through the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat.

(1 Kings 12:16) 
Therefore, when all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king, saying: "What share do we have any longer in David's lineage? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse's house, meaning we reject the royal line! To your tents, O Israel! Look to your own house, David—we disown your authority!" And so, the tribes of Israel went to their own encampments.

(1 Kings 12:17) 
However, Rehoboam continued to reign over the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, specifically the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

(1 Kings 12:18) 
Therefore King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of collecting the forced labor and tribute payments, to the rebellious tribes. But all Israel stoned him to death. Then King Rehoboam quickly mounted his royal chariot and fled to Jerusalem to escape.

(1 Kings 12:19) 
And so, the ten northern tribes of Israel permanently separated from the house of David's rule, a separation that continues to this very day.

(1 Kings 12:20) 
Now all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt. So they sent for him and called him to a gathering of all the people, and they made him king over all the tribes of Israel, except for the tribe of Judah alone, which remained loyal to Rehoboam.

(1 Kings 12:21) 
But Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a total of one hundred eighty thousand chosen warriors, intending to fight against the house of Israel—the northern tribes—and bring the kingdom back under his control.

(1 Kings 12:22) 
But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a prophet of God, saying:

(1 Kings 12:23) 
Speak to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people who are with him, saying:

(1 Kings 12:24) 
"Thus says the Lord: 'You shall not go up to fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Let each one return to his own house, because this division has been done by My will and My word.'" They heard the word of the Lord, and they turned back from their journey, just as the Lord had commanded them.

(1 Kings 12:25) 
Now Jeroboam rebuilt the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and established his residence there. And going out from there, he also rebuilt Penuel.

(1 Kings 12:26) 
And Jeroboam said in his heart: "Now, if things continue as they are, the loyalty of the kingdom will revert to the house of David."

(1 Kings 12:27) 
"If these people continue to go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord, then the hearts of these people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam, king of Judah. They will kill me, and return their allegiance to Rehoboam, king of Judah."

(1 Kings 12:28) 
So, after careful deliberation, Jeroboam made two golden calves. Then he said to the people: "You have traveled enough to Jerusalem. Look, O Israel, these are your gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!"

(1 Kings 12:29) 
He placed one golden calf in Bethel, and the other he placed in Dan, two cities at opposite ends of his kingdom.

(1 Kings 12:30) 
And this action became a great sin for Israel, for the people went to worship the golden calf even as far as Dan, engaging in idolatry.

(1 Kings 12:31) 
Jeroboam also made temples on the high places, meaning shrines on hills and mountains, and appointed priests from the lowest ranks of the people who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi.

(1 Kings 12:32) 
And Jeroboam appointed a feast day in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, mimicking the solemn feast that was celebrated in Judah, the Feast of Tabernacles. And going up to the altar, he did likewise in Bethel, to sacrifice to the golden calves which he had made, and he appointed priests of the high places which he had established in Bethel.

(1 Kings 12:33) 
And he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month—a feast day which he had devised from his own heart, not according to God's law. He made a solemn feast for the children of Israel, and he went up to the altar to burn incense.

(1 Kings 12:38) 
The Lord fulfilled this word which He had spoken to Jeroboam concerning the division of the kingdom.

(1 Kings 12:39) 
And because of this sin of Jeroboam, and the sin of his entire household, through which they sinned and caused all Israel to sin with idolatry, the Lord turned away Israel from Himself and delivered them into the hands of those who would plunder them.

(1 Kings 12:40) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, how he fought wars, and how he reigned as king, behold, these things are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

(1 Kings 12:1) 
Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, then went to Shechem. For all of the tribes of Israel had gathered there to declare him their king.

(1 Kings 12:2) 
When Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, heard this news—he was in Egypt at the time because he had fled there from King Solomon and was living in Egypt—

(1 Kings 12:3) 
they sent word and called him back. So Jeroboam and the entire assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying:

(1 Kings 12:4) 
“Your father, King Solomon, put a very heavy burden of forced labor on us. Now, therefore, lighten the harsh rule of your father and the heavy burden he placed on us, and we will be your loyal subjects.”

(1 Kings 12:5) 
Rehoboam replied to them: “Go away for three days, and then return to me for my decision.” So the people left.

(1 Kings 12:6) 
King Rehoboam then consulted with the elders, his oldest advisors, who had served before his father Solomon when he was still alive. He asked: “What counsel do you give me, that I may respond to these people?”

(1 Kings 12:7) 
They replied to him: “If today you are a servant to these people, and serve them well, and speak kind words to them, then they will be loyal subjects to you for all of your days.”

(1 Kings 12:8) 
But Rehoboam rejected the counsel of the elders, which they had given him. Instead, he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now his closest companions.

(1 Kings 12:9) 
He said to them: “What counsel do you give, or what should we answer to these people who have spoken to me, saying: ‘Take away from us the heavy burden that your father imposed on us’?”

(1 Kings 12:10) 
The young men who had grown up with him replied to him, saying: “This is how you should speak to these people who have said to you: ‘Your father made our burden heavy, but you should lighten it for us.’ This is what you should say to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.’ This means that I am even stronger and more demanding than he was.”

(1 Kings 12:11) 
“Now, my father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will add to your burden. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions—a much harsher instrument.”

(1 Kings 12:12) 
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had instructed, saying: “Return to me on the third day.”

(1 Kings 12:13) 
And the king gave the people a harsh answer, ignoring the wise counsel that the elders had given him.

(1 Kings 12:14) 
He spoke according to the counsel of the young men, saying: “My father made your burden heavy, but I will add even more to your burden. My father beat you with whips, but I will truly beat you with scorpions.”

(1 Kings 12:15) 
The king did not listen to the people because the Lord had turned him away from doing so. This was to fulfill His word, which He had spoken through His prophet Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.

(1 Kings 12:16) 
So when all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share do we have in David's lineage? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To your tents, O Israel! Now, let David—that is, Rehoboam, and the house of Judah—look to his own household!” So Israel departed to their tents, that is, to their homes.

(1 Kings 12:17) 
But Rehoboam continued to reign over the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.

(1 Kings 12:18) 
King Rehoboam then sent Adoram, who was in charge of collecting the forced labor tribute. But all the people of Israel stoned him with rocks, and he died. King Rehoboam, for his part, quickly mounted his chariot and fled to Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 12:19) 
Thus, Israel—meaning the ten northern tribes—separated from the house of David's dynasty and the tribe of Judah, a division that remains to this very day.

(1 Kings 12:20) 
Now, when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they sent for him and called him to a general assembly. They then made him king over all of Israel, with only the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin remaining loyal to Rehoboam.

(1 Kings 12:21) 
When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a force of one hundred eighty thousand chosen warriors—intending to wage war against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to himself.

(1 Kings 12:22) 
But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying:

(1 Kings 12:23) 
“Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying:”

(1 Kings 12:24) 
“Thus says the Lord: You shall not go up, nor shall you fight against your brothers, the sons of Israel. Let each one return to his own house, for this word, this division, has been brought about by My will.” Hearing the word of the Lord, they turned back from their journey and went away according to the Lord’s command.

(1 Kings 12:25) 
Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and lived there. After leaving there, he also built up the city of Penuel.

(1 Kings 12:26) 
Jeroboam said in his heart, that is, to himself: “Now the kingdom will certainly return its loyalty to the house of David, the family of Rehoboam.”

(1 Kings 12:27) 
“If these people continue to go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord, then the hearts of these people will turn back to their Lord, Rehoboam, the king of Judah. They will kill me and return to Rehoboam, the king of Judah.”

(1 Kings 12:28) 
So, after careful consideration, Jeroboam made two golden calves and said to the people: “You have been going up to Jerusalem for too long. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” This was an idolatrous reference to the golden calf made at Sinai.

(1 Kings 12:29) 
He placed one golden calf in Bethel, and the other in Dan, establishing new worship centers at the northern and southern extremes of his kingdom.

(1 Kings 12:30) 
And this action became a great sin, for the people went to worship the golden calf even as far as Dan.

(1 Kings 12:31) 
He also built temples on high places, and appointed priests from among all the people, even those who were not from the tribe of Levi, which was against God’s law.

(1 Kings 12:32) 
Jeroboam instituted a feast day in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, corresponding to the feast day that was celebrated in Judah. He went up to the altar himself, just as he did in Bethel, to offer sacrifice to the calves he had made. He also appointed priests for the high places he had made in Bethel.

(1 Kings 12:33) 
He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month—a month he had arbitrarily chosen for himself, not one appointed by God. He instituted this feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense.

(1 Kings 12:34) 
Therefore, according to this word, this was done, and on that day, he went up to the altar to burn incense.

(1 Kings 13:1) 
A man of God came from Judah to Bethel, commissioned by the Lord to deliver a message. He arrived just as King Jeroboam was standing before his altar, offering sacrifices to his false gods.

(1 Kings 13:2) 
The man of God then cried out against the altar, speaking a message directly from the Lord. He declared: 'Altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: Listen! A son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah, who will slaughter the priests of the high places—the very priests who are now burning incense on you—and he will burn human bones upon you in desecration.'

(1 Kings 13:3) 
And on that very day, the man of God gave a sign to prove the prophecy, saying: 'This is the sign that the Lord has truly spoken this: Watch! The altar will be split apart, and all the ashes on it will be scattered and spilled.'

(1 Kings 13:4) 
When King Jeroboam heard the man of God's message, which was cried out against the altar in Bethel, the king stretched out his hand from the altar and commanded: 'Seize him!' But at that instant, the hand he had stretched out withered, and he could not pull it back to himself.

(1 Kings 13:5) 
Also, at that very moment, the altar itself was split apart, and the ashes were spilled from it, just as the man of God had declared as a sign by the word of the Lord.

(1 Kings 13:6) 
Then the king said to the man of God: 'Please, pray to the Lord your God for mercy, and intercede for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.' The man of God earnestly prayed to the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him, becoming as it was before.

(1 Kings 13:7) 
The king then spoke to the man of God: 'Come home with me so you can eat and refresh yourself, and I will give you gifts as a reward.'

(1 Kings 13:8) 
But the man of God answered the king: 'Even if you were to give me half of your royal house, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this specific place of idolatry.'

(1 Kings 13:9) 
'For the Lord specifically commanded me in His word, saying: “You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor shall you return by the same way you came.”'

(1 Kings 13:10) 
So he departed by another road, and did not return by the same way he had come to Bethel.

(1 Kings 13:11) 
Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel. His son came and told his father all the works the man of God had performed that day in Bethel, and they recounted to their father the words he had spoken to the king.

(1 Kings 13:12) 
And their father asked them, saying: 'Which way did he go?' His sons showed him the road by which the man of God, who had come from Judah, had departed.

(1 Kings 13:13) 
Then he told his sons: 'Saddle the donkey for me.' When they had saddled it, the old prophet mounted it.

(1 Kings 13:14) 
He went after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth tree. He said to him: 'Are you the man of God who came from Judah?' The man of God replied: 'I am he.'

(1 Kings 13:15) 
Then the old prophet said to him: 'Come home with me, so you can eat bread.'

(1 Kings 13:16) 
But the man of God replied: 'I cannot return with you, nor can I come with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this particular place, as it is forbidden by the Lord.'

(1 Kings 13:17) 
'For the Lord spoke to me by His word, commanding: “You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor shall you return by the way you came.”'

(1 Kings 13:18) 
Then the old prophet said to him: 'I too am a prophet like you, and an Angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying: “Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.”' However, the old prophet was lying to him.

(1 Kings 13:19) 
So the man of God turned back with the old prophet, and he ate bread in the old prophet's house and drank water.

(1 Kings 13:20) 
While they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back.

(1 Kings 13:21) 
And the old prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: Because you did not obey the command of the Lord, and did not keep the instruction that the Lord your God commanded you,'

(1 Kings 13:22) 
'and instead you returned to eat bread and drink water in the very place where I commanded you not to eat bread or drink water, therefore your dead body shall not be brought to the tomb of your fathers for burial.'

(1 Kings 13:23) 
After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for the man of God whom he had brought back.

(1 Kings 13:24) 
As the man of God went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body lay cast out on the road, with his donkey standing beside it, and the lion also stood by the dead body, not harming the donkey.

(1 Kings 13:25) 
Then, behold, men passing by saw the body lying on the road and the lion standing beside it. They went and reported what they saw in the city where the old prophet lived.

(1 Kings 13:26) 
When the old prophet, who had brought the man of God back from the road, heard this, he said: 'It is the man of God who did not believe the word of the Lord! So the Lord delivered him to a lion, and it crushed him and killed him, just as the Lord had spoken through His own word to him.'

(1 Kings 13:27) 
Then he said to his sons: 'Saddle the donkey for me.' When they had saddled it, he mounted it.

(1 Kings 13:28) 
He went and found the man of God's body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing by the body. The lion had not eaten from the body, nor had it harmed the donkey, which was a miraculous sign of God's direct involvement.

(1 Kings 13:29) 
So the old prophet picked up the body of the man of God, placed it upon his donkey, and brought him back to his own city. The old prophet then mourned for him.

(1 Kings 13:30) 
He laid the man of God’s body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, crying: 'Alas, my brother!'

(1 Kings 13:31) 
After they had mourned him, the old prophet said to his sons, telling them: 'When I die, bury me in this same tomb where the man of God is buried. Place my bones beside his bones.'

(1 Kings 13:32) 
'For the word of the Lord that he spoke by the Lord's command against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come true.'

(1 Kings 13:33) 
Even after these events, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way. Instead, he continued to appoint priests for the high places from the lowest ranks of the people. Whoever desired it, he consecrated them to serve, and they became priests of the high places, which was a grave sin against God.

(1 Kings 13:34) 
Because of this sin, this became the cause of the downfall of Jeroboam’s house, leading to its complete destruction and utter removal from the face of the earth.

(1 Kings 13:1) 
And behold, a man of God from Judah arrived in Bethel with a message from the Lord. This happened while King Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer sacrifice.

(1 Kings 13:2) 
And the man of God cried out against the altar with a message from the Lord, saying: "O Altar, O Altar, this is what the Lord says: 'Behold, a son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah. He will sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who are now offering sacrifices on you, and he will burn the bones of men upon you.'"

(1 Kings 13:3) 
And on that same day, the man of God gave a sign, saying: "This will be the proof that the Lord has spoken: 'Behold, this very altar will be torn apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.'"

(1 Kings 13:4) 
Now, when the king heard the message of the man of God, which he had cried out against the altar in Bethel, King Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, ordering: "Seize him!" But his hand, which he had stretched out against the man of God, immediately withered, and he was unable to pull it back to himself.

(1 Kings 13:5) 
Furthermore, the altar itself was torn apart, and the ashes were poured out from it, exactly as the man of God had prophesied with a message from the Lord.

(1 Kings 13:6) 
Then the king said to the man of God: "Please intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God interceded with the Lord, and the king's hand was restored to him, becoming as it had been before.

(1 Kings 13:7) 
The king then spoke to the man of God, inviting him: "Come home with me to eat a meal, and I will give you gifts."

(1 Kings 13:8) 
But the man of God replied to the king: "Even if you were to give me half of your royal house, I would not go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place."

(1 Kings 13:9) 
For this is the commandment I received in a message from the Lord, who said: 'You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same road you came.'"

(1 Kings 13:10) 
So the man of God departed by a different road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.

(1 Kings 13:11) 
Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons came to him and told him all the deeds that the man of God had performed that day in Bethel, and they recounted to their father the words he had spoken to the king.

(1 Kings 13:12) 
Their father then asked them: "Which road did he take?" And his sons showed him the road by which the man of God, who had come from Judah, had departed.

(1 Kings 13:13) 
And he said to his sons: "Saddle a donkey for me." When they had saddled it, the old prophet mounted the donkey.

(1 Kings 13:14) 
He rode after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. The old prophet asked him: "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And the man of God replied: "I am."

(1 Kings 13:15) 
Then the old prophet said to him: "Come home with me to eat bread."

(1 Kings 13:16) 
But the man of God replied: "I cannot return or go with you. I will not eat bread or drink water in this place."

(1 Kings 13:17) 
Because the Lord spoke to me in a message, saying: 'You shall not eat bread or drink water there, nor shall you return by the way you came.'"

(1 Kings 13:18) 
And the old prophet said to him: "I too am a prophet like you, and an Angel spoke to me with a message from the Lord, saying: 'Bring him back with you to your house, so he may eat bread and drink water.'" The old prophet was lying to him.

(1 Kings 13:19) 
So the man of God returned with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.

(1 Kings 13:20) 
While they were sitting at the table, a message from the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back.

(1 Kings 13:21) 
And the old prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying: "This is what the Lord says: 'Because you did not obey the word of the Lord, and did not keep the commandment that the Lord your God commanded you,"

(1 Kings 13:22) 
—but instead you returned and ate bread and drank water in the very place where I commanded you not to eat bread or drink water—therefore your corpse shall not be brought into the tomb of your fathers.'"

(1 Kings 13:23) 
Now it happened that after the man of God had eaten bread and drunk water, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for the man of God whom he had brought back.

(1 Kings 13:24) 
When the man of God departed, a lion found him on the road and killed him. His corpse lay cast out on the road, with his donkey standing beside it, and the lion also stood beside the corpse.

(1 Kings 13:25) 
And behold, some men passing by saw the corpse lying on the road and the lion standing next to it. They came and reported what they saw in the city where the old prophet lived.

(1 Kings 13:26) 
When the old prophet who had brought him back from the road heard this, he said: "It is the man of God who did not obey the Lord's command! And the Lord delivered him to the lion, and it tore him and killed him, just as the Lord had spoken to him in His message."

(1 Kings 13:27) 
And he said to his sons: "Saddle a donkey for me." When they had saddled it,

(1 Kings 13:28) 
The old prophet went and found the corpse of the man of God lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing beside the corpse. The lion had not eaten from the corpse, nor had it harmed the donkey.

(1 Kings 13:29) 
So the old prophet picked up the corpse of the man of God and placed it upon the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city where the old prophet lived to mourn for him and to bury him.

(1 Kings 13:30) 
And he laid the man of God's corpse in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, crying: "Alas, my brother!"

(1 Kings 13:31) 
And it came to pass after he had buried him, the old prophet said to his sons, instructing them: "When I die, bury me in this very tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones."

(1 Kings 13:32) 
For truly the message will come to pass which he spoke with a message from the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel, and against all the shrines of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria."

(1 Kings 13:33) 
After these events, King Jeroboam did not turn back from his evil way. Instead, he continued to appoint priests for the high places from the lowest of the people; anyone who desired it could consecrate himself and become a priest of the high places.

(1 Kings 13:34) 
And because of this cause, the house of Jeroboam sinned, and it was utterly destroyed and wiped from the face of the earth.

(1 Kings 14:1) 
At that particular time, Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, became sick.

(1 Kings 14:2) 
Jeroboam then told his wife, "Get up and change your clothes, so no one will recognize that you are Jeroboam's wife. Then go to Shiloh, where Ahijah the prophet lives—the same man who told me that I would rule over these people of Israel."

(1 Kings 14:3) 
"Take with you five loaves of bread, a cake, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy—your son."

(1 Kings 14:4) 
So Jeroboam's wife did as she was told. She arose, went to Shiloh, and arrived at Ahijah's house. But Ahijah could not see, because his eyes were dim with old age.

(1 Kings 14:5) 
But the Lord had spoken to Ahijah, saying, "Look, Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, because he is sick. You are to tell her exactly these things." So when she entered and pretended to be someone else,

(1 Kings 14:6) 
Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came through the door, and he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another woman? I, however, am sent on a mission to you with a harsh message from God."

(1 Kings 14:7) 
"Go and tell Jeroboam: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: For as much as I exalted you from among the people, and made you a leader over My people Israel—"

(1 Kings 14:8) 
"—and I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. Yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with his whole heart, doing only what was pleasing in My eyes."

(1 Kings 14:9) 
"But you have done worse evil than all who were before you. You have made for yourself foreign gods, and molten images, to provoke Me to anger, and you have cast Me aside, behind your back."

(1 Kings 14:10) 
"Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male—every male, whether confined or completely free in Israel. I will utterly cleanse the remnant of Jeroboam's house, just as one cleanses dung until it is completely gone."

(1 Kings 14:11) 
"Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, dogs will devour him. And anyone who dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will eat him. For the Lord Himself has spoken it."

(1 Kings 14:12) 
"You, therefore, rise up and go to your house. And the very moment your feet enter the city, the boy will die."

(1 Kings 14:13) 
"And all Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. For he alone among all of Jeroboam's family will be brought to a burial place, because some good was found in him towards the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam."

(1 Kings 14:14) 
"Furthermore, the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will utterly cut off the house of Jeroboam, and that will happen on this very day and at this very time."

(1 Kings 14:15) 
"And the Lord will strike Israel, causing them to sway like a reed that is moved by water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the River Euphrates, because they made for themselves Asherah poles to provoke the Lord to anger."

(1 Kings 14:16) 
"And the Lord will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and caused Israel to sin."

(1 Kings 14:17) 
So Jeroboam's wife arose and departed. She came to Tirzah, and as she was crossing the threshold of the house, the boy died.

(1 Kings 14:18) 
They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, just as the Lord had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.

(1 Kings 14:19) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:20) 
The days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. Then he slept with his fathers—a euphemism for dying. And Nadab, his son, reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 14:21) 
Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. Now his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.

(1 Kings 14:22) 
And Judah did evil before the Lord. They provoked Him to jealousy with all the sins that their fathers had committed.

(1 Kings 14:23) 
For they also built for themselves high places, and sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every leafy tree.

(1 Kings 14:24) 
Furthermore, there were male cult prostitutes in the land, and they committed all the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:25) 
Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, marched against Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 14:26) 
And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house. He plundered everything, including the golden shields that Solomon had made.

(1 Kings 14:27) 
In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard, who stood watch at the entrance of the king's house.

(1 Kings 14:28) 
And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guards carried them, and then they returned them to the guardroom of the shield-bearers.

(1 Kings 14:29) 
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.

(1 Kings 14:30) 
There was also continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.

(1 Kings 14:31) 
Then Rehoboam slept with his fathers—he died—and was buried with them in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And Abijah, his son, reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 14:1) 
At that time, Abijah, who was the son of King Jeroboam, fell ill.

(1 Kings 14:2) 
And King Jeroboam said to his wife: "Go now, and disguise yourself by changing your clothes, so no one will recognize that you are the wife of King Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh, where Ahijah the prophet lives—the same prophet who told me I would be king over this people."

(1 Kings 14:3) 
"Also, take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Go to him, and he will tell you what will happen to the boy."

(1 Kings 14:4) 
So King Jeroboam's wife did as he had told her. She got up and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah's house. But the prophet could not see, because his eyes had become dim from old age.

(1 Kings 14:5) 
But the Lord had said to Ahijah: "Look, King Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, who is sick. Tell her exactly these things." So when she came in, pretending to be someone else,

(1 Kings 14:6) 
Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she entered through the door, and he said: "Come in, wife of King Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone you are not? I have been sent to you with a harsh message."

(1 Kings 14:7) 
"Go and tell King Jeroboam: 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I elevated you from among the common people and made you a leader over My people, Israel."

(1 Kings 14:8) 
'I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. Yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with his whole heart, doing only what was pleasing in My sight.

(1 Kings 14:9) 
'Instead, you have done more evil than all who were before you. You have made for yourself foreign gods, idols cast from metal, to provoke My wrath, and you have cast Me aside, forgetting about Me completely.

(1 Kings 14:10) 
'Therefore, behold, I will bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male descendant, whether slave or free, the lowest and the last in Israel. I will utterly sweep away the remnant of Jeroboam's house, just as one sweeps away dung until it is completely gone.'

(1 Kings 14:11) 
'Those of Jeroboam's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the open country will be devoured by the birds of the sky. This is because the Lord Himself has spoken it.'"

(1 Kings 14:12) 
Ahijah continued, "As for you, get up and go back to your house. The very moment your feet enter the city, the boy will die."

(1 Kings 14:13) 
"All of Israel will mourn him and bury him. For he alone among Jeroboam's family will be laid in a proper grave, because in him alone, in the house of Jeroboam, a good word concerning the Lord God of Israel was found."

(1 Kings 14:14) 
"Moreover, the Lord will raise up a king over Israel for Himself, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam—and this will happen quickly, at the appointed time."

(1 Kings 14:15) 
"And the Lord will strike Israel, shaking them like a reed is shaken in water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their ancestors, and scatter them beyond the great river, because they made for themselves sacred poles, provoking the Lord to anger."

(1 Kings 14:16) 
"And the Lord will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and led Israel into sin."

(1 Kings 14:17) 
So Jeroboam's wife got up and left, and came to Tirzah. And as she stepped across the threshold of the house, the boy died.

(1 Kings 14:18) 
They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, just as the Lord had declared through His servant, Ahijah the prophet.

(1 Kings 14:19) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam—how he fought wars and how he reigned—behold, these are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:20) 
The length of King Jeroboam's reign was twenty-two years. He then died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 14:21) 
Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was ruling in Judah at this time. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to establish His presence there. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.

(1 Kings 14:22) 
And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him more than all that their ancestors had done through the sins they committed.

(1 Kings 14:23) 
For they also built for themselves high places, pillars, and sacred groves upon every high hill and under every lush tree, engaging in idolatry.

(1 Kings 14:24) 
Moreover, there were also male prostitutes for cultic purposes in the land, and they committed all the detestable practices of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out before the people of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:25) 
Now, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak king of Egypt marched up against Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 14:26) 
He carried off the treasures of the Lord's house and the treasures of the royal palace. He plundered everything, including the golden shields that King Solomon had made.

(1 Kings 14:27) 
In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guards, who protected the entrance of the royal palace.

(1 Kings 14:28) 
And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards who walked before him would carry these shields, and then return them to the guardroom.

(1 Kings 14:29) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(1 Kings 14:30) 
There was continuous warfare between King Rehoboam and King Jeroboam throughout all their days.

(1 Kings 14:31) 
And Rehoboam died and was laid to rest with his ancestors in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. And his son Abijam reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 14:1) 
At that time—while Jeroboam was reigning as king—his son, Abijah, became very ill.

(1 Kings 14:2) 
And King Jeroboam said to his wife, "Get up, change your clothing so that no one will recognize that you are the queen, King Jeroboam's wife. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet lives there—he's the one who told me that I would be king over this people, Israel."

(1 Kings 14:3) 
"Take ten loaves of bread with you, along with some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the child."

(1 Kings 14:4) 
So Jeroboam's wife did as her husband instructed. She got up, went to Shiloh, and arrived at Ahijah's house. Ahijah, however, could not see anything, because his eyes were dim and clouded due to his old age.

(1 Kings 14:5) 
But the Lord God had already spoken to Ahijah, saying, "Look, Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, who is sick. You are to tell her exactly this and this—all that I am about to reveal to you." So when she came in, she pretended to be someone else, to hide her identity.

(1 Kings 14:6) 
As Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps entering through the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have been sent by God to you with a harsh message for your husband."

(1 Kings 14:7) 
"Go, and tell Jeroboam this: 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: Because I lifted you up from among the common people and made you a leader over My people Israel—"

(1 Kings 14:8) 
"—and I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was pleasing in My sight—"

(1 Kings 14:9) 
"—instead, you have done more evil than all who were before you. You have made other, false gods for yourself, and molten images, simply to provoke Me to anger. You have completely cast Me behind your back, disregarding My authority and My Law."

(1 Kings 14:10) 
"Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, whether slave or free, even the last remaining one in Israel. I will thoroughly cleanse the remnants of Jeroboam's house, just as one cleans away dung until nothing is left."

(1 Kings 14:11) 
"Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs. And anyone of his family who dies in the open country will be devoured by the birds of the sky. This will happen because the Lord God Himself has spoken it."

(1 Kings 14:12) 
"So you, get up and go to your house. The very moment your feet enter the city, the boy, your son, will die."

(1 Kings 14:13) 
"All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him with honor. For of all Jeroboam's family, only this child will be brought to a proper burial, because in him alone was found some good intention toward the Lord God of Israel, even within the wicked house of Jeroboam."

(1 Kings 14:14) 
"Moreover, the Lord God will raise up for Himself a new king over Israel, who will completely cut off the house of Jeroboam—this will happen on that very day, at that very moment."

(1 Kings 14:15) 
"And the Lord God will strike Israel, causing them to tremble and shake like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers, and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have made sacred groves and Asherah poles—symbols of idolatry—to provoke the Lord God to anger."

(1 Kings 14:16) 
"The Lord God will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who himself sinned, and who also caused all of Israel to sin."

(1 Kings 14:17) 
So Jeroboam's wife got up and left, and she came to Tirzah. And as she stepped over the threshold of her house, the boy died—just as the prophet had foretold.

(1 Kings 14:18) 
They buried him, and all of Israel mourned for him, exactly as the Lord God had spoken through His servant, Ahijah the prophet.

(1 Kings 14:19) 
The rest of the acts of Jeroboam—how he fought wars and how he reigned as king—behold, they are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:20) 
The days during which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. Then he rested with his fathers—that is, he died and was buried. And his son, Nadab, began to reign in his place.

(1 Kings 14:21) 
Now Rehoboam, Solomon's son, reigned over Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord God had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to establish His Name there, as a place of true worship. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.

(1 Kings 14:22) 
And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord God. They provoked Him to anger even more than all the sins their fathers had committed, through their own sins and their fervent idolatry.

(1 Kings 14:23) 
For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles for false worship upon every high hill and under every lush, green tree.

(1 Kings 14:24) 
There were also male cult prostitutes, referred to as 'sodomites' by their pagan practices, in the land. They committed all the abominations of the pagan nations whom the Lord God had driven out from before the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 14:25) 
Now, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, marched against Jerusalem.

(1 Kings 14:26) 
He plundered the treasures of the house of the Lord God, and the royal palace treasures, and he carried off everything. He even took away the golden shields that King Solomon had made.

(1 Kings 14:27) 
In place of the golden shields, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the care of the captains of the guard, who protected the entrance of the royal palace.

(1 Kings 14:28) 
Whenever the king would go into the house of the Lord God, the guards would carry the bronze shields before him, and then they would return them to the guardroom.

(1 Kings 14:29) 
The rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah.

(1 Kings 14:30) 
And there was continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.

(1 Kings 14:31) 
Then Rehoboam rested with his fathers—meaning, he died and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And his son, Abijam, began to reign in his place.

(1 Kings 15:1) 
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, Abiam began his reign over the kingdom of Judah.

(1 Kings 15:2) 
He reigned in Jerusalem for three years. His mother's name was Maacha, and she was the daughter of Absalom.

(1 Kings 15:3) 
Abiam persisted in all the sins that his father had committed before him. His heart was not entirely dedicated to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his ancestor, King David.

(1 Kings 15:4) 
Nevertheless, because of His servant David, the Lord his God granted Abiam a lasting dynasty in Jerusalem, so that He would raise up a son to succeed him and ensure that Jerusalem remained steadfast.

(1 Kings 15:5) 
This was because David had done what was right in the sight of the Lord God and had not turned aside from anything the Lord had commanded him all the days of his life, with the single exception of the matter involving Urias the Hethite.

(1 Kings 15:6) 
There was continuous warfare between Roboam, Abiam's father, and Jeroboam throughout all their days.

(1 Kings 15:7) 
As for the rest of Abiam's acts and all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? There was also ongoing war between Abiam and Jeroboam.

(1 Kings 15:8) 
Abiam died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. Then his son Asa became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:9) 
In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Asa began to reign as king over Judah.

(1 Kings 15:10) 
He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, the daughter of Absalom.

(1 Kings 15:11) 
Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord God, just as his ancestor David had done.

(1 Kings 15:12) 
He expelled the male cult prostitutes from the land and purified Judah of all the abominable idols that his ancestors had made.

(1 Kings 15:13) 
Furthermore, he even removed his queen mother Maacha from her position of authority because she had made a most abominable idol in a sacred grove. Asa cut down this idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley.

(1 Kings 15:14) 
However, he did not remove the high places, the unauthorized altars for worship. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was entirely devoted to the Lord God throughout his entire life.

(1 Kings 15:15) 
Asa also brought into the house of the Lord the silver, gold, and vessels that his father had consecrated through vows, as well as those he himself had consecrated.

(1 Kings 15:16) 
There was continuous warfare between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, throughout their reigns.

(1 Kings 15:17) 
Baasa, the king of Israel, went up against Judah and fortified the city of Rama. His intention was to prevent anyone from going out or coming in from Asa's kingdom.

(1 Kings 15:18) 
So Asa took all the remaining silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord and from the royal palace's treasuries. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with a message to Benadad, the son of Tabremon, son of Hezion, who was king of Syria and resided in Damascus. Asa's message was:

(1 Kings 15:19) 
Let there be an alliance between you and me, just as there was between my father and your father. I have sent you a gift of silver and gold for this reason: come and break your alliance with Baasa, king of Israel, so that he will withdraw his forces from me.

(1 Kings 15:20) 
Benadad agreed to King Asa's proposal. He sent the commanders of his army to attack the cities of Israel, striking Aion, Dan, Abeldomum Maacha, the entire region of Cineorth, and all the land of Nephthali.

(1 Kings 15:21) 
When Baasa heard this news, he ceased fortifying Rama and returned to Thersa.

(1 Kings 15:22) 
Then King Asa issued a proclamation throughout all Judah, commanding that no one was to be excused from participating. They dismantled the stones and timbers from Rama, which Baasa had used for construction, and King Asa used those materials to fortify Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.

(1 Kings 15:23) 
As for the rest of Asa's acts, his full strength, all that he accomplished, and the cities he built, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? However, in his old age, he suffered from a severe disease in his feet.

(1 Kings 15:24) 
Asa died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, his forefather. Then his son Josaphat became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:25) 
Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign over Israel in the second year of King Asa's reign over Judah. He reigned over Israel for two years.

(1 Kings 15:26) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God. He walked in the sinful ways of his father Jeroboam and perpetuated the sins by which his father had caused Israel to fall into idolatry.

(1 Kings 15:27) 
Baasa, the son of Ahia, from the tribe of Issachar, conspired against Nadab and struck him down in Gebbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines. At that time, Nadab and all of Israel were besieging Gebbethon.

(1 Kings 15:28) 
So Baasa killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa's reign over Judah and became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:29) 
Once Baasa became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam. He did not leave alive a single member of Jeroboam's lineage until he had utterly destroyed them all. This was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord God, which He had spoken through His servant Ahia the Shilonite.

(1 Kings 15:30) 
This destruction came about because of the sins Jeroboam had committed, and by which he had caused Israel to sin, and because of the great anger with which he had provoked the Lord God of Israel.

(1 Kings 15:31) 
As for the rest of Nadab's acts and all that he accomplished, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 15:32) 
There was continuous warfare between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, throughout their reigns.

(1 Kings 15:33) 
In the third year of King Asa's reign over Judah, Baasa, the son of Ahia, began to reign over all Israel from Thersa. He reigned for twenty-four years.

(1 Kings 15:34) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God, walking in the sinful ways of Jeroboam and perpetuating the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to fall into idolatry.

(1 Kings 15:1) 
In the eighteenth year that Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, was king, Abiam began his reign over Judah.

(1 Kings 15:2) 
He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom.

(1 Kings 15:3) 
He followed all the sinful ways that his father had established before him. His heart was not completely faithful to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his ancestor David.

(1 Kings 15:4) 
But because of David, His servant, the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem—meaning He allowed his lineage to continue after him, ensuring Jerusalem's stability.

(1 Kings 15:5) 
For David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not turned aside from anything the Lord had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter concerning Uriah the Hittite.

(1 Kings 15:6) 
There was also continuous war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their lives.

(1 Kings 15:7) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Abiam, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? There was also war between Abiam and Jeroboam.

(1 Kings 15:8) 
Abiam then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and they buried him in the City of David. His son Asa became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:9) 
In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa began his reign as king of Judah.

(1 Kings 15:10) 
He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom —this refers to his queen mother, who was his grandmother.

(1 Kings 15:11) 
Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done.

(1 Kings 15:12) 
He expelled the male cult prostitutes from the land and purified it from all the filthy idols that his ancestors had made.

(1 Kings 15:13) 
Moreover, he removed Maacha, his own queen mother, from her position of power concerning the sacred rites, because she had made an abominable idol for the Asherah grove. Asa then cut down her idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley.

(1 Kings 15:14) 
However, he did not remove the high places of worship. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was completely faithful to the Lord throughout all his days.

(1 Kings 15:15) 
He brought into the House of the Lord the silver, gold, and sacred vessels that his father had consecrated, along with his own consecrated gifts.

(1 Kings 15:16) 
But there was constant warfare between Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, throughout their lives.

(1 Kings 15:17) 
Baasha, the king of Israel, marched against Judah and began to fortify Ramah, intending to prevent anyone from leaving or entering Asa's kingdom.

(1 Kings 15:18) 
So Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the House of the Lord and in the king's treasuries. He sent it by the hand of his servants to Ben-Hadad, son of Tabremon, son of Hezion, the king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying:

(1 Kings 15:19) 
There is a treaty between me and you, just as there was between my ancestor and your ancestor. Therefore, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Come, break your alliance with Baasha, the king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.

(1 Kings 15:20) 
Ben-Hadad agreed to King Asa's request and sent the commanders of his army against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maachah, and all of Chinneroth, along with the entire land of Naphtali.

(1 Kings 15:21) 
When Baasha heard of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and returned to Tirzah.

(1 Kings 15:22) 
King Asa then summoned all of Judah, leaving no one behind. They carried away the stones and timber from Ramah that Baasha had been using for construction. King Asa then used these materials to fortify Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.

(1 Kings 15:23) 
Now, the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? However, in the time of his old age, he suffered from a severe foot disease.

(1 Kings 15:24) 
Asa then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and was buried with them in the City of David, his ancestor. His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:25) 
Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah. He reigned over Israel for two years.

(1 Kings 15:26) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of his father, and in the sins by which he had caused Israel to sin.

(1 Kings 15:27) 
Baasha, the son of Ahijah, from the house of Issachar, conspired against him. Baasha struck him down in Gibbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were at that time besieging Gibbethon.

(1 Kings 15:28) 
So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa of Judah and became king in his place.

(1 Kings 15:29) 
When Baasha began his reign, he struck down everyone in the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave a single living soul until he had utterly destroyed them all, according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite.

(1 Kings 15:30) 
This was because of Jeroboam's sins, which he had committed and by which he had led Israel into sin. It was also because of the offense by which he had provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger.

(1 Kings 15:31) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 15:32) 
There was also continuous warfare between Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, throughout their lives.

(1 Kings 15:33) 
In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, began his reign over all Israel in Tirzah. He reigned for twenty-four years.

(1 Kings 15:34) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in the sins by which he had caused Israel to sin.

(1 Kings 15:35) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, concerning Baasha, saying:

(1 Kings 15:36) 
Because I elevated you from the dust and appointed you as leader over My people Israel, yet you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused My people Israel to sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins:

(1 Kings 15:37) 
Behold, I will utterly sweep away the descendants of Baasha and the descendants of his house. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.

(1 Kings 15:38) 
Whoever belonging to Baasha dies in the city, dogs will devour him; and whoever belonging to him dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will consume him.

(1 Kings 15:39) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Baasha, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 15:40) 
Baasha then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah became king in his place.

(1 Kings 16:1) 
Therefore, the Lord God gave His message to Jehu, the son of Hanani, a prophet, directly against King Baasha, saying:

(1 Kings 16:2) 
“I raised you up from nothing, and I made you the ruler over My people, Israel. But you have behaved exactly like King Jeroboam.

(1 Kings 16:3) 
You have caused My people, Israel, to sin, and you have provoked My anger with their sins. Because of this, I will utterly wipe out Baasha and his entire family line.

(1 Kings 16:4) 
I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Those who die from Baasha’s family in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by the birds of the sky.”

(1 Kings 16:5) 
All the other events concerning King Baasha, everything he did, and all his battles — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?

(1 Kings 16:6) 
So Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah. Then his son, Ela, became king after him.

(1 Kings 16:7) 
Indeed, the Lord’s message had come through the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, against Baasha and his household. This was because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, making his house become like the house of Jeroboam. For this very reason, Jehu, the son of Hanani the prophet, had struck him down.

(1 Kings 16:8) 
In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Ela, the son of Baasha, began to reign over Israel in Tirzah. He reigned for two years.

(1 Kings 16:9) 
Then Zambri, one of his officials who commanded half his chariots, conspired against him. One day, Ela was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arsa, who was in charge of the palace there.

(1 Kings 16:10) 
Zambri entered and struck him down, killing him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Then Zambri became king in Ela’s place.

(1 Kings 16:11) 
As soon as Zambri began to reign and was seated on Ela’s throne, he wiped out Baasha’s entire family line. He left no male alive, nor any of his relatives or friends.

(1 Kings 16:12) 
So Zambri destroyed Baasha’s entire family, exactly as the Lord God had spoken to Baasha through the prophet Jehu.

(1 Kings 16:13) 
This was for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Ela. They had sinned and had led Israel into sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel with their empty idols.

(1 Kings 16:14) 
All the other events concerning King Ela and everything he did — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?

(1 Kings 16:15) 
In the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Zambri reigned for seven days in Tirzah. At this time, the Israelite army was besieging Gibbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines.

(1 Kings 16:16) 
When the army and all Israel heard that Zambri had rebelled and had killed the king, all Israel proclaimed Amri, the commander of the army, as their king right there in the camp on that very day.

(1 Kings 16:17) 
So Amri and all Israel with him marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.

(1 Kings 16:18) 
When Zambri saw that the city was about to be captured, he went into the royal palace. He then set fire to the palace and burned himself to death inside it.

(1 Kings 16:19) 
He died because of the sins he had committed. He had done evil in the sight of the Lord, following the path of Jeroboam and the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin.

(1 Kings 16:20) 
All the other events concerning King Zambri and his conspiracy — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?

(1 Kings 16:21) 
At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two factions. One half of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gyneth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Amri.

(1 Kings 16:22) 
However, the people supporting Amri eventually became stronger than the people supporting Thebni, son of Gyneth. So Thebni died, and Amri became the sole king.

(1 Kings 16:23) 
In the thirty-first year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Amri began to reign over Israel for a total of twelve years. He reigned in Tirzah for six of those years.

(1 Kings 16:24) 
Amri bought the hill of Samaria from Semer for two talents of silver. He built a city on this hill and named the city he built Samaria, after Semer, the original owner of the hill.

(1 Kings 16:25) 
Amri did evil in the sight of the Lord God. He acted with greater wickedness than all the kings who had been before him.

(1 Kings 16:26) 
He walked in every way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and in his sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. This was so he would provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their worthless idols.

(1 Kings 16:27) 
All the other events concerning King Amri, and the battles he fought — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?

(1 Kings 16:28) 
So Amri died and was buried in Samaria. Then his son, Achab, became king after him.

(1 Kings 16:29) 
Achab, the son of Amri, began to reign over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Achab, the son of Amri, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.

(1 Kings 16:30) 
Achab, the son of Amri, did even more evil in the sight of the Lord God than all the kings who had been before him.

(1 Kings 16:31) 
It was not enough for him merely to follow in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Additionally, he married Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians. Then he went and served Baal, even worshipping him.

(1 Kings 16:32) 
He even erected an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

(1 Kings 16:33) 
He also set up a sacred pole for Asherah. Achab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who had been before him.

(1 Kings 16:34) 
In Achab’s days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub. This happened exactly as the Lord God had spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun, many years before.

(1 Kings 16:35) 


(1 Kings 16:36) 


(1 Kings 16:37) 


(1 Kings 16:38) 


(1 Kings 16:39) 


(1 Kings 16:40) 


(1 Kings 16:1) 
The Lord’s message then came to Jehu, who was a prophet and the son of Hanani. This message was against Baasa, and it said:

(1 Kings 16:2) 
“I raised you from obscurity and appointed you as leader over my people, Israel. But you followed the ways of Jeroboam, and you caused my people Israel to sin, thereby provoking My anger with your sins.

(1 Kings 16:3) 
Behold, I will wipe out all of Baasa’s descendants and his entire household. I will make your household like that of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.

(1 Kings 16:4) 
Anyone from Baasa’s household who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs. And anyone from his household who dies in the open country will be eaten by the birds of the sky.”

(1 Kings 16:5) 
The rest of Baasa’s deeds, all that he accomplished, and his battles—are these not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:6) 
Baasa then rested with his ancestors and was buried in Thirsa. Then his son Ela reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 16:7) 
Indeed, through the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, the Lord’s message also came against Baasa and against his household. This was because of all the evil he had done before the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the works of his own hands, so that his household would become like the household of Jeroboam. For this reason, the Lord struck him down, as declared by Jehu, the prophet and son of Hanani.

(1 Kings 16:8) 
In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Ela, Baasa’s son, began to reign over Israel in Thirsa. He reigned for two years.

(1 Kings 16:9) 
Then his servant Zamri conspired against him. Zamri was the commander of half of Ela’s chariots. Ela, meanwhile, was in Thirsa, drinking and getting drunk in the house of Arsa, who was in charge of Thirsa’s palace.

(1 Kings 16:10) 
So Zamri rushed in, attacked, and killed Ela in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah’s reign. Then Zamri reigned in Ela’s place.

(1 Kings 16:11) 
As soon as Zamri began to reign and was seated on Ela’s throne, he struck down Baasa’s entire household. He did not leave alive a single male from Baasa’s family, nor any of his relatives or friends.

(1 Kings 16:12) 
So Zamri completely destroyed Baasa’s entire household, just as the Lord had declared against Baasa through the prophet Jehu.

(1 Kings 16:13) 
This destruction was for all the sins of Baasa and the sins of his son Ela, which they committed and which they caused Israel to commit, thereby provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.

(1 Kings 16:14) 
The rest of Ela’s deeds, and all that he accomplished—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:15) 
In the month of Theboth, in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Zamri reigned for seven days in Thirsa. Meanwhile, the army of Israel was besieging Gabathon, a city of the Philistines.

(1 Kings 16:16) 
When the people who were besieging Gabathon heard that Zamri had conspired and killed the king, all the people of Israel appointed their army commander, Amri, as king over Israel that very day.

(1 Kings 16:17) 
So Amri and all Israel with him marched up from Gabathon and besieged Thirsa.

(1 Kings 16:18) 
When Zamri saw that the city was about to be captured, he went into the king’s palace and set fire to himself along with the palace. Thus he died.

(1 Kings 16:19) 
He died because of his sins, which he had committed by doing evil in the Lord’s sight, by following the way of Jeroboam, and by the sins with which he had caused Israel to sin.

(1 Kings 16:20) 
The rest of Zamri’s deeds, his conspiracy, and his acts of tyranny—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:21) 
Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half of the people followed Thebni, son of Gineth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Amri.

(1 Kings 16:22) 
However, Amri’s supporters proved stronger than the supporters of Thebni, son of Gineth. So Thebni died, and Amri began to reign.

(1 Kings 16:23) 
In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Amri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned in Thirsa for six of those years.

(1 Kings 16:24) 
He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for one hundred talents of silver. He built a city on this hill and named the city he founded Samaria, after Shemer, the original owner of the hill.

(1 Kings 16:25) 
Amri did evil in the Lord’s sight, acting more wickedly than all who had come before him.

(1 Kings 16:26) 
He followed the path of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and continued in his sins, which caused Israel to sin. This provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.

(1 Kings 16:27) 
The rest of Amri’s deeds, and the battles he fought—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:28) 
Amri then rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. His son Achab reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 16:29) 
Achab, Amri’s son, began to reign over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah’s reign. Achab, Amri’s son, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.

(1 Kings 16:30) 
Achab, Amri’s son, did more evil in the Lord’s sight than all who had come before him.

(1 Kings 16:31) 
It was not enough for him to follow the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat. Additionally, he took Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, as his wife. Then he went and served Baal and worshipped him.

(1 Kings 16:32) 
He even built an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had constructed in Samaria.

(1 Kings 16:33) 
Achab also made an idolatrous pole and continued to do more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who had come before him.

(1 Kings 16:34) 
In Achab’s days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son, Segub. This happened exactly as the Lord had declared through Josue, son of Nun, many years before.

(1 Kings 16:1) 
Now, the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, who was a prophet. It was a word against Baasa, saying:

(1 Kings 16:2) 
Because I raised you up from the dust, and I appointed you as a leader over my people, Israel, yet you walked in the ways of Jeroboam. You made my people, Israel, commit sin, thus provoking me to anger with their sins.

(1 Kings 16:3) 
Therefore, behold, I will completely sweep away Baasa's descendants, and the descendants of his household. I will make your household like the household of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.

(1 Kings 16:4) 
Those of Baasa's family who die within the city will be devoured by dogs. And those of his family who die out in the countryside will be consumed by the birds of the sky.

(1 Kings 16:5) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Baasa, and all that he accomplished, and his battles—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:6) 
So Baasa passed away and was buried in Thersa. Then his son Ela became king in his place.

(1 Kings 16:7) 
Indeed, it was through the hand of Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet, that the word of the Lord came against Baasa and against his household. It was against all the wickedness he had done before the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the works of his own hands—so that his house would become like the house of Jeroboam. It was for this very reason that the Lord's judgment brought about his end, as pronounced by Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet.

(1 Kings 16:8) 
In the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, Ela, the son of Baasa, began to reign over Israel in Thersa. He reigned for two years.

(1 Kings 16:9) 
And Zambri, his servant and the captain of half his chariots, rebelled against him. Now, Ela was in Thersa, drinking excessively and indulging himself in the house of Arsa, who was the governor of Thersa.

(1 Kings 16:10) 
Zambri went in, struck him down, and killed him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, and then Zambri became king in Ela's place.

(1 Kings 16:11) 
As soon as Zambri began his reign and took his seat on the throne, he struck down the entire household of Baasa. He did not leave alive a single male descendant, nor any of his relatives or friends.

(1 Kings 16:12) 
So Zambri completely destroyed the entire household of Baasa. This was exactly according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Jehu the prophet, against Baasa.

(1 Kings 16:13) 
This destruction was on account of all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of his son Ela. They sinned themselves and also caused Israel to sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.

(1 Kings 16:14) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Ela, and all that he accomplished—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:15) 
In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zambri reigned for only seven days in Thersa. At that time, the Israelite army was besieging Gebbethon, a city of the Philistines.

(1 Kings 16:16) 
When the army besieging the city, and all of Israel, heard that Zambri had taken the kingdom by force and had murdered the king, all of Israel, on that very day, in the military camp, appointed Omri, the commander of the army, as king over Israel.

(1 Kings 16:17) 
So Omri, with all of Israel who were with him, marched up from Gebbethon and laid siege to Thersa.

(1 Kings 16:18) 
When Zambri saw that the city was being captured and that he himself was about to be overcome, he went into the royal palace, to the inner citadel of the king's house. He then set the king's house on fire around himself, and he died in the flames.

(1 Kings 16:19) 
This was due to his sins, which he committed by doing evil in the sight of the Lord. He walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin, he led Israel to sin.

(1 Kings 16:20) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Zambri, and his conspiracy and his tyrannical rule—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:21) 
At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gineth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Omri.

(1 Kings 16:22) 
However, the people who were with Omri proved stronger than the people who followed Thebni, the son of Gineth. So Thebni died, and Omri began to reign.

(1 Kings 16:23) 
In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel. He reigned for twelve years in total, and for six of those years, he reigned in Thersa.

(1 Kings 16:24) 
He then purchased the hill of Samaria from Semer for four hundred talents of silver. He built a city on that hill, and he named the city he had constructed Samaria, after Semer, the original owner of the hill.

(1 Kings 16:25) 
Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he acted more wickedly than all those who had been kings before him.

(1 Kings 16:26) 
He walked in every way of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, and in the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. Omri did all of this to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.

(1 Kings 16:27) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Omri, and all the works he accomplished, and his battles—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 16:28) 
So Omri passed away and was buried in Samaria. Then his son Achab became king in his place.

(1 Kings 16:29) 
Achab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa, king of Judah. Achab, the son of Omri, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.

(1 Kings 16:30) 
Achab, the son of Omri, did more evil in the sight of the Lord than all the kings who had been before him.

(1 Kings 16:31) 
It was not enough for him merely to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat. In addition, he took Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, as his wife. Then he went and served Baal, and he worshipped that false god.

(1 Kings 16:32) 
He even erected an altar for Baal inside the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

(1 Kings 16:33) 
He also made an Asherah pole—a pagan idol dedicated to a goddess. Achab added even more wicked deeds, surpassing all the kings of Israel who had been before him, all in order to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger.

(1 Kings 16:34) 
In Achab's days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son, Segub. This happened according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun, many centuries earlier.

(1 Kings 17:1) 
And Elijah the Tishbite, one of the settlers from Gilead, said to King Ahab: "As the Lord God of Israel lives, in whose presence I serve, there will be no dew or rain for the coming years, unless I command it by my word."

(1 Kings 17:2) 
And the word of the Lord came to Elijah, saying:

(1 Kings 17:3) 
"Leave this place, and go east. Hide yourself in the Cherith Ravine, which is on the eastern side of the Jordan River."

(1 Kings 17:4) 
"And there you will drink from the ravine. I have commanded ravens to feed you there."

(1 Kings 17:5) 
So Elijah went and did as the Lord had commanded him. He went and stayed by the Cherith Ravine, which faces the Jordan River.

(1 Kings 17:6) 
Ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening. And he drank from the ravine.

(1 Kings 17:7) 
And it happened after a number of days that the ravine dried up, because no rain had fallen on the land.

(1 Kings 17:8) 
Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying:

(1 Kings 17:9) 
"Arise and go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. For I have commanded a widow woman there to provide for you."

(1 Kings 17:10) 
So Elijah arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, he saw a widow woman there gathering sticks. He called out to her and said, "Please bring me a little water in a cup, so I can drink."

(1 Kings 17:11) 
As she was going to get it, Elijah called after her, saying, "Please, also bring me a small piece of bread with you."

(1 Kings 17:12) 
She answered, "As the Lord your God lives, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering two sticks so I can go home and prepare it for myself and my son, so we can eat it and then die."

(1 Kings 17:13) 
Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid. Go and do as you have said, but first make a small flat cake for me from your flour and bring it to me. Afterwards, you can prepare some for yourself and your son."

(1 Kings 17:14) 
"For this is what the Lord God of Israel declares: 'The jar of flour will not be emptied, and the jug of oil will not run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain upon the face of the earth.'"

(1 Kings 17:15) 
So she went and did as Elijah told her. And she, and her household, and Elijah, had enough to eat for many days.

(1 Kings 17:16) 
And the jar of flour did not run out, nor did the jug of oil diminish, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah.

(1 Kings 17:17) 
Now it happened after these events that the son of the woman, who owned the house, became ill. His sickness was so severe that he stopped breathing and no life remained in him.

(1 Kings 17:18) 
So she said to Elijah, "What have you done to me, O man of God? Have you come to remind me of my sins and to cause the death of my son?"

(1 Kings 17:19) 
And Elijah said to her, "Give me your son." He took the boy from her arms, carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.

(1 Kings 17:20) 
Then he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, have You brought this tragedy upon the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?"

(1 Kings 17:21) 
Then Elijah stretched himself out on the boy three times. And he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, please let the life breath of this boy return to his body!"

(1 Kings 17:22) 
And the Lord listened to Elijah's prayer. The life breath of the boy returned to him, and he revived.

(1 Kings 17:23) 
Then Elijah took the boy and brought him down from the upper room into the house below. He gave him to his mother and said, "See, your son is alive!"

(1 Kings 17:24) 
And the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know by this that you truly are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord spoken through you is true."

(1 Kings 18:1) 
After many days—specifically, in the third year of the drought—a message from the Lord came to Elijah, saying: "Go and present yourself to King Ahab, so that I may send rain upon the earth."

(1 Kings 18:2) 
So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. There was a severe famine throughout Samaria, the capital city of Israel and its surrounding region.

(1 Kings 18:3) 
King Ahab had called Obadiah, who was the chief steward of his royal household. Obadiah, for his part, greatly feared and reverenced the Lord.

(1 Kings 18:4) 
For when Jezebel, the queen, was slaughtering the prophets of the Lord—who spoke truly for God—Obadiah had taken one hundred of these prophets and hidden them, fifty in one cave and fifty in another, and he had secretly provided them with food and water.

(1 Kings 18:5) 
So King Ahab said to Obadiah: "Go throughout the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we will find enough grass to save the horses and mules, so that all the animals do not perish entirely."

(1 Kings 18:6) 
Then they divided the land between themselves to search for water: Ahab went one way alone, and Obadiah went another way alone.

(1 Kings 18:7) 
While Obadiah was on his way, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized Elijah, he fell on his face and said, "Is it really you, my master Elijah?"

(1 Kings 18:8) 
And Elijah responded: "It is I. Go and tell your master, 'Behold, Elijah is here!'

(1 Kings 18:9) 
Obadiah then said: "What sin have I committed, that you would hand over your servant into the hand of Ahab, so that he may kill me?"

(1 Kings 18:10) 
"As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master, King Ahab, has not sent messengers to search for you. And when they replied, 'He is not here,' he made those kingdoms and nations swear an oath that you could not be found, so determined was he to find you or confirmation of your absence."

(1 Kings 18:11) 
"And now you tell me: 'Go and tell your master: Behold, Elijah is here!'"

(1 Kings 18:12) 
"For as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you away to a place I do not know. Then, when I go and report to Ahab that you are here, and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. And I, your servant, have feared the Lord since my youth!"

(1 Kings 18:13) 
"Has it not been reported to you, my master, what I did when Jezebel was slaughtering the prophets of the Lord? How I hid a hundred men of the Lord's prophets, fifty by fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water?"

(1 Kings 18:14) 
"And now you tell me: 'Go and tell your master: Behold, Elijah is here!' This will surely result in him killing me."

(1 Kings 18:15) 
Then Elijah said: "As the Lord of hosts lives, in whose presence I stand—meaning I am His servant ready to do His will—I tell you for certain that today I will appear before King Ahab."

(1 Kings 18:16) 
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him. And Ahab then went to meet Elijah.

(1 Kings 18:17) 
When Ahab saw Elijah, he said: "Is it really you, the one who troubles Israel by causing this famine and distress?"

(1 Kings 18:18) 
And Elijah replied: "I have not troubled Israel, but you and the house of your father have troubled it, because you have forsaken the Lord, the true God, and have followed the false gods known as the Baalim."

(1 Kings 18:19) 
"Nevertheless, now send word and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel. Also gather the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the Asherah poles—idols of a false goddess—who are supported and eat at Jezebel's table."

(1 Kings 18:20) 
Ahab sent out word to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets to Mount Carmel.

(1 Kings 18:21) 
Then Elijah approached all the people and said: "How long will you waver and limp between two opinions, unable to make a choice? If the Lord is truly God, then follow Him! But if Baal is god, then follow him!" And the people did not answer him a single word.

(1 Kings 18:22) 
Elijah then said to the people: "I alone remain as a prophet of the Lord, whereas the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men."

(1 Kings 18:23) 
"Let two oxen be given to us. Let them choose one ox for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood, but let them not put fire underneath it. Then I will prepare the other ox, and I will place it on the wood, and I will not put fire underneath it."

(1 Kings 18:24) 
"You are to call upon the names of your gods, and I will call upon the name of my Lord. And the God who answers by sending fire—He is truly God." And all the people answered and said, "This is an excellent proposal!"

(1 Kings 18:25) 
So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal: "Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you. And call upon the names of your gods, but do not put fire underneath."

(1 Kings 18:26) 
When they had taken the ox that had been given to them, they prepared it. And they called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying: "Baal, hear us!" But there was no voice, nor anyone who answered. And they kept leaping around the altar that they had made in a frenzied dance.

(1 Kings 18:27) 
And when it was already noon, Elijah mocked them, saying: "Cry out with a louder voice! For he is a god, surely, and perhaps he is speaking to someone, or he is in a private place, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and needs to be awakened."

(1 Kings 18:28) 
So they cried out with a loud voice, and, according to their custom, they cut themselves with knives and lances until they were drenched with their own blood.

(1 Kings 18:29) 
After noon, and when the regular hours for their prophecy had passed, they continued their prophetic frenzy according to their custom until the time of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice, no one who answered, and no one who paid any attention.

(1 Kings 18:30) 
Then Elijah said to all the people: "Come closer to me." And all the people came closer to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down.

(1 Kings 18:31) 
Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob—to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, "Israel shall be your name."

(1 Kings 18:32) 
And with these stones, he built an altar in the name of the Lord. He then made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of grain.

(1 Kings 18:33) 
He arranged the wood, and cutting the ox into pieces, he placed it on the wood.

(1 Kings 18:34) 
And he said: "Fill four jars with water and pour it over the burnt offering and over the wood." Again he said: "Do it a second time." And when they had done it a second time, he said: "Do it a third time also." And they did it a third time.

(1 Kings 18:35) 
The water flowed all around the altar and even filled the trench completely.

(1 Kings 18:36) 
And when it was time to offer the evening burnt offering, Elijah the prophet approached and said: "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your command."

(1 Kings 18:37) 
"Hear me, O Lord, hear me! Let this people know today that You, O Lord, are the true God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You once more."

(1 Kings 18:38) 
Then the fire of the Lord fell from heaven and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and even the dust, and licked up all the water that was in the trench.

(1 Kings 18:39) 
And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces and exclaimed: "The Lord—He alone is God! The Lord—He alone is God!"

(1 Kings 18:40) 
Elijah then said to them: "Seize the prophets of Baal! Let not one of them escape!" And when they had seized them, Elijah led them down to the Brook Kishon and killed them there, executing judgment on false prophets according to the Law of Moses.

(1 Kings 19:1) 
Achab then told Jezabel everything that Elias had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with a sword.

(1 Kings 19:2) 
So Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: "May the gods strike me down and do more if, by this time tomorrow, I do not make your life like the life of one of those prophets you killed."

(1 Kings 19:3) 
Therefore Elias was afraid, and he arose and went wherever his will led him. He came to Bersabee, which belongs to Juda, and left his servant there.

(1 Kings 19:4) 
But Elias himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. When he arrived, he sat down under a juniper tree and prayed that he might die, saying: "It is enough, O Lord. Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."

(1 Kings 19:5) 
He then laid down and fell asleep in the shade of the juniper tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said: "Arise, and eat."

(1 Kings 19:6) 
He looked up and saw, right by his head, a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. He ate, drank, and then lay down to sleep again.

(1 Kings 19:7) 
Then the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him, saying: "Arise and eat, for you have a long journey ahead of you."

(1 Kings 19:8) 
So Elias arose, ate, and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked for forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mount of God.

(1 Kings 19:9) 
When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: "What are you doing here, Elias?"

(1 Kings 19:10) 
Elias responded: "I am consumed with zeal for the Lord, God of all creation's armies, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking to take my life."

(1 Kings 19:11) 
Then the Lord said to him: "Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord." And behold, the Lord was passing by. A great and strong wind tore the mountains apart and broke rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.

(1 Kings 19:12) 
After the wind came an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the whisper of a gentle breeze.

(1 Kings 19:13) 
And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his cloak and went out, standing at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him, saying: "What are you doing here, Elias?"

(1 Kings 19:14) 
Elias responded: "I am consumed with zeal for the Lord, God of all creation's armies, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking to take my life."

(1 Kings 19:15) 
Then the Lord said to him: "Go, return on your way through the wilderness to Damascus. When you arrive there, you are to anoint Hazaël as king over Syria."

(1 Kings 19:16) 
You shall also anoint Jehu, the son of Namsi, as king over Israel. And Eliseus, the son of Saphat, from Abelmeula, you shall anoint as prophet in your place.

(1 Kings 19:17) 
And it shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazaël, Jehu will put him to death. And whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Eliseus will put him to death.

(1 Kings 19:18) 
Yet I will preserve for myself seven thousand in Israel: all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not worshipped him.

(1 Kings 19:19) 
So Elias departed from that place and found Eliseus, the son of Saphat, plowing with twelve pairs of oxen. He himself was with the twelfth pair. And when Elias came to him, he threw his cloak over him — a symbolic gesture of calling and succession.

(1 Kings 19:20) 
Immediately, Eliseus left the oxen and ran after Elias. He said: "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." Elias replied: "Go, and return. For what was my part, I have done to you."

(1 Kings 19:21) 
So Eliseus returned from Elias, took a pair of oxen, and sacrificed them. He cooked their meat using the wooden parts of the plows as fuel, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went after Elias, and served him.

(1 Kings 19:1) 
And Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, and how Elijah had executed all the false prophets with a sword.

(1 Kings 19:2) 
So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with a message: 'May my gods do to me and more also if, by this time tomorrow, I do not make your life like the life of one of those prophets he killed.'

(1 Kings 19:3) 
Elijah was afraid, so he got up and went wherever he felt led to flee. He came to Beersheba in Judah and left his servant there.

(1 Kings 19:4) 
Then he himself traveled into the desert, a day's journey. When he arrived, he sat down under a single juniper tree. He prayed for himself to die and said, 'I have had enough, Lord. Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.'

(1 Kings 19:5) 
He lay down and fell asleep in the shade of the juniper tree. Suddenly, an angel touched him and said to him, 'Get up and eat!'

(1 Kings 19:6) 
He looked, and there by his head was a freshly baked loaf of bread and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and then lay down and fell asleep again.

(1 Kings 19:7) 
And the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him and said to him, 'Get up and eat, for you have a long journey ahead of you.'

(1 Kings 19:8) 
So he got up, ate, and drank. And he walked for forty days and forty nights, sustained by the strength of that food, until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.

(1 Kings 19:9) 
When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said to him, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'

(1 Kings 19:10) 
He answered, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant. They have torn down Your altars, and they have executed Your prophets with a sword. And I am left all alone, and they are seeking to take my life away.'

(1 Kings 19:11) 
And He said to him, 'Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.' And behold, the Lord is about to pass by. And a great and powerful wind began to tear apart the mountains and shatter rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.

(1 Kings 19:12) 
After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the soft sound of a gentle breeze.

(1 Kings 19:13) 
And when Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak, and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him saying, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'

(1 Kings 19:14) 
He answered, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant. They have torn down Your altars, and they have executed Your prophets with a sword. And I am left all alone, and they are seeking to take my life away.'

(1 Kings 19:15) 
And the Lord said to him, 'Go, and return by your path through the desert toward Damascus. And when you arrive there, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Syria.'

(1 Kings 19:16) 
You are also to anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, as king over Israel. And Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who is from Abel-meholah, you are to anoint as prophet in your place.

(1 Kings 19:17) 
And it shall come to pass that whoever escapes Hazael's sword, Jehu will kill them. And whoever escapes Jehu's sword, Elisha will kill them.

(1 Kings 19:18) 
And I will preserve for Myself in Israel seven thousand people, all whose knees have not bowed down before Baal, and every mouth that has not worshiped him.

(1 Kings 19:19) 
So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, plowing with twelve teams of oxen; he himself was guiding the twelfth team. When Elijah came to him, he threw his cloak over him.

(1 Kings 19:20) 
Immediately, he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, 'Please allow me to go kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.' And Elijah said to him, 'Go and return! For what have I done to hinder you?'

(1 Kings 19:21) 
So Elisha returned from him. He took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them as a sacrifice, and with the plowing equipment, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he got up, went, followed Elijah, and served him.

(1 Kings 19:1) 
And Ahab informed Jezebel about everything Elijah had done, including how he had killed all the false prophets of Baal with a sword.

(1 Kings 19:2) 
So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying: 'May *my* pagan gods do this to me, and even more severe punishment add to it, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of those false prophets Elijah killed!'

(1 Kings 19:3) 
So Elijah was afraid, and rising, he left and went wherever his spirit carried him. He came to Beer-sheba in Judah, and he left his servant boy there.

(1 Kings 19:4) 
And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. When he arrived, and sat under a broom tree, he asked for his life to end, and he said: 'It is enough for me now, O Lord; take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors!'

(1 Kings 19:5) 
And he lay down and fell asleep in the shade of the broom tree. And behold, an angel of the Lord touched him and said to him: 'Rise and eat.'

(1 Kings 19:6) 
He looked, and behold, at his head was a hearth-cake—bread baked on hot stones—and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down to sleep again.

(1 Kings 19:7) 
And the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him, and said to him: 'Rise and eat, for a long journey still awaits you.'

(1 Kings 19:8) 
So he rose, and ate and drank, and he walked in the strength of that food for forty days and forty nights, all the way to Horeb, the mountain of God.

(1 Kings 19:9) 
When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and said to him: 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'

(1 Kings 19:10) 
He responded: 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies and heavenly hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have destroyed your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left, and they seek to take my life away.'

(1 Kings 19:11) 
And He said to him: 'Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.' And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore down the mountains and shattered rocks before the Lord. But the Lord was not in that violent wind.

(1 Kings 19:12) 
And after the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the sound of a gentle, soft whisper.

(1 Kings 19:13) 
When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him, saying: 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'

(1 Kings 19:14) 
He responded: 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies and heavenly hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have destroyed your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left, and they seek to take my life away.'

(1 Kings 19:15) 
And the Lord said to him: 'Go, and return on your way through the wilderness to Damascus. And when you arrive there, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Aram (Syria).'

(1 Kings 19:16) 
And you shall anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, as king over Israel. And Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who is from Abel-meholah, you shall anoint as a prophet in your place.

(1 Kings 19:17) 
And it shall come to pass: whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill him. And whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall effectively cause his death through divine judgment.

(1 Kings 19:18) 
Yet I will leave for myself in Israel seven thousand people, all whose knees have not bowed before Baal, and every mouth that has not worshipped him.

(1 Kings 19:19) 
So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, plowing with twelve yokes of oxen, and Elisha himself was with the twelfth yoke. And when Elijah came to him, he threw his mantle over him, signifying the passing of prophetic authority.

(1 Kings 19:20) 
Elisha immediately left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said: 'Please let me kiss my father and my mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.' And Elijah said to him: 'Go back to your family, and then return; for what have I done to you? (My action was a clear call to prophetic duty, not something to be lightly taken).'

(1 Kings 19:21) 
So he returned from Elijah, took a yoke of oxen, and sacrificed them. And he cooked their meat using the plowing equipment as fuel, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went, and followed Elijah, and served him as his attendant.

(1 Kings 19:40) 


(1 Kings 20:1) 
Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army, and thirty-two other kings were with him. He had many horses and chariots. He marched and fought against the city-state of Samaria and began to besiege it.

(1 Kings 20:2) 
Then he sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, into the city of Samaria.

(1 Kings 20:3) 
Ben-hadad's message said: 'This is what Ben-hadad says: Your silver and your gold are mine. And your finest wives and your children are mine as well.'

(1 Kings 20:4) 
The king of Israel responded, 'As you have said, my lord king, I am yours, and everything I possess belongs to you.'

(1 Kings 20:5) 
The messengers returned and said, 'This is what Ben-hadad says: I sent word to you, saying, "You shall hand over your silver and your gold, your wives and your children to me."

(1 Kings 20:6) 
Therefore, tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you. They will search your house and the houses of your servants, and they will seize and take away with their own hands whatever pleases them.'

(1 Kings 20:7) 
So Ahab called together all the elders of the land and said, 'Notice this, and see that he is seeking trouble with us. He sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and gold, and I did not refuse him.'

(1 Kings 20:8) 
Then all the elders and all the people said to him, 'Do not consent, and do not listen to his demands.'

(1 Kings 20:9) 
So Ahab responded to Ben-hadad's messengers, saying, 'Tell my lord the king: All that you first sent to me, your servant will do. But this second demand, I cannot do.' The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-hadad.

(1 Kings 20:10) 
Then Ben-hadad sent a message to Ahab, saying, 'May the pagan gods do this to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria is enough to fill the hands of all the people who are following me to battle!'

(1 Kings 20:11) 
The king of Israel responded, saying, 'Tell him: Let not him who puts on his armor boast as much as he who takes it off after victory.'

(1 Kings 20:12) 
Now it happened that when Ben-hadad heard this word, he was drinking with the other kings in their tents. He said to his servants, 'Prepare for attack!' And they positioned the army against the city.

(1 Kings 20:13) 
Then, behold, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said, 'This is what the Lord says: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord, the one true God.'

(1 Kings 20:14) 
Ahab asked, 'By whom will you do this?' The Lord replied to him, 'By the young men who are the servants of the provincial governors.' And Ahab asked, 'Who will begin the battle?' The prophet answered him, 'You will.'

(1 Kings 20:15) 
So Ahab mustered the young men of the provincial governors and found their number to be two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the common people of the sons of Israel, seven thousand in total.

(1 Kings 20:16) 
They marched out at noon. Ben-hadad, meanwhile, was drunk in his tents, along with the thirty-two kings who had been summoned to him.

(1 Kings 20:17) 
The young men of the provincial governors went out first. Ben-hadad sent out scouts who reported to him, 'Men have come out from Samaria!'

(1 Kings 20:18) 
Ben-hadad then said, 'Whether they have come out for peace, seize them alive; or if they have come out to fight, seize them alive.'

(1 Kings 20:19) 
So the young men of the provincial governors went out, and the rest of the army followed behind them.

(1 Kings 20:20) 
Each man struck down the opponent who came against him. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on his horse with his horsemen.

(1 Kings 20:21) 
So the king of Israel went out and struck down the horses and chariots, and he inflicted a great defeat on Syria.

(1 Kings 20:22) 
Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, 'Go, strengthen yourself, and take note and see what you must do. For when the year comes around again, the king of Syria will march up against you.'

(1 Kings 20:23) 
Now the servants of the king of Syria said to him, 'Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they overpowered us. But if we fight against them on the plains, we will surely overpower them.'

(1 Kings 20:24) 
Therefore, do this: remove all the other kings from your army, and put military commanders in their places.

(1 Kings 20:25) 
Then rebuild the number of soldiers, according to the previous army, and the horses as before, and the chariots as before. Then we will fight them on the plains, and we will see if we do not overpower them.' Ben-hadad believed their counsel and acted accordingly.

(1 Kings 20:26) 
And so, after seven years, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and marched to Aphek to fight against Israel.

(1 Kings 20:27) 
But the sons of Israel were also mustered and, having taken provisions, went out to confront them. They appeared like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians, in contrast, filled the entire land.

(1 Kings 20:28) 
Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and said, 'This is what the Lord says: Because the Syrians declared, 'The Lord is a god of the mountains, and not a god of the valleys,' I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord, the one true God.'

(1 Kings 20:29) 
They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle began. The sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.

(1 Kings 20:30) 
The remaining soldiers fled into the city of Aphek, and the city wall collapsed upon twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. Ben-hadad himself fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber.

(1 Kings 20:31) 
His servants said to him, 'Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us therefore put sackcloth on our bodies and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will save our lives.'

(1 Kings 20:32) 
So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes around their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said, 'Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let my life be spared!'' Ahab replied, 'If he is still alive, he is my brother.'

(1 Kings 20:33) 
The men took this as a good omen, quickly seizing upon his words, and said, 'Your brother Ben-hadad!' Ahab then said, 'Go and bring him here.' So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him come up into his chariot.

(1 Kings 20:34) 
Ben-hadad said to him, 'The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore. And you may establish trading quarters for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria.' Ahab said, 'I will make a covenant with you and then release you.' So Ahab made a covenant with him and released him.

(1 Kings 20:35) 
Then one of the sons of the prophets, according to a command from the Lord, said to his companion, 'Strike me!' But his companion refused to strike him.

(1 Kings 20:36) 
The prophet then said, 'Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, a lion will kill you!' And indeed, a lion found him and killed him.

(1 Kings 20:37) 
Then he went to another man and said, 'Strike me!' And the man struck him and wounded him.

(1 Kings 20:38) 
So the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself as if wounded, with his eyes covered by dust.

(1 Kings 20:39) 
As the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him and said, 'Your servant went out into the midst of the battle. And behold, when a man had turned aside, he brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If he escapes in any way, your life will be taken for his life, or you will pay a talent of silver.''

(1 Kings 20:40) 
'While your servant was distracted and busy here and there, the man suddenly disappeared.' The king of Israel said to him, 'That is your judgment, for you have decreed it yourself.'

(1 Kings 20:1) 
Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army, which included thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots. He then marched up to Samaria and besieged it, preparing to fight against the city.

(1 Kings 20:2) 
He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was inside the city.

(1 Kings 20:3) 
The message from Ben-Hadad said: 'Your silver and gold, your wives, and the best of your children are all mine.'

(1 Kings 20:4) 
The king of Israel replied: 'As you say, my lord king, I am yours, and all that I possess is yours.'

(1 Kings 20:5) 
The messengers returned to Ben-Hadad and delivered his response. But Ben-Hadad sent them back with a new message: 'I sent to you earlier, stating that you must give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.'

(1 Kings 20:6) 
'Therefore, by this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you. They will search through your house and the houses of your officials, and they will take away whatever they desire.'

(1 Kings 20:7) 
King Ahab called together all the elders of the land and said: 'Notice how this man is seeking to destroy us. He first sent for my wives and children, and my silver and gold, and I did not refuse him.'

(1 Kings 20:8) 
All the elders and all the people told him: 'Do not agree to this, nor listen to his demands.'

(1 Kings 20:9) 
So Ahab responded to Ben-Hadad’s messengers: 'Tell my lord the king: Everything you first demanded, I will do. But this latest demand I cannot fulfill.'

(1 Kings 20:10) 
The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-Hadad. Ben-Hadad then sent a message to Ahab, saying: 'May the gods punish me severely and even more if the dust of Samaria is enough to fill the handfuls of all the people who follow me!' —meaning, 'My army is so vast, Samaria will be utterly destroyed and turn to dust, and there won't even be enough dust to fill their hands.'

(1 Kings 20:11) 
The king of Israel responded to Ben-Hadad: 'Tell him this: One who is putting on his armor for battle should not boast as if he were taking it off after victory.'

(1 Kings 20:12) 
Meanwhile, Ben-Hadad and the other kings were drinking in their temporary shelters when this message was delivered. Ben-Hadad then said to his servants: 'Surround the city for attack!' So they surrounded Samaria.

(1 Kings 20:13) 
Then a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel, saying: 'The Lord says this: 'See this immense multitude? Indeed, I will deliver them into your hand today, so you will know that I am the Lord.''

(1 Kings 20:14) 
Ahab asked: 'By whose hand will this be done?' The prophet replied: 'The Lord says this: 'Through the young men who serve the provincial governors.'' Ahab then asked: 'Who will begin the battle?' And the prophet said: 'You will.'

(1 Kings 20:15) 
So Ahab counted the young men who served the provincial governors, and found two hundred and thirty-two of them. After them, he counted all the people, all the sons of Israel, totaling seven thousand.

(1 Kings 20:16) 
They marched out at noon. Ben-Hadad, however, was in his temporary shelter, drinking heavily with the thirty-two kings who had come to aid him.

(1 Kings 20:17) 
The young men serving the provincial governors were the first to march out. Ben-Hadad had sent scouts, who reported to him: 'Men are coming out from Samaria.'

(1 Kings 20:18) 
Ben-Hadad said: 'If they come out for peace, take them alive. If they come out to fight, capture them alive.'

(1 Kings 20:19) 
So the young men from the provincial governors' retinues marched out of the city, with the main Israelite army following behind them.

(1 Kings 20:20) 
Each Israelite soldier struck down his opponent. The Syrians fled in disarray, and Israel pursued them. Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on horseback with his cavalry.

(1 Kings 20:21) 
The king of Israel then rode out and struck down the Syrian horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter upon Syria.

(1 Kings 20:22) 
The prophet again approached the king of Israel and said to him: 'Go and strengthen yourself. Take note and consider carefully what you must do, because at the turn of the year, the king of Syria will return to fight against you.'

(1 Kings 20:23) 
The servants of the king of Syria said to him: 'Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they overpowered us. But it is better that we fight against them on the plains, and then we will surely defeat them.'

(1 Kings 20:24) 
'Therefore, do this: Remove the kings from their positions, each from his own post, and appoint governors in their place.'

(1 Kings 20:25) 
'Also, restore the number of soldiers who fell from your ranks, and replace the horses with their former number, and the chariots as they were before. Then we will fight against them on the plains, and you will see that we will surely defeat them.' Ben-Hadad believed their words and acted accordingly.

(1 Kings 20:26) 
So, at the turn of the year, Ben-Hadad assembled the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.

(1 Kings 20:27) 
Meanwhile, the sons of Israel were also assembled, and after taking provisions, they marched out to meet them. The sons of Israel encamped opposite them, appearing like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the entire land.

(1 Kings 20:28) 
Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and said: 'The Lord says this: 'Because the Syrians said, 'The Lord is a God of the mountains, and not a God of the valleys,' I will give this entire great multitude into your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord.''

(1 Kings 20:29) 
For seven days, they encamped opposite one another. On the seventh day, the battle began, and the sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.

(1 Kings 20:30) 
The remaining Syrian soldiers fled into the city of Aphek. And the city wall collapsed upon the twenty-seven thousand men who had survived. Ben-Hadad, however, fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber within a room.

(1 Kings 20:31) 
His servants said to him: 'Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Therefore, let us put on sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare our lives.'

(1 Kings 20:32) 
So they girded sackcloth around their waists and placed ropes around their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said to him: 'Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me live!'' And Ahab replied: 'If he is still alive, he is my brother.'

(1 Kings 20:33) 
The men took this as a good omen, and seized upon his words, saying: 'Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad is alive!' Ahab then told them: 'Go and bring him here.' So Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him get into his own chariot.

(1 Kings 20:34) 
Ben-Hadad said to him: 'The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore to you. And you may establish marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria. I will make a treaty with you, and then I will release you.' So Ahab made a treaty with him and set him free.

(1 Kings 20:35) 
Then one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, by the word of the Lord: 'Strike me!' But his companion refused to strike him.

(1 Kings 20:36) 
So the prophet said to him: 'Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you leave me, a lion will strike you down.' And when he had left the prophet, a lion found him and struck him dead.

(1 Kings 20:37) 
The prophet then found another man from the sons of the prophets and said: 'Strike me!' And that man struck him, wounding him.

(1 Kings 20:38) 
So the prophet went and waited for the king by the roadside. He disguised himself by putting dust on his face and covering his eyes and forehead, hiding his identity.

(1 Kings 20:39) 
As the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him, saying: 'Your servant went out into the midst of the battle. And when a man turned aside and brought another man to me, he said to me: 'Guard this man. If he escapes in any way, you will forfeit your own life for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver.''

(1 Kings 20:40) 
'While your servant was busy here and there, the man suddenly disappeared.' The king of Israel said to him: 'This is your judgment, which you yourself have decided.'

(1 Kings 20:1) 
So Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army. He had thirty-two other kings with him, along with their cavalry forces and chariots. They advanced, besieged Samaria, and began to wage war against it.

(1 Kings 20:2) 
He sent messengers into the city to Ahab, the king of Israel,

(1 Kings 20:3) 
saying: "Ben-Hadad declares this: All your silver and all your gold are mine. Your finest wives and your children are also mine."

(1 Kings 20:4) 
The king of Israel responded: "As you have said, my lord king, I am your servant, and all that I have is yours."

(1 Kings 20:5) 
But the messenger returned again and said to Ahab: "Ben-Hadad declares this: I sent word to you saying, 'You must give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.'

(1 Kings 20:6) 
Therefore, tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you. They will search through your palace and the treasuries of your officials. Everything that seems desirable to them, they will take and carry away."

(1 Kings 20:7) 
Then Ahab summoned all the elders of the land and said: "Notice and consider how this man is plotting against us. For when he sent for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, I did not refuse him."

(1 Kings 20:8) 
All the elders and all the people told him: "Do not consent, nor listen to his demand."

(1 Kings 20:9) 
So Ahab replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers: "Tell my lord the king: Everything that you first demanded from your servant, I will do. But this latest demand, I cannot fulfill." The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-Hadad.

(1 Kings 20:10) 
Then Ben-Hadad sent word to Ahab, saying: "May the gods deal with me, and add even more punishments, if there is enough dust in Samaria for each of my followers to fill their hands! This means Samaria will be utterly destroyed by my vast army."

(1 Kings 20:11) 
The king of Israel replied: "Tell him this proverb: 'Let not the one who puts on his armor boast as much as the one who takes it off.' In other words, don't boast before the battle is won."

(1 Kings 20:12) 
When Ben-Hadad heard this message, he was drinking with the other kings in their tents. He then ordered his servants: "Surround the city!" So they began to besiege the city.

(1 Kings 20:13) 
Then, a prophet approached Ahab, the king of Israel, and declared: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Have you seen this vast multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, so that you may know that I am the Lord God.'"

(1 Kings 20:14) 
Ahab asked: "By whom will you do this?" The prophet replied: "Thus says the Lord God: 'By the young men who serve the provincial governors.'" Ahab then asked: "Who will begin the attack?" The prophet answered: "You, yourself."

(1 Kings 20:15) 
So Ahab counted the young men who served the provincial governors, and there were two hundred and thirty-two of them. After them, he numbered all the people, the sons of Israel, who were seven thousand strong.

(1 Kings 20:16) 
They marched out at noon. Meanwhile, Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings who had come to assist him were drinking themselves drunk in their tents.

(1 Kings 20:17) 
The young men of the provincial governors went out first. Ben-Hadad sent out scouts, who reported back to him, saying: "Some men have come out of Samaria!"

(1 Kings 20:18) 
He commanded: "Whether they have come out to seek peace, capture them alive. Or if they have come out to fight, capture them alive as well!"

(1 Kings 20:19) 
So the young men of the provincial governors went out, and the rest of the Israelite army followed behind them.

(1 Kings 20:20) 
Each one struck down the man who confronted him. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on horseback with his cavalry.

(1 Kings 20:21) 
The king of Israel went out and struck down the Syrian horses and chariots, inflicting a great defeat upon Syria.

(1 Kings 20:22) 
Then the prophet came to the king of Israel and told him: "Go now, strengthen your forces, take note, and consider what you must do, because at the turn of the year, the king of Syria will come up against you again."

(1 Kings 20:23) 
But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: "Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they have overpowered us. But it is better that we fight against them on the plains, and then we will surely defeat them."

(1 Kings 20:24) 
Take this counsel: Remove all the kings from their positions in your army, and appoint commanders in their place.

(1 Kings 20:25) 
Then, restore the number of soldiers that you lost, and replace the horses with new horses, and the chariots with new chariots, just as you had before. We will fight against them on the plains, and you will see that we will surely prevail." Ben-Hadad trusted their advice and acted accordingly.

(1 Kings 20:26) 
So, after a year had passed, Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.

(1 Kings 20:27) 
Meanwhile, the sons of Israel were also mustered. They took provisions and marched out to confront the Syrians. The sons of Israel encamped opposite them, looking like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians completely covered the surface of the land.

(1 Kings 20:28) 
Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and declared: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Because the Syrians have said, 'The Lord is a god of the mountains, but not a god of the valleys,' I will deliver this entire vast multitude into your hand. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.'"

(1 Kings 20:29) 
They encamped opposite one another for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle began. And the sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.

(1 Kings 20:30) 
Those who remained alive fled into the city of Aphek, but the wall collapsed upon twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. Ben-Hadad, however, fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber within a room.

(1 Kings 20:31) 
His servants said to him: "Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us, therefore, put sackcloth around our waists and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare our lives."

(1 Kings 20:32) 
So they girded themselves with sackcloth around their waists and ropes upon their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said to him: "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please, let my life be spared.'"

(1 Kings 20:33) 
Ahab replied: "If he is still alive, he is my brother." The men took this as a favorable sign and quickly seized upon his word, confirming: "Indeed! Your brother Ben-Hadad!"

(1 Kings 20:34) 
Ahab then commanded: "Go and bring him here." So Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab invited him to step into his own chariot.

(1 Kings 20:35) 
Ben-Hadad then said to him: "The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore. You may also establish marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria. I will make a treaty with you." Ahab replied: "Therefore, I will make a treaty with you and then release you." So Ahab made a treaty with Ben-Hadad and set him free.

(1 Kings 20:36) 
At that time, a certain man from among the sons of the prophets said to his companion, by the word of the Lord: "Strike me!" But his companion refused to strike him.

(1 Kings 20:37) 
So the prophet said to him: "Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you leave me, a lion will strike you down." And when he departed from him, a lion found him and struck him down.

(1 Kings 20:38) 
He then found another man and said: "Strike me!" And this man struck him and wounded him severely.

(1 Kings 20:39) 
So the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with ashes on his face and over his eyes to appear wounded.

(1 Kings 20:40) 
As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him and said: "Your servant went out to the front lines of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a prisoner to me, saying: 'Guard this man. If he escapes, you shall pay with your own life for his life, or else you must pay a talent of silver.'"

(1 Kings 21:1) 
After these events, a certain time came to pass: Naboth, from Jezreel, owned a vineyard which was next to the royal palace of King Ahab, who reigned in Samaria.

(1 Kings 21:2) 
So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying to him: 'Give me your vineyard, so I can make it into a vegetable garden for myself, because it's so close to my royal house. I will give you a better vineyard for it, or, if you prefer, I will pay you its worth in silver.'

(1 Kings 21:3) 
But Naboth answered him: 'May the Lord be merciful to me! I will not give you the inheritance I received from my ancestors.'

(1 Kings 21:4) 
So Ahab returned to his house, gloomy and indignant because of the words Naboth the Jezreelite had said: 'I will not give you the inheritance from my fathers.' He threw himself onto his bed, turned his face toward the wall, and refused to eat any food.

(1 Kings 21:5) 
Then Jezebel, his wife, came in to him and said to him: 'What is this, that your spirit is so sad, and you are not eating any food?'

(1 Kings 21:6) 
He answered her: 'I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him: 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'

(1 Kings 21:7) 
Then Jezebel said to him: 'Are you truly reigning as king over Israel with confidence right now? Get up, eat your food, and cheer up! For I will certainly give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite!'

(1 Kings 21:8) 
So Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his royal signet ring. She then sent these letters to the elders and nobles, who lived in Naboth's city and with him.

(1 Kings 21:9) 
And this is what she wrote in the letters: 'Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.'

(1 Kings 21:10) 
'Then bring two worthless men, 'sons of Belial,' to accuse him, who will testify against him, saying: 'He cursed God and the king!' Then take him outside the city, stone him to death, and let him die.'

(1 Kings 21:11) 
So the men of Naboth's city—the elders and nobles who lived there with him—did as Jezebel had commanded them, just as it was written in the letters she had sent to them.

(1 Kings 21:12) 
They proclaimed a fast, and they seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.

(1 Kings 21:13) 
Then two worthless men, 'sons of Belial,' were brought in and seated opposite him. They testified against him before the assembled crowd, saying: 'Naboth cursed God and the king!' So they dragged him outside the city and killed him with stones.

(1 Kings 21:14) 
Then they sent a message to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.'

(1 Kings 21:15) 
When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she spoke to Ahab, saying: 'Get up, and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to agree with you and give it to you for money. For Naboth is no longer alive; he is dead.'

(1 Kings 21:16) 
When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, so that he could take possession of it.

(1 Kings 21:17) 
Now the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:

(1 Kings 21:18) 
'Get up and go down to meet Ahab, the king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Look, he is in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone down to take possession of it.'

(1 Kings 21:19) 
'And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: 'Have you murdered, and then also taken possession?' And then you shall add: 'Thus says the Lord: 'In this very place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, there will dogs also lick up your blood—yours, King Ahab!''

(1 Kings 21:20) 
And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Have you found me, my enemy?' Elijah replied: 'I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'

(1 Kings 21:21) 
'Behold, I will bring disaster upon you, and I will utterly sweep away your descendants, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, even the lowest, a 'pisser against a wall', both bond and free, every last one in Israel.'

(1 Kings 21:22) 
'And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, because you have provoked Me to anger and have made Israel sin.'

(1 Kings 21:23) 
'Concerning Jezebel also, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel in the open field near Jezreel.'

(1 Kings 21:24) 
'If any of Ahab's family dies within the city, dogs will eat him. But if any of them dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will eat him.'

(1 Kings 21:25) 
Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who had sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; for his wife, Jezebel, incited him and drove him to it.

(1 Kings 21:26) 
He became truly abominable because he followed idols, and he practiced all the detestable things that the Amorites had done, whom the Lord had destroyed and removed from the presence of the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 21:27) 
Now when Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, and he put on sackcloth over his skin, and he fasted, and he slept in sackcloth, and he walked around with a bowed head.

(1 Kings 21:28) 
And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:

(1 Kings 21:29) 
'Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself on My account, I will not bring this disaster in his own lifetime, but in the days of his son, I will bring the disaster upon his house.'

(1 Kings 21:1) 
Some time after these events, Naboth, a man from Jezreel, owned a vineyard in Jezreel, right next to the palace of Ahab, the king who ruled Samaria.

(1 Kings 21:2) 
So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: "Give me your vineyard so I can turn it into a vegetable garden, because it is very close to my palace. In exchange, I will give you either a better vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will pay you its full value in silver."

(1 Kings 21:3) 
Naboth replied to him, saying: "May the Lord forbid me from ever giving you the inheritance of my ancestors." The ancestral land was a sacred trust, not to be sold outside the family.

(1 Kings 21:4) 
So Ahab went home, sad and indignant because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said: "I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors." King Ahab then threw himself onto his bed, turning his face to the wall, and refused to eat anything.

(1 Kings 21:5) 
Then his wife Jezebel came in to him and asked: "Why are you so sad? Why aren't you eating anything?"

(1 Kings 21:6) 
He answered her: "I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him: 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you a better vineyard in exchange.' But he replied: 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"

(1 Kings 21:7) 
Then his wife Jezebel said to him: "Are you really the great king of Israel? Get up, eat something, and cheer up! I will personally make sure you get the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."

(1 Kings 21:8) 
So Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his royal signet ring, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city and who knew him.

(1 Kings 21:9) 
In these letters, she commanded: "Declare a public fast, and make sure Naboth is seated prominently among the people." A fast was often called in times of public distress or when investigating a serious sin, setting the stage for a false accusation.

(1 Kings 21:10) 
"Then, bring two wicked men—sons of Belial, meaning utterly worthless men—to testify against him, saying: 'You blasphemed God and the king!' After their testimony, take him outside the city, stone him to death, and ensure he dies."

(1 Kings 21:11) 
The citizens of Jezreel, including the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city, did exactly as Jezebel had commanded them and as it was written in the letters she had sent.

(1 Kings 21:12) 
They declared a public fast and seated Naboth prominently among the people.

(1 Kings 21:13) 
Then the two evil men, those wicked sons of the devil, were brought in and made to sit opposite Naboth. They testified against him before all the people, falsely declaring: "Naboth blasphemed God and the king!" Because of this false accusation, they dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death.

(1 Kings 21:14) 
They then sent word to Jezebel, saying: "Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead."

(1 Kings 21:15) 
When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab: "Get up, go and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, the one who refused to give it to you for money. For Naboth is no longer alive; he is dead."

(1 Kings 21:16) 
As soon as Ahab heard this, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, intending to take possession of it.

(1 Kings 21:17) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:

(1 Kings 21:18) 
"Go now, and meet Ahab, the king of Israel who lives in Samaria. Look, you will find him in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone down to take possession of it."

(1 Kings 21:19) 
"And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: Have you not both committed murder and seized possession? And beyond this, you must add: In the very place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, there also shall dogs lick up your blood.'"

(1 Kings 21:20) 
Ahab said to Elijah: "Have you found me, my enemy?" Elijah replied: "Yes, I have found you, because you have completely sold yourself out to do evil in the sight of the Lord."

(1 Kings 21:21) 
"Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly sweep away your descendants, and I will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel—both slave and free, the weakest and the strongest—leaving no one."

(1 Kings 21:22) 
"And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah: because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin."

(1 Kings 21:23) 
"Moreover, concerning Jezebel, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs shall devour Jezebel in the open field of Jezreel.'"

(1 Kings 21:24) 
"If any of Ahab's family dies within the city, dogs will eat his body. If any of them dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will devour his body."

(1 Kings 21:25) 
Indeed, there was no one else like Ahab, who completely sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; his wife Jezebel constantly incited him to do so.

(1 Kings 21:26) 
He became utterly detestable, because he followed idols, just as the Amorites had done—those whom the Lord had destroyed from the presence of the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 21:27) 
When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth directly over his bare skin, fasted, and even slept in sackcloth. He walked about with his head bowed down in deep humility and sorrow.

(1 Kings 21:28) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:

(1 Kings 21:29) 
"Have you not seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Therefore, because he has humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring this disaster in his own lifetime. Instead, I will bring the disaster upon his household in the days of his son."

(1 Kings 21:1) 
After these events, it came to pass that Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard near the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.

(1 Kings 21:2) 
So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: 'Give me your vineyard, so I can make a vegetable garden there, because it is close and near my own house. In exchange, I will give you a better vineyard; or, if it seems more convenient to you, I will buy it from you for its price in silver.'

(1 Kings 21:3) 
But Naboth answered him: 'May the Lord forbid me from giving you the inheritance of my fathers.'

(1 Kings 21:4) 
So Ahab came into his house, angry and indignant because of the refusal Naboth the Jezreelite had given him, saying: 'I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.' And he threw himself onto his bed, turned his face to the wall, and refused to eat any food.

(1 Kings 21:5) 
His wife Jezebel came in to him and said: 'Why is your spirit so troubled, and why are you refusing to eat food?'

(1 Kings 21:6) 
He answered her: 'I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and I said to him: "Give me your vineyard for money; or if you prefer, I will give you a better vineyard in exchange." But he answered: "I will not give you my vineyard."'

(1 Kings 21:7) 
So Jezebel his wife said to him: 'Are you the King of Israel, and you allow yourself to act this way? Get up, eat your food, and be cheerful! I will secure for you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'

(1 Kings 21:8) 
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his signet ring. She sent them to the elders and to the nobles who lived in Naboth's city and resided with him.

(1 Kings 21:9) 
And she wrote this in the letters: 'Proclaim a fast, and make Naboth sit in a prominent place among the people;'

(1 Kings 21:10) 
'and set two men, worthless scoundrels, against him to give false testimony and say: "You cursed God and the king!" Then, take him outside, stone him to death, and let him die.'

(1 Kings 21:11) 
So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived with him in the city, did as Jezebel had commanded them and as it was written in the letters she had sent to them.

(1 Kings 21:12) 
They proclaimed a fast and made Naboth sit in a prominent place among the people.

(1 Kings 21:13) 
Then they brought two worthless scoundrels, who sat opposite him and bore false testimony against him before the assembly, saying: 'Naboth cursed God and the king!' As a result, they led him outside the city and killed him with stones.

(1 Kings 21:14) 
And they sent word to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.'

(1 Kings 21:15) 
When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she spoke to Ahab, saying: 'Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to agree with you and sell it to you; for Naboth is no longer alive, but is dead.'

(1 Kings 21:16) 
When Ahab heard that Naboth was indeed dead, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

(1 Kings 21:17) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:

(1 Kings 21:18) 
'Get up, and go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Look, he is now going down to Naboth's vineyard to take possession of it.

(1 Kings 21:19) 
And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: "Have you murdered, and also taken possession?" And after this you shall add: 'Thus says the Lord: "In the very place where dogs licked Naboth's blood, there also will dogs lick your own blood."

(1 Kings 21:20) 
And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Have you found me, O my enemy?'

(1 Kings 21:21) 
And he answered: 'I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'

(1 Kings 21:22) 
'Look, I will bring evil upon you and will cut off your descendants. I will destroy from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both bond and free, and the very last in Israel.

(1 Kings 21:23) 
'And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have made Israel sin.'

(1 Kings 21:24) 
Also, concerning Jezebel, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs shall devour Jezebel in the field of Jezreel.'

(1 Kings 21:25) 
If Ahab dies in the city, dogs will eat him; but if he dies in the open field, the birds of the sky will eat him.

(1 Kings 21:26) 
Indeed, there was no one else like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; for his wife Jezebel incited him to do so.

(1 Kings 21:27) 
He became utterly detestable by following idols and all the abominable practices that the Amorites had committed, whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.

(1 Kings 21:28) 
When Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth over his flesh. He fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head bowed down.

(1 Kings 21:29) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'Have you not seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Therefore, because he has humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his own days. Instead, in the days of his son, I will bring the evil upon his house.'

(1 Kings 22:1) 
And three years passed without any war between Syria and Israel.

(1 Kings 22:2) 
Then, in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.

(1 Kings 22:3) 
The king of Israel then said to his servants, "Are you not aware that Ramoth-Gilead rightfully belongs to us, and yet we remain silent, allowing it to be taken from our hands?"

(1 Kings 22:4) 
He then asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you come with me to battle at Ramoth-Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you, just as you are with me; my people are with your people; my horses are with your horses." This means they are fully allied.

(1 Kings 22:5) 
Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, "Please, let us inquire today for a word from the Lord."

(1 Kings 22:6) 
So the king of Israel gathered four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should I go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should I hold back?" They all responded, "Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:7) 
Jehoshaphat then asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire through him?"

(1 Kings 22:8) 
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat replied, "Do not speak such words, my king."

(1 Kings 22:9) 
So the king of Israel called one of his eunuchs and told him, "Go quickly and bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah."

(1 Kings 22:10) 
Now, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were both sitting on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, in the threshing floor area near the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the other prophets were delivering their prophecies before them.

(1 Kings 22:11) 
And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, had made for himself horns of iron and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these horns, you will gore and scatter Syria until you have utterly destroyed them.'"

(1 Kings 22:12) 
All the other prophets were also prophesying similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and you will succeed, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:13) 
So the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Look, the words of all the prophets are unanimously declaring good things for the king. Therefore, let your words be like theirs, and speak good tidings."

(1 Kings 22:14) 
Micaiah replied to him, "As the Lord lives, whatever the Lord tells me to say, that is what I will speak." This shows his unwavering commitment to God's true message.

(1 Kings 22:15) 
So he came to the king. The king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we hold back?" Micaiah replied to him, "Go up, and you will succeed; the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:16) 
The king then said to him, "I adjure you, again and again, that you speak nothing to me but what is true, in the name of the Lord." The king knew Micaiah was being sarcastic.

(1 Kings 22:17) 
Micaiah then said: "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: 'These people have no master now. Let each one return to his home in peace.'" This was a prophecy of the king's death.

(1 Kings 22:18) 
So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me, but always evil?"

(1 Kings 22:19) 
Micaiah then said, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left." This describes a heavenly council.

(1 Kings 22:20) 
And the Lord said, "Who will entice Ahab, the king of Israel, to go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?" And one spirit said one thing, and another spirit said another.

(1 Kings 22:21) 
Then a certain spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, "I will entice him." The Lord asked him, "How will you do it?"

(1 Kings 22:22) 
And the spirit said, "I will go out and become a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." And the Lord said, "You will entice him, and you will succeed. Go out and do as you have said." This means God allowed the deception.

(1 Kings 22:23) 
"So now, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has decreed evil concerning you."

(1 Kings 22:24) 
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you instead?"

(1 Kings 22:25) 
Micaiah replied, "You will see on that day when you go into an inner room from chamber to chamber to hide yourself."

(1 Kings 22:26) 
The king of Israel then said, "Take Micaiah and lead him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the son of Amelech."

(1 Kings 22:27) 
"And tell them: 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of distress until I return in peace.'"

(1 Kings 22:28) 
Micaiah said, "If you ever return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Hear this, all you peoples!"

(1 Kings 22:29) 
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.

(1 Kings 22:30) 
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

(1 Kings 22:31) 
Now the king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, "Do not fight with anyone, neither small nor great, except with the king of Israel alone."

(1 Kings 22:32) 
So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they assumed he was the king of Israel and turned to attack him.

(1 Kings 22:33) 
But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord turned them away from him, causing them to turn from pursuing Jehoshaphat.

(1 Kings 22:34) 
However, a certain man drew his bow with careful aim and by chance struck the king of Israel between his lung and stomach. The king then said to his chariot driver, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."

(1 Kings 22:35) 
The battle raged on throughout that day, and the king of Israel remained standing in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died that evening, as the blood from his wound flowed into the floor of the chariot.

(1 Kings 22:36) 
And a herald cried out throughout the entire army before sunset, saying, "Every man to his own city, and every man to his own land!"

(1 Kings 22:37) 
So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.

(1 Kings 22:38) 
And they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, where the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves, just as the Lord had prophesied.

(1 Kings 22:39) 
As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, and everything he did, and the ivory house that he built, and all the cities that he constructed—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 22:40) 
So Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 22:1) 
Now, there were three years of peace between Syria and Israel.

(1 Kings 22:2) 
But in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.

(1 Kings 22:3) 
The king of Israel said to his servants, "Don't you realize that Ramoth in Gilead belongs to us? Why do we remain silent and not take it back from the king of Syria?"

(1 Kings 22:4) 
Then he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you come with me to battle in Ramoth-Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people are as your people, and my horsemen are as your horsemen. We are allies."

(1 Kings 22:5) 
Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, "Please, let us inquire of the Lord today to hear His word."

(1 Kings 22:6) 
So the king of Israel gathered the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, "Should I go to Ramoth-Gilead to wage war, or should I hold back?" They all answered, "Go up, and God will give it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:7) 
Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no other prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire through him?"

(1 Kings 22:8) 
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man through whom we could inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. That man is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat responded, "The king should not speak like that."

(1 Kings 22:9) 
So the king of Israel called one of his officials and ordered him, "Quickly, bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah."

(1 Kings 22:10) 
The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were sitting, each on his throne, dressed in their royal robes, in the open space at the entrance to the gate of Samaria. All the other prophets were prophesying before them.

(1 Kings 22:11) 
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these, you will gore the Syrians until you utterly destroy them.'"

(1 Kings 22:12) 
All the other prophets prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead! You will succeed in everything, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:13) 
The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Look, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."

(1 Kings 22:14) 
Micaiah replied, "As the Lord lives, I will speak only what the Lord tells me to say."

(1 Kings 22:15) 
When he came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to wage war, or should we hold back?" Micaiah answered him, "Go up, and you will succeed in everything, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand." This was said with sarcasm.

(1 Kings 22:16) 
The king said, "How many times must I make you swear by God that you will tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"

(1 Kings 22:17) 
Micaiah then said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These people have no leader. Let each one return to his house in peace.'"

(1 Kings 22:18) 
The king of Israel then said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me, but always evil?"

(1 Kings 22:19) 
Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left."

(1 Kings 22:20) 
And the Lord said, "Who will entice Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he goes up and falls in Ramoth-Gilead?" One spirit suggested one thing, and another suggested a different method.

(1 Kings 22:21) 
Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, "I will entice him." The Lord asked him, "How will you do it?"

(1 Kings 22:22) 
The spirit replied, "I will go out and become a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." The Lord said, "You will entice him, and you will succeed. Go out and do so."

(1 Kings 22:23) 
Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours who are here. And the Lord has spoken disaster against you.

(1 Kings 22:24) 
Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came up and struck Micaiah on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?"

(1 Kings 22:25) 
Micaiah answered, "You will see on that day when you go into an inner room, hiding from everyone, trying to escape."

(1 Kings 22:26) 
The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and lead him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son."

(1 Kings 22:27) 
And tell them, "The king says: 'Put this man in prison and feed him only meager rations of bread and water until I return victorious and in peace.'"

(1 Kings 22:28) 
Micaiah declared, "If you ever return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Listen, all you people!"

(1 Kings 22:29) 
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.

(1 Kings 22:30) 
The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself before I enter the battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

(1 Kings 22:31) 
The king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except for the king of Israel alone."

(1 Kings 22:32) 
So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they assumed he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out.

(1 Kings 22:33) 
The chariot commanders realized that he was not the king of Israel, so they turned away from pursuing him.

(1 Kings 22:34) 
But a certain man drew his bow at random, without aiming, and struck the king of Israel between his lung and his stomach. The king said to his chariot driver, "Turn your hand, and take me out of the battle line, because I am severely wounded."

(1 Kings 22:35) 
The battle intensified throughout that day. The king of Israel remained propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died in the evening, and the blood from his wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.

(1 Kings 22:36) 
At sunset, a proclamation was made throughout the entire army, saying, "Every man return to his city, and every man to his own land!"

(1 Kings 22:37) 
So the king died, and he was brought to Samaria. They buried the king in Samaria.

(1 Kings 22:38) 
When they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots bathed in that very water—just as the Lord had prophesied would happen.

(1 Kings 22:39) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory palace he built, and all the works he accomplished, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(1 Kings 22:40) 
So Ahab slept with his fathers—meaning he died—and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.

(1 Kings 22:1) 
And three years passed without any war between the kingdom of Syria and the kingdom of Israel.

(1 Kings 22:2) 
Then, in the third year, Josaphat, who was the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.

(1 Kings 22:3) 
Now, the king of Israel spoke to his servants, saying: "Do you not know that the city of Ramoth Galaad belongs to us? Yet we remain silent, doing nothing to prevent it from being taken from our hands!"

(1 Kings 22:4) 
And the king of Israel then asked Josaphat: "Will you come with me to fight in battle against Ramoth Galaad?"

(1 Kings 22:5) 
Josaphat replied to the king of Israel: "I am with you as if I were you. My people are with you as if they were your people, and my horses are with you as if they were your horses—we are united as one." This was Josaphat's promise of military alliance.

(1 Kings 22:6) 
Josaphat then said to the king of Israel: "Please, I beg you, let us inquire today for a word from the Lord."

(1 Kings 22:7) 
So the king of Israel gathered about four hundred of his own prophets and asked them: "Should I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or should I hold back?" They all answered him: "Go up into battle! The Lord will give the city into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:8) 
But Josaphat asked: "Is there no other true prophet of the Lord here through whom we can inquire further?"

(1 Kings 22:9) 
The king of Israel replied to Josaphat: "There is one more man by whom we could inquire of the Lord, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. His name is Michæas, the son of Jemla." Josaphat responded, saying: "The king should not speak like that!"

(1 Kings 22:10) 
So the king of Israel called one of his eunuchs and ordered him: "Hurry and bring Michæas, the son of Jemla, here!"

(1 Kings 22:11) 
Now the king of Israel and Josaphat, the king of Judah, were sitting, each on his own throne. They were dressed in their royal robes in the open area near the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them, delivering their messages.

(1 Kings 22:12) 
Indeed, Sedecias, the son of Chanana, had made himself horns of iron and declared: "This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will push Syria until you completely destroy them."

(1 Kings 22:13) 
And all the other prophets prophesied similarly, saying: "Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and you will be successful! The Lord will give it into the king's hand."

(1 Kings 22:14) 
But the messenger who had gone to summon Michæas spoke to him, saying: "Look, the words of the prophets are all proclaiming good things to the king with one voice. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."

(1 Kings 22:15) 
Michæas responded to the messenger: "As the Lord lives, I will speak only whatever the Lord tells me."

(1 Kings 22:16) 
So when he came before the king, the king asked him: "Michæas, should we go to Ramoth Galaad to wage war, or should we hold back?"

(1 Kings 22:17) 
Michæas answered him, speaking sarcastically: "Go up, and you will be successful! The Lord will give it into the king's hand!"

(1 Kings 22:18) 
The king then said: "How many times must I warn you and adjure you under oath, that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"

(1 Kings 22:19) 
Michæas replied: "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: 'These people have no master. Let each one return to his own home in peace.'" This was a prophecy of the king's death.

(1 Kings 22:20) 
Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: "Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but always evil?"

(1 Kings 22:21) 
But Michæas continued, saying: "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left."

(1 Kings 22:22) 
And the Lord asked: 'Who will deceive Achab, the king of Israel, so that he will go up to Ramoth Galaad and fall there?' And one spirit spoke these words, and another spoke other words.

(1 Kings 22:23) 
Then a certain spirit came forth and stood before the Lord and said: 'I will deceive him.' The Lord asked him: 'How will you do it?'

(1 Kings 22:24) 
And the spirit said: 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' The Lord then said: 'You will deceive him, and you will prevail. Go out and do it in this manner.'

(1 Kings 22:25) 
Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has spoken evil concerning you.

(1 Kings 22:26) 
Then Sedecias, the son of Chanana, approached and struck Michæas on the cheek, saying: "By what way did the Spirit of the Lord depart from me to speak to you instead?"

(1 Kings 22:27) 
Michæas responded: "Behold, you will see on that day, when you go from chamber to inner chamber to hide yourself—fleeing from the battle."

(1 Kings 22:28) 
And the king of Israel commanded: "Take Michæas and lead him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joas, the son of Amelech."

(1 Kings 22:29) 
And say: 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of distress, until I return victorious and in peace.'"

(1 Kings 22:30) 
Michæas then declared: "If you indeed return victorious and in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added: "Hear this, all you peoples!"

(1 Kings 22:31) 
So the king of Israel and Josaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth Galaad.

(1 Kings 22:32) 
And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: "You, disguise yourself by putting on other clothes. But I will disguise myself in a different manner and then go into battle." So the king of Israel changed his royal attire and went into the war.

(1 Kings 22:33) 
Now the king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot captains, saying: "Do not fight against anyone, neither small nor great, except against the king of Israel alone."

(1 Kings 22:34) 
When the chariot captains saw Josaphat, they assumed and said: "This must be the king of Israel!" So they turned to attack him in battle, and Josaphat cried out for help.

(1 Kings 22:35) 
And the chariot captains realized that it was not the king of Israel, so they turned away from pursuing him.

(1 Kings 22:36) 
However, a certain man drew his bow and, shooting an arrow randomly, struck the king of Israel between the shoulder armor and the breastplate. The king then cried out to his chariot driver: "Turn around and take me out of this battle, because I have been seriously wounded!"

(1 Kings 22:37) 
And the battle raged fiercely throughout that day. The king of Israel remained standing in his chariot, facing the Syrians, until he died at evening. The blood from his wound flowed out onto the floor of the chariot.

(1 Kings 22:38) 
After his body was brought to Samaria, they buried the king in Samaria.

(1 Kings 22:39) 
His chariot was then washed in the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves there. This happened exactly according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His prophet Michæas.

(1 Kings 22:40) 
As for the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, including the ivory house he built and all the cities he constructed, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
