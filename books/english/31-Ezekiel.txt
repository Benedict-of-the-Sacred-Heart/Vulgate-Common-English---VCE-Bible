(Ezekiel 1:1) 
It happened in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month—reckoned from a significant historical event—while I was among the captives by the Chebar River, that the spiritual heavens were opened, and I began to see visions from God.

(Ezekiel 1:2) 
This same fifth day of the month also marked the fifth year of the exile of King Joachim.

(Ezekiel 1:3) 
The word of the Lord came directly to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, who was a priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the Chebar River. And at that moment, the powerful hand of the Lord came upon him, empowering him for this vision.

(Ezekiel 1:4) 
And as I looked, I saw a great whirlwind coming from the north. There was a massive cloud, with fire swirling within it, and brilliant light shone all around it. From the very center of this fire, there was something that gleamed like polished, glowing metal, shining from the heart of the flames.

(Ezekiel 1:5) 
And from the center of this shining fire, I saw the likeness of four living creatures emerge. This was their overall appearance: they had the form and likeness of human beings.

(Ezekiel 1:6) 
Each one of these creatures had four faces, and each one also had four wings.

(Ezekiel 1:7) 
Their legs were straight, terminating in feet whose soles were like the hoofs of a calf, perfectly rounded and gleaming. Their feet sparkled and shone like the appearance of burnished, glowing bronze.

(Ezekiel 1:8) 
Underneath their wings, on each of their four sides, there were human hands visible. Their faces and wings were arranged around their four sides.

(Ezekiel 1:9) 
Their wings were joined one to another, connecting them. As they moved, they did not turn around; instead, each creature advanced straight forward, in the direction of its primary face.

(Ezekiel 1:10) 
This was the likeness of their faces: Each of the four creatures had a human face in the front. On their right side, each had a lion's face. On their left side, each had an ox's face. And on the back (or above), each had an eagle's face.

(Ezekiel 1:11) 
Their faces were arranged in this manner, and their wings were spread out above them. Each creature had two wings joined together, and two other wings covered their bodies.

(Ezekiel 1:12) 
Each one moved straight forward, in the direction of its primary face. Wherever the impulse or leading of the Spirit was, that is where they went. They never turned back as they moved, maintaining a consistent direction.

(Ezekiel 1:13) 
The living creatures themselves had an appearance like burning coals of fire, blazing brightly. There was also the appearance of lamps, moving quickly among the creatures, casting light. There was the intense brightness of fire, and from this fire, flashes of lightning constantly came forth.

(Ezekiel 1:14) 
The living creatures themselves moved back and forth with incredible speed, appearing like sudden flashes of lightning.

(Ezekiel 1:15) 
As I continued to look at the living creatures, I saw a single wheel resting on the ground beside each of the creatures. This wheel also appeared to have four sides, or aspects, corresponding to the creature's orientation.

(Ezekiel 1:16) 
The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the shining, deep-blue color of the sea, or a sea-green gem. All four wheels had the same exact likeness. Their appearance and structure seemed to be like a wheel integrated within another wheel.

(Ezekiel 1:17) 
When the creatures and wheels moved, they could go in any of their four directions without turning. They did not have to pivot or reverse course as they advanced.

(Ezekiel 1:18) 
The rims of the wheels were exceedingly high, majestic, and awe-inspiring to behold. And these rims were completely full of eyes all around the circumference of all four wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:19) 
When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved alongside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were also lifted up with them, always in perfect unison.

(Ezekiel 1:20) 
Wherever the living spirit of the creatures desired to go, there the wheels and the creatures moved. And the wheels were lifted up alongside the spirit, because the same Spirit that animated the living creatures was also present and active within the wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:21) 
When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when they stood still, the wheels also stood still. And when the creatures were lifted from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, because the same animating Spirit of life was in the wheels.

(Ezekiel 1:22) 
Above the heads of the living creatures, there was an appearance of an expanse, or a firmament. It looked like dazzling, awe-inspiring crystal, spread out high above their heads.

(Ezekiel 1:23) 
Underneath this crystal-like expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one wing towards another. Each creature had two wings covering its body in humility and reverence, while the other two were extended outward.

(Ezekiel 1:24) 
I heard the sound of their wings as they moved, like the roar of mighty rushing waters. It was like the voice of Almighty God Himself speaking from on high. When they walked, the sound was like the clamor of a vast army. And when they stood still, their wings were lowered, becoming silent.

(Ezekiel 1:25) 
And a voice came from above the crystal-like expanse that was over their heads when they stopped moving and lowered their wings.

(Ezekiel 1:26) 
Above the expanse that was over their heads, there was something like a throne, appearing like a sapphire stone in its brilliant blue. And seated upon this throne, there was a figure that appeared in the likeness of a man.

(Ezekiel 1:27) 
I saw what appeared to be polished, glowing metal, with the appearance of fire all around within it. From what appeared to be his waist upwards, and from his waist downwards, I saw what looked like sparkling, vibrant fire, and a brilliant light surrounded him.

(Ezekiel 1:28) 
The brilliant light surrounding Him was like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This entire vision was the visionary appearance of the glory of the Lord Himself, a visible manifestation of His divine majesty. When I saw all this, I immediately fell on my face in reverence and awe, and then I heard a voice speaking to me.

(Ezekiel 2:1) 
And He said to me, "Son of man" (meaning, 'you, a human being'), "stand up. I will speak with you directly."

(Ezekiel 2:2) 
And the Spirit entered into me right after He had finished speaking, and the Spirit made me stand on my feet, allowing me to fully receive the message. And I heard Him speaking to me directly.

(Ezekiel 2:3) 
And He then said, "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel—to the rebellious generations of people who have turned away from me. Both they and their ancestors have rebelled against me, right up to this very day."

(Ezekiel 2:4) 
The people are stubborn-faced and hard-hearted. To these people I am sending you. You shall say to them: 'This is what the Lord God says.'

(Ezekiel 2:5) 
And whether they listen or choose to ignore you (because they are a rebellious nation), they will know that a prophet from God has been among them.

(Ezekiel 2:6) 
Therefore, son of man, do not fear them, and do not be afraid of what they say. For you are living among faithless and corrupt people—you are dwelling among what seem like scorpions to you. Do not fear their words, and do not be terrified by their faces, because they are a rebellious nation.

(Ezekiel 2:7) 
And you shall speak my words to them, whether they listen or choose to ignore you, because they are rebellious.

(Ezekiel 2:8) 
Therefore, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious nation. Open your mouth and eat whatever I give to you, meaning, 'fully internalize and accept my message'.

(Ezekiel 2:9) 
And I saw a hand reaching out to me, holding a scroll, like a book. The hand unrolled the scroll before me, and it was written on both the inside and the outside, indicating the complete fullness of its message. Written on it were messages of grief, a mournful song of judgment, and declarations of inevitable sorrow.

(Ezekiel 3:3:1) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, whatever you find, eat it. Eat this scroll, and then go and speak to the children of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:2) 
So I opened my mouth, and He fed me that scroll.

(Ezekiel 3:3:3) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, your stomach will digest this, and your innermost being will be filled with this scroll that I am giving you.” So I ate it, and in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey.

(Ezekiel 3:3:4) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, go now to the entire nation of Israel, and you will speak My words to them.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:5) 
For you are not being sent to a people whose language is too deep or unknown for you to understand, but to the nation of Israel.

(Ezekiel 3:3:6) 
Nor are you sent to many peoples with deep speech and unknown languages, whose words you could not comprehend. Indeed, if you were sent to them, they would actually listen to you.

(Ezekiel 3:3:7) 
However, the nation of Israel will not want to listen to you, because they do not want to listen to Me. For all the people of Israel are stubborn and hard-hearted, with untamed spirits.

(Ezekiel 3:3:8) 
Behold, I have made your face very strong against their faces, and your forehead very hard against their foreheads.

(Ezekiel 3:3:9) 
I have made your face like a diamond and like flint. Do not fear them, nor be afraid of their expressions, for they are a rebellious and provoking nation.

(Ezekiel 3:3:10) 
And He added and said to me: “Son of man, take all My words that I have spoken to you into your heart, and hear them with your ears.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:11) 
“And go, proceed to the exiles, to the children of your people. Speak to them, and tell them: ‘Thus says the Lord God.’ Perhaps they will listen, and then they will find peace and cease their rebellion.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:12) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rumbling: “Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place!”

(Ezekiel 3:3:13) 
This was the sound of the wings of the living creatures striking against one another, and the sound of the wheels following them, and a voice of great commotion.

(Ezekiel 3:3:14) 
The Spirit also lifted me up and took me away, and I went, bitter and indignant in my spirit. For the hand of the Lord was strengthening me, even through my emotions.

(Ezekiel 3:3:15) 
And I came to the exiles in Tel-abib (the settlement by the 'mound of fresh produce'), to those who lived by the Chebar River. I sat there for seven days, mourning in their midst.

(Ezekiel 3:3:16) 
And when seven days had passed, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 3:3:17) 
“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the nation of Israel. You will hear a word from My mouth, and you will declare it to them on My behalf.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:18) 
“If I say to a wicked person: ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn him, nor speak to turn that wicked person from his wicked way so that he may live, that very wicked person will die in his iniquity. But I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:19) 
“But if you do warn the wicked person, and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, he indeed will die in his iniquity. But you will have delivered your own soul.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:20) 
“But also if a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place a stumbling block before him: this one will die in his sin. His righteous deeds which he had done will not be remembered. And even if you *should* warn him, he will die in his own sin, and I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:21) 
“But if you do warn a righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, and you will have delivered your own soul.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:22) 
And the hand of the Lord came upon me there, and He said to me: “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I will speak with you.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:23) 
So I arose and went out into the plain. And behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, just like the glory I had seen by the Chebar River. And I fell on my face in reverence.

(Ezekiel 3:3:24) 
Then the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet. And He spoke to me and said: “Go in, and shut your door within your house.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:25) 
“And as for you, Son of man, behold, they (the people of Israel) have figuratively bound you with cords, and they will keep you bound by them. You will not be able to go out among them to speak freely.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:26) 
“And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so you will be silent. You will not be a man constantly reproving, because they are a rebellious and provoking nation.”

(Ezekiel 3:3:27) 
“But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Let him who hears, hear. And let him who refuses to listen, remain unyielding,’ for they are a rebellious and provoking nation.”

(Ezekiel 4:1) 
You, son of man, take a clay brick, place it before you, and engrave a drawing of the city of Jerusalem on it.

(Ezekiel 4:2) 
Then, depict a siege around it: build siege works, construct a siege ramp, set up enemy camps, and position battering rams all around it.

(Ezekiel 4:3) 
Now, take an iron griddle and place it between yourself and the city, as if it were an iron wall. Set your face resolutely against the city, indicating the severity of the siege. This action shows a siege being laid against it, and this entire representation is a symbolic sign for the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 4:4) 
Then, you must lie on your left side and bear the sins of the house of Israel upon yourself. You will carry their sin for as many days as you lie in this position.

(Ezekiel 4:5) 
For I have appointed to you a period of 390 days, each day representing a year of their rebellion. During this time, you will symbolically bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 4:6) 
When those days are completed, you are to lie on your right side and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah for 40 days. Again, I have appointed each day to represent a year of their sin.

(Ezekiel 4:7) 
During this time, you will keep your face fixed on the representation of the siege of Jerusalem. Your arm will be bared, ready for action, as you prophesy against the city.

(Ezekiel 4:8) 
Listen, I have bound you with cords so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the full number of days for your symbolic siege.

(Ezekiel 4:9) 
Now, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Mix all these grains into a single vessel and use them to bake bread for yourself. You will eat this bread for the 390 days you are lying on your side, fulfilling your symbolic act.

(Ezekiel 4:10) 
The food you eat will be strictly rationed: twenty shekels by weight each day. You must eat this small amount at specific intervals throughout the day, ensuring it lasts.

(Ezekiel 4:11) 
And you will drink water by measure as well: a sixth of a hin each day. You will drink this small amount at specific intervals, just like your food.

(Ezekiel 4:12) 
You will eat this bread, coarse and unappetizing like barley cakes, and in their presence, you must bake it using human waste as fuel. This will be a shocking sign of extreme defilement.

(Ezekiel 4:13) 
The Lord declared: 'In this very manner, the children of Israel will eat their bread, defiled and unclean, among the pagan nations to which I will drive them into exile.'

(Ezekiel 4:14) 
Then I cried out, 'Oh no, Lord God! My soul has never been defiled by such things. I have never eaten anything that died a natural death or was torn by wild animals, nor has any unclean meat entered my mouth since my childhood!'

(Ezekiel 4:15) 
And He said to me, 'Very well, I grant your request. Look, I will allow you to use cow dung instead of human waste. You may now prepare your bread using that as fuel.'

(Ezekiel 4:16) 
Then He said to me, 'Son of man, listen! I am about to cut off Jerusalem's food supply, effectively breaking its staff of bread. They will eat their bread in carefully weighed portions, consumed with great anxiety, and drink their water by exact measure, filled with distress.'

(Ezekiel 4:17) 
This severe rationing is so that their supply of bread and water will utterly fail. They will mourn and lament to one another in their suffering, and they will waste away because of their sins.

(Ezekiel 5:1) 
And you, son of man, take a sharp razor—one for shaving hair and beard. Then take weighing scales and divide the hairs you have shaved off.

(Ezekiel 5:2) 
You shall burn a third of these hairs in the middle of the city—Jerusalem—in the time of the siege. Then, take another third and strike it with a sword all around the city. And the last third you shall scatter to the wind, but I will draw a sword and pursue those who scatter.

(Ezekiel 5:3) 
Yet, from these scattered hairs, take a very small number, and bind them into the folds of your cloak.

(Ezekiel 5:4) 
But even from these few hairs you just bound, you must again take some, throw them into the fire, and burn them with fire. From that burning, fire will spread to consume the whole house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 5:5) 
Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem. I placed her in the center of the nations, with many lands surrounding her.

(Ezekiel 5:6) 
But she has despised My laws in her wickedness even more than the nations did. She did not keep My commandments, nor did she even follow the laws of the nations surrounding her, much less My own commandments. This is because she utterly rejected My laws.

(Ezekiel 5:7) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have acted with more wickedness than the nations around you, and have not walked in My commandments, nor have you kept My laws, nor have you even lived according to the laws of the nations around you—

(Ezekiel 5:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am coming against you, and I will execute My judgments in your midst, for all the nations to see.

(Ezekiel 5:9) 
And I will do to you what I have never done before, and what I will never do again, because of all your abominable practices.

(Ezekiel 5:10) 
Therefore, fathers will eat their children in your midst, and children will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter all your remaining survivors to every wind.

(Ezekiel 5:11) 
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, because you have defiled My holy temple with all your idols and with all your detestable practices, I also will cut you off. My eye will not show pity, and I will have no mercy on you.

(Ezekiel 5:12) 
A third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine in your midst. Another third will fall by the sword around you. And the last third I will scatter to every wind, and I will draw a sword and pursue them.

(Ezekiel 5:13) 
Thus, I will complete My furious judgment and make My indignation rest fully upon them. And I will be satisfied; then they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in My righteous zeal, when I have accomplished My indignation against them.

(Ezekiel 5:14) 
I will turn you into a desolate place and make you an object of disgrace among the nations surrounding you, in the full view of everyone who passes by.

(Ezekiel 5:15) 
So you will become a disgrace, a cause for scorn, a warning, and an object of horror to the nations around you, when I execute My judgments against you with fury, and with indignation, and with furious rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 5:16) 
Because I will send upon you the deadly arrows of famine, which will be for your destruction—indeed, I will send them upon you to utterly destroy you. I will intensify the famine among you, and I will break your very supply of bread.

(Ezekiel 5:17) 
And I will send upon you famine and deadly wild animals, and they will ravage you and cause you to perish. Disease and bloodshed will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 6:1) 
Then the word of the Lord came directly to me, His prophet, saying:

(Ezekiel 6:2) 
Son of Man, turn your attention towards the mountainous regions of Israel. Prophesy against them, and tell them:

(Ezekiel 6:3) 
You mountains of Israel, listen to the message of the Lord God! The Lord God says this to the mountains, the hills, the rocky outcrops, and the valleys: 'Behold, I am about to bring war upon you, and I will utterly destroy your pagan shrines and places of idol worship.'

(Ezekiel 6:4) 
I will demolish your pagan altars, and I will shatter your idol-statues. I will cast down the corpses of your slain worshippers right in front of your useless idols.

(Ezekiel 6:5) 
I will also spread the corpses of the children of Israel before your idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars, desecrating them.

(Ezekiel 6:6) 
In all the places where you live, your cities will become deserted ruins, and your pagan shrines will be torn down. Your idol-statues will be utterly shattered and broken to pieces, your detestable images will cease to exist, and all your evil works will be completely erased.

(Ezekiel 6:7) 
Many of your people will fall dead in your midst, and then you will truly know that I am the Lord, the one true God.

(Ezekiel 6:8) 
But I will allow some of your people to survive, preserving a remnant from the nation, even when you are scattered and dispersed throughout the various lands among foreign peoples.

(Ezekiel 6:9) 
And those who escape and flee from you into the foreign nations where they have been led captive, they will remember Me. They will remember how I broke their spiritually unfaithful heart, which had strayed far from Me, and their eyes, which lusted after their idols. They will detest themselves for all the evil things and abominations they have committed.

(Ezekiel 6:10) 
And they will then know for certain that I, the Lord, have not spoken idly or in vain, and that I have indeed brought all these calamities and evils upon them, exactly as I promised.

(Ezekiel 6:11) 
This is what the Lord God says: 'Strike your hand together in despair! Stamp your foot on the ground in mourning! And cry out, 'Alas, for the mountains of Israel!' For all the utterly evil abominations committed by the entire house of Israel, they are about to perish by war, by starvation, and by plague.

(Ezekiel 6:12) 
Those who are far away will die from plague. Those who are close by will fall in war. And those who survive and are trapped in besieged cities will die from starvation. In this way, I will completely unleash My furious wrath upon them.

(Ezekiel 6:13) 
Then you will know that I am truly the Lord, when your slain people lie dead among your idols, all around your pagan altars. This will happen on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every leafy tree, and under every dense oak tree—these are the very places where you offered sweet-smelling incense to all your detestable idols.

(Ezekiel 6:14) 
And I will stretch out My judging hand against them. I will turn their land into a desolate and uninhabitable wasteland, from the desert of Diblah across all the places where they dwell. And then they will know without a doubt that I am the Lord, the one true God.

(Ezekiel 7:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 7:2) 
“And you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: ‘The end has come, the end is coming upon all parts of the land.

(Ezekiel 7:3) 
Now the end is upon you. I will send My wrath upon you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all the consequences of your abominations upon you.

(Ezekiel 7:4) 
My eye will not spare you, nor will I have mercy. Instead, I will bring the consequences of your ways upon you, and your abominations will be made clear in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 7:5) 
This is what the Lord God says: ‘A single, unique disaster — behold, it comes!

(Ezekiel 7:6) 
The end has come, the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it comes!

(Ezekiel 7:7) 
The dawn of your judgment has come upon you, you who dwell in the land. The time has come; the day of slaughter is near, and there will be no joyful shouts on the mountains.

(Ezekiel 7:8) 
Now My day is near, that I may pour out My burning anger upon you and fulfill My fury in you. I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all the consequences of your abominations upon you.

(Ezekiel 7:9) 
My eye will not spare you, nor will I have mercy. Instead, I will bring the consequences of your ways upon you, and your abominations will be made clear in your midst. Then you will know that I am the Lord, who has struck you.’

(Ezekiel 7:10) 
Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! The dawn has arrived. The rod of punishment has blossomed, and pride has fully sprouted.

(Ezekiel 7:11) 
Violence has risen into a rod of wickedness. Nothing is left of them, neither of their crowd, nor of any part of them; there is no peace among them.

(Ezekiel 7:12) 
The time has come, the day has drawn near. Let him who buys not rejoice, and let him who sells not mourn, for wrath is upon all its people.

(Ezekiel 7:13) 
For the seller will not return to what was sold, even if he remains among the living, for their lives will not be strengthened. The vision of their future will not return to all their multitude, and no man will be made strong by the wickedness of his life.

(Ezekiel 7:14) 
Blow the trumpet, prepare everything! Yet no one goes forth to battle, because My wrath is upon all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 7:15) 
The sword is outside, and pestilence and famine are inside. Whoever is in the open country will die by the sword, and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will consume him.

(Ezekiel 7:16) 
And those who flee from them will be saved, but they will be on the mountains like trembling doves of the valleys, each one overwhelmed by his own iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:17) 
All hands will hang limp, and every knee will become weak as water.

(Ezekiel 7:18) 
And they will gird themselves with sackcloth; terror will cover them. Shame will be on every face, and all their heads will be shaved bald in mourning.

(Ezekiel 7:19) 
They will cast their silver into the streets, and their gold will be as refuse. Their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them on the day of the Lord’s wrath. They will not satisfy their souls, nor will they fill their bellies, because their wealth became a stumbling block for their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:20) 
They used their beautiful jewelry for pride, and they made from it images of their abominations and their idols. Therefore, I have given it to them as an unclean and defiled thing.

(Ezekiel 7:21) 
And I will give it into the hands of foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked of the land as prey, and they will defile it.

(Ezekiel 7:22) 
And I will turn My face away from them, and they will defile My secret, holy place (the Temple). Plunderers will come to them and defile it.

(Ezekiel 7:23) 
‘Make a chain, for the land is full of bloody violence, and the city is full of iniquity.

(Ezekiel 7:24) 
Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will make the pride of the powerful cease, and they will possess their sanctuaries.

(Ezekiel 7:25) 
Anguish will come upon them. They will seek peace, but there will be none.

(Ezekiel 7:26) 
Disturbance upon disturbance will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will seek a vision from the prophet, but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

(Ezekiel 7:27) 
The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with sorrow. The hands of the people of the land will be troubled and paralyzed. I will bring their ways back upon them, and I will judge them by their own judgments. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”

(Ezekiel 8:8:1) 
And it happened in the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month (that is, the sixth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, meaning 592 BC). I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, and the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there.

(Ezekiel 8:8:2) 
And I looked, and behold, I saw a figure like the appearance of fire. From what appeared to be its loins downward, there was fire. And from its loins upward, there was an appearance of brightness, like the shining vision of electrum (a gleaming, golden-silver alloy).

(Ezekiel 8:8:3) 
And a likeness of a hand was sent out and took hold of me by the hair of my head. And the Spirit lifted me between the earth and the sky (the atmosphere), and brought me to Jerusalem in a divine vision, to the inner gate that faced north. There, the idol of jealousy (a pagan image that provoked God's wrath) had been set up, stirring Him to rivalry.

(Ezekiel 8:8:4) 
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as in the vision I had seen in the plain.

(Ezekiel 8:8:5) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, lift your eyes toward the way of the North." And I lifted my eyes toward the way of the North, and behold, to the north of the altar gate, there was the idol of jealousy right at the entrance itself.

(Ezekiel 8:8:6) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, do you really see what these people are doing? The house of Israel is committing exceedingly great abominations here, so much so that I must withdraw far from My sanctuary. And turning again, you will see even greater abominations."

(Ezekiel 8:8:7) 
And He brought me to the door of the (inner) courtyard, and I looked, and behold, there was a single hole in the wall.

(Ezekiel 8:8:8) 
And He said to me, "Son of Man, dig through the wall." And when I had dug through the wall, behold, there was a single door.

(Ezekiel 8:8:9) 
And He said to me, "Enter, and see the most wicked abominations that these people are doing here."

(Ezekiel 8:8:10) 
So I entered and saw. And behold, every likeness of creeping things, and detestable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were depicted on the wall all around the entire room.

(Ezekiel 8:8:11) 
And seventy elders of the house of Israel were standing before them (the depicted idols), with Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, as a chief among them. Each man had a censer in his hand, and the cloud of ascending incense filled the room.

(Ezekiel 8:8:12) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness? Each one is in the secret chamber of his (idolatrous) wall, for they say, 'The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land.'"

(Ezekiel 8:8:13) 
And He said to me, "Turning again, you will yet see even greater abominations that these people are doing."

(Ezekiel 8:8:14) 
And He brought me through the door of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faced north. And behold, there were women sitting, weeping for Adonis (a pagan god whose death was lamented in fertility rites).

(Ezekiel 8:8:15) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man? Turning again, you will yet see abominations even greater than these."

(Ezekiel 8:8:16) 
And He brought me into the inner courtyard of the house of the Lord. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the vestibule (the porch leading into the temple) and the altar, there were about twenty-five men. They had their backs to the temple of the Lord (turning their backs on God's true worship), and their faces were toward the East, and they were worshiping the rising sun toward the East.

(Ezekiel 8:8:17) 
And He said to me, "Do you truly see, Son of Man? Is it a light thing for the house of Judah that they have committed these abominations here? For they have filled the land with iniquity, and they have turned again and again to provoke Me. And behold, they even put the branch (a symbol of pagan ritual) to their nostrils (in contempt or pagan veneration)."

(Ezekiel 8:8:18) 
Therefore, I Myself will deal with them in fury. My eye will not spare them, nor will I have pity. And when they cry to My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

(Ezekiel 9:9:1) 
And he cried out into my hearing with a loud voice, saying: "The time for the city's judgment has drawn near, and each man has an instrument of destruction in his hand."

(Ezekiel 9:9:2) 
And behold, six men were coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each of them had an instrument of destruction in his hand. There was also one man among them, clothed in linen, who had a writer's inkhorn at his waist. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.

(Ezekiel 9:9:3) 
And the Glory of the Lord of Israel, which had been above the cherubim, was taken up and moved to the threshold of the Temple. He then called the man who was clothed in linen, and who had the writer's inkhorn at his waist.

(Ezekiel 9:9:4) 
And the Lord said to him: "Go through the midst of the city, right through the heart of Jerusalem. Mark with the sign of the cross (the letter Tau) on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and mourning over all the abominations that are being committed in its midst."

(Ezekiel 9:9:5) 
And to the other six, He said, while I listened: "Go through the city and strike them down! Let your eye not spare anyone, and show no pity."

(Ezekiel 9:9:6) 
"Kill all the old men, young men, virgins, little children, and women until utter destruction. But anyone on whom you see the mark of the cross, do not kill him. And begin the slaughter at My sanctuary, the Temple." So they began with the elder men who were in front of the Temple.

(Ezekiel 9:9:7) 
And He said to them: "Defile the Temple, and fill its courtyards with the slain. Go forth now!" And they went forth and began to strike down those who were in the city.

(Ezekiel 9:9:8) 
And it came to pass, as they were striking them down, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face. I cried out and said: "Alas, alas, alas! O Lord God, will You then destroy all the remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath upon Jerusalem?"

(Ezekiel 9:9:9) 
And He said to me: "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of perversion. For they have said: 'The Lord has abandoned the land, and the Lord does not see what we do.'"

(Ezekiel 9:9:10) 
"Therefore, My eye will also not spare, nor will I have pity. I will bring their conduct and consequences directly upon their own heads."

(Ezekiel 9:9:11) 
And behold, the man who was clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn at his waist, reported back, saying: "I have done exactly as You commanded me."

(Ezekiel 10:1) 
And I looked, and behold, in the created expanse that was above the heads of the cherubim, something appeared to them that looked like a sapphire stone, resembling the appearance of a throne.

(Ezekiel 10:2) 
Then He spoke to the man who was clothed in linen, instructing him: “Go into the midst of the wheels that are beneath the cherubim. Fill your hand with burning coals that are between the cherubim, and then pour them over the city as judgment.” And the man entered in my sight.

(Ezekiel 10:3) 
Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the Temple as the man entered, and a thick cloud, signifying God's presence, filled the inner court.

(Ezekiel 10:4) 
And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub and moved to the threshold of the Temple. The Temple itself was filled with the cloud of God's presence, and the court was filled with the radiant splendor of the Lord's glory.

(Ezekiel 10:5) 
The sound of the cherubim's wings could be heard even as far as the outer court, a sound like the very voice of Almighty God speaking.

(Ezekiel 10:6) 
So when He had given the command to the man clothed in linen, saying: “Take fire from the midst, specifically from among the wheels of the cherubim,” the man then entered and stood beside one of the wheels.

(Ezekiel 10:7) 
Then a cherub reached out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was located between them. He took some of the fire and placed it into the hands of the man who was clothed in linen. The man received it and then went out.

(Ezekiel 10:8) 
And it was seen on the cherubim that there was what looked like a human hand under their wings.

(Ezekiel 10:9) 
And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels positioned beside the cherubim — one wheel next to each cherub. The appearance of these wheels was like the sparkling vision of a chrysolite stone.

(Ezekiel 10:10) 
All four wheels had the same integrated appearance, like a single divine chariot, as if one wheel were set within another.

(Ezekiel 10:11) 
When the wheels moved, they went in their four primary directions without needing to turn as they moved. Rather, wherever the first wheel was impulsed to go, the others followed, maintaining their orientation.

(Ezekiel 10:12) 
And their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the very wheels of all four of them, were completely full of eyes all around, signifying divine knowledge and omnipresence.

(Ezekiel 10:13) 
These are the same wheels which I had previously heard being called 'the whirling ones' — implying constant motion and intricate design.

(Ezekiel 10:14) 
And each cherub had four distinct faces: one face was the face of a cherub (which means it had the form of a winged bull); the second face was the face of a man; the third face was the face of a lion; and the fourth face was the face of an eagle.

(Ezekiel 10:15) 
And the cherubim themselves were then lifted up. For this was the very same type of living creature that I had seen earlier by the Chebar River.

(Ezekiel 10:16) 
And when the cherubim moved forward, the wheels also moved alongside them. When the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the earth, the wheels, in the same synchronized manner, did not change their relative position but ascended with them.

(Ezekiel 10:17) 
When the cherubim stood still, the wheels also stood still. When the cherubim ascended, the wheels ascended along with them simultaneously. This perfect coordination was because the spirit of life, a divine animating force, was in both the creatures and the wheels.

(Ezekiel 10:18) 
And the glory of the Lord, God's manifest presence, then moved out from the threshold of the Temple itself and came to rest upon the cherubim.

(Ezekiel 10:19) 
And the cherubim lifted their wings, and the wheels alongside them, and they were lifted up from the earth and departed. Then the entire manifestation of God's glory stood at the entrance of the eastern gate of the Lord's Temple, and the radiant glory of the God of Israel was positioned over them.

(Ezekiel 10:20) 
This was the very same living creature that I had seen beneath the glorious manifestation of the God of Israel by the Chebar River. And at that moment, I finally understood that these creatures were cherubim.

(Ezekiel 10:21) 
Each cherub had four faces, and each had four wings. And there was the appearance of human hands under their wings.

(Ezekiel 10:22) 
And the likeness of their faces was indeed the same faces that I had seen by the Chebar River. Their manner of moving and their very presence were unchanged. Each of them moved straight forward, according to the direction of its face.

(Ezekiel 11:1) 
Then God's Spirit lifted me up, and in this prophetic vision, carried me to the eastern gate of the Lord’s Temple, the one facing the rising sun. And there, at the entrance of the gate, were twenty-five men. Among them, I saw Jazania, the son of Azur, and Pheltya, the son of Banaiah; these were prominent leaders among the people.

(Ezekiel 11:2) 
And the Lord said to me: “Son of Man, these are the very men who plot evil and devise wicked schemes against this city, Jerusalem.”

(Ezekiel 11:3) 
They boast, saying: ‘Isn't it true that new houses are to be built soon? This city is like a protective cooking pot, and we are the choice meat, safe inside it!’

(Ezekiel 11:4) 
Therefore, Son of Man, prophesy against them! Declare God's judgment upon them!

(Ezekiel 11:5) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon me, and He commanded me: “Speak! This is what the Lord says: O house of Israel, indeed, these are the words you have spoken. And I know every secret thought of your hearts!”

(Ezekiel 11:6) 
“You have murdered many people in this city, filling its streets with the slain bodies of your victims.”

(Ezekiel 11:7) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The corpses of those you have murdered and left in the city — *they* are the 'meat' in the 'pot' (Jerusalem). And as for you, I will forcefully remove you from this city,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:8) 
“You have brought the sword of violence upon others, and now I will bring the sword of judgment upon you,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:9) 
“I will drive you out from the midst of Jerusalem, and I will hand you over to your enemies, and I will execute my divine judgments against you.”

(Ezekiel 11:10) 
“You will fall by the sword. I will carry out my judgment against you within the very borders of Israel, so that you will know with certainty that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 11:11) 
“Indeed, Jerusalem will not be a protective pot for you, nor will you be safe meat within it. I will execute judgment against you within the borders of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 11:12) 
“And then you will know that I am the Lord. For you have not lived according to My commands, nor have you performed My judgments. Instead, you have acted according to the wicked practices of the surrounding pagan nations.”

(Ezekiel 11:13) 
It happened that as I was prophesying, Pheltya, the son of Banaiah, suddenly died. Overwhelmed, I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice: “Oh, alas, alas, Lord God! Are You going to completely destroy the small remnant of Israel that remains?”

(Ezekiel 11:14) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 11:15) 
“Son of Man, your brothers, your own relatives, and the entire house of Israel who are in exile — these are the ones about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem arrogantly declared: ‘Stay far away from the Lord! This land has been given exclusively to *us* as our possession!’”

(Ezekiel 11:16) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Although I have sent them far away among the nations, and even though I have scattered them throughout various lands, I will nonetheless be a sacred dwelling for them — a little sanctuary, a place of holiness — in the very lands where they have been sent as exiles.”

(Ezekiel 11:17) 
“Therefore, speak to them and say: This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from among the peoples, and I will bring you together from the lands where I have scattered you, and I will restore to you the land of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 11:18) 
“And when they return to that land, they will remove all its detestable idols and all its abominable practices from it.”

(Ezekiel 11:19) 
“And I will give them a unified heart, and I will place a new spirit within their innermost beings. I will take away their heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, one that is responsive to Me.”

(Ezekiel 11:20) 
“I will do this so that they may live according to My commands, observe My judgments, and actually do them. In this way, they will truly be My people, and I will truly be their God.”

(Ezekiel 11:21) 
“But as for those whose hearts persist in following their detestable idols and abominable practices, I will bring their own sinful ways down upon their own heads,” declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 11:22) 
Then the cherubim lifted their wings, and the chariot wheels moved with them, and the majestic glory of the God of Israel was still above them.

(Ezekiel 11:23) 
And the glorious presence of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and then it stood above the mountain located to the east of the city — which is the Mount of Olives.

(Ezekiel 11:24) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up again and, in a vision from God's Spirit, brought me back to Chaldea, where the exiles lived. And after this, the vision I had seen was removed from me.

(Ezekiel 11:25) 
And I immediately spoke to the exiled people all the words of the Lord which He had revealed to me.

(Ezekiel 12:1) 
Then the Lord spoke to me directly.

(Ezekiel 12:2) 
Son of Man, you are living among a truly rebellious people. They have eyes to see what I am doing, but they refuse to see, and they have ears to hear my words, but they refuse to listen, because they are a rebellious people.

(Ezekiel 12:3) 
Therefore, Son of Man, gather your belongings as if preparing for exile. During the daytime, in their full sight, you are to leave your home and go to another place, as if going into exile. Perhaps by doing this, they will finally see and understand that they are a rebellious people.

(Ezekiel 12:4) 
Then, in their sight, you are to bring out your belongings, as if you are someone going into exile during the day. But then, as evening falls, you yourself are to go out, in their sight, just as a person goes into exile.

(Ezekiel 12:5) 
While they watch, dig a hole through the wall of your house, and go out through it.

(Ezekiel 12:6) 
Carry your belongings out on your shoulder in the dark, in their sight. You will go out into the night, and your face will be covered so you cannot see the land. I am making you a prophetic sign for the people of Israel.

(Ezekiel 12:7) 
So I did exactly as the Lord commanded me. During the day, I brought out my baggage as if I were going into exile. Then, as evening came, I used my hands to dig a hole through the wall of my house. In the dark, I went out, carrying my belongings on my shoulder, all in their full sight.

(Ezekiel 12:8) 
The next morning, the Lord spoke to me again.

(Ezekiel 12:9) 
Son of Man, didn't the rebellious people of Israel ask you, 'What are you doing?'

(Ezekiel 12:10) 
Tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: This prophetic action concerns Jerusalem and all the people of Israel who live within it.'

(Ezekiel 12:11) 
Say this: 'I, Ezekiel, am a sign to you. Just as I have acted, so it will happen to them: they will be led away into exile and captivity.'

(Ezekiel 12:12) 
The leader among them, the king, will carry his belongings on his shoulder and go out in the dark. He will dig a hole through the wall to bring his provisions out through it. His face will be covered, so he will not see the land with his own eyes.

(Ezekiel 12:13) 
I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my traps. I will lead him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans. Even though he will arrive there, he will not see that land with his own eyes, and there he will die.

(Ezekiel 12:14) 
And all who are around him, his personal guard, and all his troops, I will scatter to every direction of the wind. I will draw a sword and pursue them.

(Ezekiel 12:15) 
Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them across many lands.

(Ezekiel 12:16) 
But I will spare a few of them from death by sword, famine, and plague. These survivors will then confess all their wicked deeds among the nations where they are scattered. In doing so, they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 12:17) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Ezekiel 12:18) 
Son of Man, you must eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with shaking and deep anxiety.

(Ezekiel 12:19) 
Then you are to say to the people of the land: 'This is what the Lord God declares to those who live in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in utter desolation. This will happen so that the land becomes desolate, emptying itself of its many inhabitants, because of the wickedness of all who live there.'

(Ezekiel 12:20) 
All the inhabited cities will become desolate, and the land itself will turn into an uncultivated wilderness. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 12:21) 
Again, the Lord's word came to me:

(Ezekiel 12:22) 
Son of Man, what is this proverb that you have among you in the land of Israel, that says: 'The days drag on, and every prophetic vision turns out to be false'?

(Ezekiel 12:23) 
Therefore, tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: I will put an end to this proverb, and it will no longer be spoken in Israel. Instead, tell them: The day of fulfillment is drawing near, and so is the outcome of every prophetic vision.'

(Ezekiel 12:24) 
For there will no longer be any false visions or misleading divinations among the children of Israel.

(Ezekiel 12:25) 
For I am the Lord, and what I speak will come to pass. My word will be fulfilled, and there will be no further delay. Indeed, in your lifetime, you rebellious people, I will speak my word, and I will bring it to pass, declares the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 12:26) 
Once more, the Lord's word came to me:

(Ezekiel 12:27) 
Son of Man, listen to what the people of Israel are saying: 'The vision this man Ezekiel sees is for a distant future, and he prophesies about events far off in time!'

(Ezekiel 12:28) 
Therefore, tell them: 'This is what the Lord God declares: None of my words will be delayed any longer. Every word I have spoken will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God.'

(Ezekiel 13:1) 
God's message then came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 13:2) 
"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying right now. Prophesy and say to those who prophesy from their own thoughts and desires, not from God: 'Listen to the message of the Lord!'"

(Ezekiel 13:3) 
"Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow only their own thoughts and desires and see no true vision from God!"

(Ezekiel 13:4) 
"Your prophets, O Israel, are like scavenging foxes in empty ruins."

(Ezekiel 13:5) 
"You have not risen up to face the enemy, nor have you built a protective wall for the house of Israel, so that it might stand firm in battle on the day of the Lord's judgment."

(Ezekiel 13:6) 
"They have seen false visions and divined lies, claiming, 'Thus says the Lord,' when the Lord had not sent them. Yet they persisted in trying to make their own deceptive words come true."

(Ezekiel 13:7) 
"Have you not seen false visions and spoken lying divinations, saying, 'Thus says the Lord,' when I myself have not spoken to you?"

(Ezekiel 13:8) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have spoken falsehoods and seen lying visions, behold, I am against you, says the Lord God."

(Ezekiel 13:9) 
"My hand will be upon the prophets who see false visions and divine lies. They will not be included in the assembly of My people, nor will their names be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, and they will not enter the promised land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God."

(Ezekiel 13:10) 
"This is because they have deceived My people, constantly proclaiming, 'Peace!' when there is no true peace. And when the people attempt to build a weak wall for protection, these prophets plaster it over with flimsy mortar that has no straw, making it even weaker."

(Ezekiel 13:11) 
"Tell those who plaster with flimsy mortar that their wall will collapse! For I will send a torrential downpour, and I will unleash great hailstones from above, and a violent, scattering storm wind."

(Ezekiel 13:12) 
"When the wall collapses, will people not then ask you, 'Where is the shoddy plaster you used?'"

(Ezekiel 13:13) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will pour out My wrath like a torrential flood, and My fury will bring forth hailstones that consume everything, and a destructive storm wind."

(Ezekiel 13:14) 
"I will tear down the wall you plastered with flimsy mortar, bringing it crashing to the ground. Its very foundation will be exposed, and when it falls, you yourselves will be crushed in its rubble. Then you will know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 13:15) 
"I will completely spend My wrath upon the wall and upon those who plastered it with flimsy mortar. Then I will declare to you: 'There is no wall left, and there are no plasterers either!'"

(Ezekiel 13:16) 
"These are the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, who see visions of peace for her when, in fact, there is no peace," says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 13:17) 
"And you, son of man, set your face against the women of your people who prophesy from their own thoughts and desires. Prophesy against them!"

(Ezekiel 13:18) 
"And say: 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to those who sew magic armbands for every wrist and make special head-coverings for people of every age, all in order to ensnare souls! They trap the souls of My people, while ensuring their own souls prosper."

(Ezekiel 13:19) 
"You have profaned My holy name before My people for a mere handful of barley and a few crumbs of bread. You put to death those souls who were not destined to die, and you promise life to those souls who were not destined to live, all by lying to My people who readily believe your falsehoods."

(Ezekiel 13:20) 
"Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your magic armbands with which you ensnare souls like flying birds! I will tear them from your arms and release the souls you have trapped, those souls meant to be free."

(Ezekiel 13:21) 
"I will also tear apart your special head-coverings and deliver My people from your power. They will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 13:22) 
"This is because you have falsely made the heart of the righteous sad, those whom I Myself had not intended to grieve. And you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, encouraging them not to turn back from their evil ways and repent to live."

(Ezekiel 13:23) 
"Therefore, you will no longer see false visions or practice divination in the future. I will rescue My people from your power. Then you will truly know that I am the Lord."

(Ezekiel 14:1) 
And then, men from the elders of Israel came to me, and they sat down before me.

(Ezekiel 14:2) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 14:3) 
Son of man, these men have cherished their idols deep within their hearts, and they have placed the stumbling block of their sins directly before themselves. So, when they come to inquire of Me, should I even answer them?

(Ezekiel 14:4) 
Therefore, speak to them, and tell them: 'This is what the Lord God says: Any man, any man from the house of Israel, who cherishes his idols in his heart, and places the stumbling block of his sins directly before himself, and then comes to a prophet to inquire of Me—I, the Lord, will answer him, but My answer will be a judgment fitting the multitude of his idols.'

(Ezekiel 14:5) 
I will do this to catch the house of Israel by their own hearts, for they have all strayed far from Me because of their idols.

(Ezekiel 14:6) 
Therefore, say to the house of Israel: 'This is what the Lord God says: Repent and turn away from your idols! Turn your faces away from all your detestable practices!'

(Ezekiel 14:7) 
For every man from the house of Israel, and even any foreigner who lives among you, if he separates himself from Me and cherishes his idols in his heart, and places the stumbling block of his sins directly before himself, and then comes to a prophet to inquire of Me—I, the Lord, will answer him directly by Myself.

(Ezekiel 14:8) 
And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him an example and a warning. I will cut him off from the midst of My people, and then you shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 14:9) 
And if a prophet is deceived and speaks a false word, it is because I, the Lord, have allowed that prophet to be led astray, as a judgment upon the inquirer. And I will stretch out My hand against that prophet and destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.

(Ezekiel 14:10) 
So they will bear their guilt. The guilt of the prophet will be the same as the guilt of the one who inquired of him, because both were in sin.

(Ezekiel 14:11) 
This is so that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, and no longer defile themselves with all their sins. Instead, they shall be My people, and I will be their God, says the Lord of hosts.

(Ezekiel 14:12) 
And the word of the Lord came to me again, saying:

(Ezekiel 14:13) 
Son of man, when a land sins against Me by breaking My commandments and committing a serious trespass, I will stretch out My hand against it. I will break its supply of food, bringing famine upon it, and I will cut off from it both man and beast.

(Ezekiel 14:14) 
Even if these three righteous men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the midst of that land, they would only deliver their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord of hosts.

(Ezekiel 14:15) 
If I bring savage beasts upon that land to devastate it, and it becomes so desolate that no one can pass through because of the wild animals,

(Ezekiel 14:16) 
even if these three men were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither sons nor daughters. Only they themselves would be delivered, but the land would be utterly laid waste.

(Ezekiel 14:17) 
Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and command it, saying: 'Sword, sweep through the land!'—and I cut off from it both man and beast,

(Ezekiel 14:18) 
even if these three men were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.

(Ezekiel 14:19) 
Or if I send a devastating plague upon that land, and pour out My fury upon it with bloodshed, cutting off from it both man and beast,

(Ezekiel 14:20) 
even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst—as I live, says the Lord God—they would save neither son nor daughter. Only they themselves, by their righteousness, would deliver their own souls.

(Ezekiel 14:21) 
For this is what the Lord God says: 'How much worse will it be when I send My four most severe judgments—the sword, and the famine, and the savage beasts, and the plague—upon Jerusalem, to cut off from it both man and beast?'

(Ezekiel 14:22) 
Yet, a remnant will be saved in it—sons and daughters who will be brought out from Jerusalem. Behold, they will come out to you, and you will see their wicked ways and their evil deeds. Then you will find comfort concerning the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem, concerning all that I have brought upon it.

(Ezekiel 14:23) 
You will be comforted when you see their ways and their deeds, and you will know that I did not bring all of this upon Jerusalem for no reason, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 15:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 15:2) 
“Son of man, what is the wood of a vine worth compared to all other trees of the forest? What is a branch from a vine among the trees of the groves? The Lord asks this to highlight its lack of inherent value.

(Ezekiel 15:3) 
Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can a peg be taken from it to hang any vessel upon it? The answer is no, because vine wood is weak and unsuitable for construction or support.

(Ezekiel 15:4) 
Look, it is given to the fire as fuel. The fire consumes both of its ends, and its middle is scorched. Will any of it be useful for work then? No, it only serves to burn.

(Ezekiel 15:5) 
Even when it was whole and unburnt, it wasn't suitable for any work. How much less will anything useful be made from it after the fire has consumed it and it has been scorched? Nothing at all.

(Ezekiel 15:6) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Just as the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest is given to the fire as fuel, so will I hand over the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They are like useless vine wood, destined for destruction due to their unfruitfulness.

(Ezekiel 15:7) 
And I will set my face against them, meaning my judgment will be upon them. Though they have escaped some previous judgment or disaster, another fire will consume them completely. And you will know that I am the Lord when I have set my face against them in judgment.

(Ezekiel 15:8) 
And I will make their land an impassable and desolate wilderness, because they have been unfaithful and rebellious against my covenant,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:1) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 16:2) 
“Son of man, show Jerusalem its detestable actions,

(Ezekiel 16:3) 
and say, ‘These are the words of the Lord God to Jerusalem: “Your origins and your family come from the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.”

(Ezekiel 16:4) 
“At the time of your birth, on the day you were born, your umbilical cord wasn't cut, and you weren't washed clean with water to make you healthy, nor were you salted to cleanse you, nor were you wrapped in cloths.

(Ezekiel 16:5) 
“No one looked upon you with pity, to do any of these things for you. No one had mercy on you. Instead, you were thrown out in a field on the day you were born, despised because you were a child.

(Ezekiel 16:6) 
“As I passed by you, I saw you trampled in your own blood. And I said to you, ‘Live!’ I said to you, ‘Live!’

(Ezekiel 16:7) 
“I caused you to grow like a plant of the field. You grew and became great. You attained the beauty of a woman, and your breasts developed, and your hair grew. But you were naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:8) 
“Then I passed by you again and saw that it was the time of love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness, and I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord God. “And so you became mine.

(Ezekiel 16:9) 
“Then I washed you with water and washed away your blood. I anointed you with oil.

(Ezekiel 16:10) 
“I clothed you with embroidered cloth, and I put sandals of fine leather on your feet, and I wrapped you in fine linen.

(Ezekiel 16:11) 
“I adorned you with jewelry and put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck.

(Ezekiel 16:12) 
“I put a ring in your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.

(Ezekiel 16:13) 
“You were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful, and you advanced to the position of queen.

(Ezekiel 16:14) 
“Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty. It was perfect because of my splendor that I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:15) 
“But you were confident in your beauty, and you played the prostitute because of your fame. You poured out your prostitution on every passerby, and you gave yourself to them.

(Ezekiel 16:16) 
“You took your jewelry of gold and silver, which I had given you, and made male images and committed prostitution with them.

(Ezekiel 16:17) 
“You took the clothing I had given you and covered them with it. You set my oil and my incense before them.

(Ezekiel 16:18) 
“And you set before them the bread I gave you, the fine flour, oil, and honey that I fed you, as a soothing fragrance. It happened,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:19) 
“You took your sons and daughters, whom you had borne to me, and sacrificed them to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution too little?

(Ezekiel 16:20) 
“You slaughtered my sons and gave them to them, consecrating them, giving them over to them.

(Ezekiel 16:21) 
“In all your acts of prostitution, you didn’t remember your days as a child, when you were naked and rolling in your own blood.

(Ezekiel 16:22) 
“After all your abominations and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and ashamed, rolling in your blood.

(Ezekiel 16:23) 
“And it happened, after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you!), says the Lord God,

(Ezekiel 16:24) 
“that you built yourself a brothel and made yourself a high place in every street.

(Ezekiel 16:25) 
“At every crossroads, you built a head, and you defiled your beauty and spread your legs to every passerby, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.

(Ezekiel 16:26) 
“You committed prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors, whose bodies were large, and you multiplied your prostitution, provoking me.

(Ezekiel 16:27) 
“Therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against you and reduce your allowance. I will give you over to the will of your daughters, who hate you. I will take you away.

(Ezekiel 16:28) 
“And I will hand you over to them, and they will tear down your brothel and destroy your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take away your jewelry, and they will leave you naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:29) 
“I will expose your nakedness and your prostitution and your foolishness. I will bring you down in disgrace and hand you over to them.

(Ezekiel 16:30) 
“I will do these things to you because you have committed prostitution with the nations and have defiled yourself with their idols.

(Ezekiel 16:31) 
“You have walked in the way of your sister, and I will put her cup into your hand.”

(Ezekiel 16:32) 
“You drank the cup of your sister, which was deep and wide. And you became an object of laughter and mockery, unable to hold yourself back.

(Ezekiel 16:33) 
“You were filled with drunkenness and sorrow. It is the cup of your brother that was given to you by the Lord.

(Ezekiel 16:34) 
“You will drink from it and drain it. You will crush the fragments, and you will break your breasts, because you have forgotten me,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 16:35) 
“Therefore, I have also given you into the hands of those you hated, because you despised me.

(Ezekiel 16:36) 
“When they come to you, and take you, they will do all their works on you and take away your sons and daughters, and they will kill you with the sword, and leave you famous, and they will carry out your acts of prostitution on you.

(Ezekiel 16:37) 
“And I will judge you according to the judgments of adulteresses and will pour out your blood in fury and zeal.

(Ezekiel 16:38) 
“And I will hand you over to them, and they will tear down your brothel and demolish your high places. They will strip you of your clothes and take away your jewelry, and they will leave you naked and ashamed.

(Ezekiel 16:39) 
“And they will do these things to you in hatred and with the zeal of fury, and they will take you away and leave you naked in the wilderness.

(Ezekiel 16:40) 
“They will bring up a crowd against you, and they will stone you and crush you, and they will kill you with their swords.

(Ezekiel 16:41) 
“They will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women, and I will cause you to cease your prostitution, and you will no longer give gifts.

(Ezekiel 16:42) 
“Then I will satisfy my wrath against you, and my jealousy will depart from you, and I will be at rest, and I will no longer be angry.

(Ezekiel 16:43) 
“Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me in all things, therefore, behold, I, even I, will repay your way upon your head,” says the Lord God, “because you have not committed wickedness above all your abominations.

(Ezekiel 16:44) 
“Behold, everyone who utters a proverb will utter it about you, saying, ‘Like mother, like daughter.’”

(Ezekiel 16:45) 
“You are the daughter of your mother, who abandoned her husband and her sons, and you are the sister of your brothers, who abandoned their husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

(Ezekiel 16:46) 
“Your elder sister is Samaria, who lives with her daughters to your left, and your younger sister, who lives to your right, is Sodom and her daughters.

(Ezekiel 16:47) 
“You did not walk in their ways, nor did you do according to their abominations, but it was as if that were too little for you, but you have corrupted more than them in all your ways.

(Ezekiel 16:48) 
“As I live,” says the Lord God, “your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done what you and your daughters have done.

(Ezekiel 16:49) 
“For this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and idleness were in her and in her daughters, and they did not support the hand of the poor and the needy.

(Ezekiel 16:50) 
“They were haughty and committed abominations before me. So I took them away, as you have seen.

(Ezekiel 16:51) 
“And Samaria has not committed even half of your sins. You have multiplied your abominations more than they did, and you have justified your sisters in all your abominations that you have done.

(Ezekiel 16:52) 
“Therefore, bear your shame, since you have judged your sisters. In your sins, which you spared them, they are more righteous than you.

(Ezekiel 16:53) 
“But you also bear your shame, since you have judged your sisters. In your sins, which you spared them, they are more righteous than you, so that you may justify your sisters when you have sinned, and you will be in disgrace, since you have borne them.”

(Ezekiel 16:54) 
“Therefore, turn back, and bear your shame for justifying your sisters.

(Ezekiel 16:55) 
“And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state.

(Ezekiel 16:56) 
“And your sister Sodom did not even speak in your mouth on the day of your pride,

(Ezekiel 16:57) 
before your wickedness was revealed, as in the time of the insults of the daughters of Syria, and all those who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who surrounded you all around.

(Ezekiel 16:58) 
“You have borne your prostitution and your abominations,” says the Lord.

(Ezekiel 16:59) 
“For these are the words of the Lord God: ‘I will deal with you as you have done, since you have despised the oath and broken the covenant.

(Ezekiel 16:60) 
“‘Yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an eternal covenant with you.

(Ezekiel 16:61) 
“‘Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both older and younger, and I will give them to you as daughters, but not as a covenant with you.

(Ezekiel 16:62) 
“‘And I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord,

(Ezekiel 16:63) 
so that you will remember and be ashamed and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all you have done,’” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 17:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 17:2) 
“Son of man, speak a riddle, and tell a parable to the house of Israel,

(Ezekiel 17:3) 
And say, 'The Lord God says this: A great eagle with great wings, a long flight, full of feathers and varied colors, came to Lebanon, and took a cedar:

(Ezekiel 17:4) 
He broke off the top of its branches, and brought it to the land of Canaan, and placed it in the city of merchants.'

(Ezekiel 17:5) 
He took from the seed of the land, and put it in a land of iniquity, and placed it like a willow by the waters.

(Ezekiel 17:6) 
And it sprouted, and grew into a vine of low stature, and its roots turned towards it, and it sent out its branches toward it.

(Ezekiel 17:7) 
There was therefore a great eagle, having large wings, and many hairs, and full of feathers, which came from Lebanon: and took the cedar.

(Ezekiel 17:8) 
He placed it in a good vine near many waters, to make branches, and bear fruit, and to be a noble vine.

(Ezekiel 17:9) 
Say, 'The Lord God says this: Will it then prosper? Will he not uproot its roots, and take away its fruit, and wither it? All the buds of its germination will wither, and not with great strength, nor with a multitude of people, to uproot it by the roots.

(Ezekiel 17:10) 
Behold, it is planted: will it prosper? Will it not, when the scorching wind touches it, utterly wither, and in the fields of its germination wither?'

(Ezekiel 17:11) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 17:12) 
Say to the house of iniquity: Do you not know what these things mean? Say: Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king and its princes, and brought them with him to Babylon.

(Ezekiel 17:13) 
And he took from the seed of the kingdom, and made a covenant with him, and received an oath from him, but he also removed the powerful of the land:

(Ezekiel 17:14) 
So that the kingdom would be humble, and would not exalt itself, but keep its covenant, and observe it.

(Ezekiel 17:15) 
Who departed from him, and sent his messengers to Egypt, to give him horses and much people: will he prosper, and escape who does these things? Will he who has broken the covenant escape?

(Ezekiel 17:16) 
As I live, says the Lord God, because in the place of the king who established him, he despised him, and broke his covenant, which he made with him: in the midst of Babylon he will die.

(Ezekiel 17:17) 
And not in a great army, nor in a large people, but he will die in war, and his remains will be scattered in every wind: and in this will not be his strength.

(Ezekiel 17:18) 
And he despised the oath, that he might break the covenant, and behold, he has given his hand, and done all these things: he will not escape.

(Ezekiel 17:19) 
Therefore, the Lord God says this: As I live, because my oath, which he despised, and my covenant, which he transgressed, I will put on his head.

(Ezekiel 17:20) 
And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my arrow: and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will judge him there for the iniquity by which he has transgressed against me.

(Ezekiel 17:21) 
And all his fugitives, with all his hand, will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered in every wind: and you will know that I the Lord have spoken.

(Ezekiel 17:22) 
The Lord God says this: And I will take from the top of the high cedar, and plant: from the top of its branches a tender one, and I will break, and I will plant it on a high and eminent mountain.

(Ezekiel 17:23) 
On the high mountain of Israel I will plant it: and it will make branches, and bear fruit, and it will be a magnificent cedar: and all the birds will dwell under it, every flying thing will nest under the shadow of its branches.

(Ezekiel 17:24) 
And all the trees of the region will know that I the Lord have humbled the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and I have dried up the green tree, and caused the dry tree to bear fruit. I the Lord have done it, and I will do it.

(Ezekiel 18:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, and said:

(Ezekiel 18:2) 
“Why do you keep using this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: ‘The parents ate sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are on edge’?

(Ezekiel 18:3) 
“As I live, says the Lord God, this proverb will no longer be used by you in Israel.

(Ezekiel 18:4) 
“Behold, all souls are Mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sins shall die.

(Ezekiel 18:5) 
“Now if a man is just, and does what is right:

(Ezekiel 18:6) 
“He doesn’t eat on the mountains, and doesn’t lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and doesn’t violate the wife of his neighbor, and doesn’t go to a menstruating woman:

(Ezekiel 18:7) 
“He doesn’t hurt any man, doesn’t take interest, and doesn’t take usury; he turns his hand from iniquity, and executes true judgment between man and man:

(Ezekiel 18:8) 
“He walks in My precepts, and keeps My judgments, to do what is true, he is just: he shall live, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 18:9) 
“But if he has begotten a son who is a robber, who sheds blood, and does any of these things:

(Ezekiel 18:10) 
“Who does any of these things, and does everything that his brother did not do, and who eats with these on the mountains, and violates the wife of his neighbor:

(Ezekiel 18:11) 
“He oppresses the poor and the needy, violently extorts plunder, does not restore the pledge, and lifts his eyes to idols, and commits abomination:

(Ezekiel 18:12) 
“He has given interest and taken usury: shall he live? He shall not live: since he has done all these things, he shall die; his blood shall be upon himself.

(Ezekiel 18:13) 
“But if he has begotten a son, who sees all the sins of his father that he has done, and does not do the like:

(Ezekiel 18:14) 
“Who does not eat on the mountains, and does not lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and does not violate the wife of his neighbor:

(Ezekiel 18:15) 
“He does not hurt any man, and does not take a pledge, and does not violently extort plunder, and gives his food to the hungry, and gives his bread to the poor:

(Ezekiel 18:16) 
“He turns his hand from iniquity, does not take interest and does not take usury: he does My judgments, and walks in My precepts: this one shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:17) 
“For the father died in his iniquity: but the son did judgment and justice, he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:18) 
“And you say: ‘Why does not the son bear the iniquity of his father?’ The son did judgment and justice: he has kept all My commandments, and done them: he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:19) 
“The soul that sins shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be with him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be with him.

(Ezekiel 18:20) 
“But if the wicked man does penance for all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My commandments, and does judgment and justice, he shall live: he shall not die.

(Ezekiel 18:21) 
“I will not remember all his iniquities that he has committed: in his justice which he has done, he shall live.

(Ezekiel 18:22) 
“Do I desire the death of the wicked, says the Lord God, and not that he be converted from his ways, and live?

(Ezekiel 18:23) 
“But if the just man turns away from his justice, and commits iniquity, according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? I will not remember all his justices that he has done: in the prevarication with which he has prevaricated, and in the sin with which he has sinned, in these shall he die.

(Ezekiel 18:24) 
“And you say: ‘The way of the Lord is not equitable.’ Hear now, house of Israel: is not My way equitable? Rather, your ways are not equitable.

(Ezekiel 18:25) 
“For when the just man turns away from his justice, and commits iniquity, he shall die in them: in the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die.

(Ezekiel 18:26) 
“And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed, and does judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive.

(Ezekiel 18:27) 
“Because he sees and withdraws from all his iniquities which he has committed, he shall live: he shall not die.

(Ezekiel 18:28) 
“And the house of Israel said: ‘The way of the Lord is not equitable.’ Are not My ways equitable, house of Israel? Rather, are not your ways wicked?

(Ezekiel 18:29) 
“Therefore I will judge you according to your ways, house of Israel, says the Lord God. Turn back and do penance from all your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be to you for ruin.

(Ezekiel 18:30) 
“Cast away from yourselves all your iniquities in which you have prevaricated, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: and why do you want to die, house of Israel?

(Ezekiel 18:31) 
“For I do not want the death of him who dies, says the Lord God: turn back, and live.

(Ezekiel 18:32) 
“Because I do not want the death of him that is dying, says the Lord God. Therefore be converted, and live.

(Ezekiel 19:1) 
You should begin a funeral song for the leaders of Israel.

(Ezekiel 19:2) 
Then say: What kind of mother was your leader, a lioness among other lions! She laid down among lions. She raised up her cubs among the lions.

(Ezekiel 19:3) 
One of her cubs became a lion, and learned to kill and devour humans.

(Ezekiel 19:4) 
The nations heard about him. He was caught in their trap. They led him in chains to the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 19:5) 
When his mother saw that her hopes were lost, she took another cub of hers and made him a lion.

(Ezekiel 19:6) 
This one lived among lions, learned to kill, and devoured humans.

(Ezekiel 19:7) 
He began to tear down cities and destroy the lands. The land and its people were laid waste by his roaring.

(Ezekiel 19:8) 
The nations around him gathered against him, and spread their net over him. He was caught in their trap.

(Ezekiel 19:9) 
They put him in a cage, in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon, so that his voice would never be heard again on the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 19:10) 
Your mother was like a vine, planted near the waters. She produced many shoots because she was by many waters.

(Ezekiel 19:11) 
Her strongest branches became the scepters of kings. Her height was exalted to the heavens, and she was raised up among her branches.

(Ezekiel 19:12) 
But she was cast down in anger. The land was trampled, and her fruit was carried away by the wind. Her branches withered and broke, and fire consumed them.

(Ezekiel 19:13) 
Now she is planted in the desert, in a land without water. Fire has come out of her branches and consumed her fruit. There is no strong branch left for a scepter of a kingdom.

(Ezekiel 19:14) 
This is a funeral song; it shall become a funeral song.

(Ezekiel 20:1) 
In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day, the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 20:2) 
“Son of man, direct your face toward Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:3) 
Speak, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of your rivers, that says: ‘My river is my own, and I have made myself.’

(Ezekiel 20:4) 
Because you said: ‘The river is mine, and I have made myself,’ therefore, I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers will stick to your scales.

(Ezekiel 20:5) 
And I will cast you into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall upon the face of the field, and you shall not be gathered, nor taken up. To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky, I have given you to be devoured.

(Ezekiel 20:6) 
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 20:7) 
When they took hold of you with the hand, you broke, and you tore all their shoulder: and when they leaned on you, you broke, and shattered all their loins.

(Ezekiel 20:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and I will cut off from you man and beast.

(Ezekiel 20:9) 
And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.

(Ezekiel 20:10) 
Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring the sword of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon upon Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:11) 
And the hand of him and the hand of his people with him, of the strong peoples: to destroy it.

(Ezekiel 20:12) 
And the swords of the mighty will I cause to fall, and I will crush the pride of Egypt: and I will destroy all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 20:13) 
And I will destroy all its beasts from the many waters: and it shall no longer be bold in the foot of man.

(Ezekiel 20:14) 
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, from the tower of Syene, even to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 20:15) 
And I will set fire in Egypt: it shall be greatly grieved, and dispersed, and shall fall by the sword.

(Ezekiel 20:16) 
Thus says the Lord God: And I will scatter Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and of the mighty peoples with him.

(Ezekiel 20:17) 
He and the people with him, the more powerful of the nations, to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

(Ezekiel 20:18) 
And I will make the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land desolate, and the fullness thereof by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it.

(Ezekiel 20:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will give Egypt to be desolate, desolate from the tower of Syene and to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 20:20) 
And I will give it into the hand of those who devastate it: and I will scatter it among the nations, and will disperse it throughout the countries.

(Ezekiel 20:21) 
And I will strengthen the hands of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groans of the slain.

(Ezekiel 20:22) 
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down: and I will put my sword in the hand of the king of Babylon.

(Ezekiel 20:23) 
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fail: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:24) 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them throughout the countries: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 20:25) 
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 20:26) 
“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.

(Ezekiel 20:27) 
Speak, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I bring you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, that says: ‘The river is mine, and I made it for myself.’

(Ezekiel 20:28) 
And I will put a hook in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales: and I will bring you out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.

(Ezekiel 20:29) 
And I will give you into the hand of them that devastate you, and they shall scatter you, and tread you down: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 20:30) 
Because you have said: ‘The river is mine, and I made it, and I made myself:’ therefore, I will deliver you into your rivers, and I will cast you with all the fish of your rivers: and I will bring you into the wilderness, into a land of desolation, and you shall not be built up anymore: because I the Lord have spoken it.

(Ezekiel 20:31) 
Thus says the Lord God: When I shall have gathered Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations: and they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 20:32) 
And they shall dwell in it with security, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell with confidence, when I shall have executed judgment in all who afflict them round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.

(Ezekiel 21:1) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:2) 
“Son of man, direct your face against Jerusalem, and look down upon the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

(Ezekiel 21:3) 
and say to the land of Israel: ‘Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw my sword from its sheath, and will cut off from you both the just and the wicked.’

(Ezekiel 21:4) 
Because I will cut off from you the just and the wicked, therefore will I draw my sword from its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north.

(Ezekiel 21:5) 
And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn my sword from its sheath, and it shall not return again.

(Ezekiel 21:6) 
You, therefore, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and in bitterness groan.

(Ezekiel 21:7) 
And when they say to you: ‘Why do you groan?’ say: ‘Because of what is to be heard: because it shall come; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be loosened, and every spirit shall be terrified, and all knees shall be weakened as water. Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord God.’

(Ezekiel 21:8) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:9) 
“Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord: Say: ‘A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished.’

(Ezekiel 21:10) 
It is sharpened that it may kill the victims. It is polished that it may cut and flash like lightning. I have given it to the slaughter.

(Ezekiel 21:11) 
And I have polished the sword that it may be held in the hand: against him who kills. So that his heart may be sad, and that ruin may be multiplied.

(Ezekiel 21:12) 
It is made ready to be polished, that it may kill. I have set it in the hand of the slayer.

(Ezekiel 21:13) 
Cry and howl, son of man: because it shall be in my people, and this shall be in all the princes of Israel, delivered to the sword with my people: therefore strike your thigh.

(Ezekiel 21:14) 
For there is a testing. And what if the sword despises? even the rod, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 21:15) 
You, therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hand, and say: ‘The sword, the sword is sharpened and brightened: it is sharpened to be butchered and polished for the great slaughter: that it may kill and crush them.’

(Ezekiel 21:16) 
So that the hearts of men may fear, and that ruin may be multiplied: I have set the sword in all their gates to bring confusion: alas! it is made to flash, and it is fitted for slaughter.

(Ezekiel 21:17) 
I have given the sword sharpened on both sides, that it may kill. Therefore, groaning, strike your hand.

(Ezekiel 21:18) 
And the Word of God came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 21:19) 
“You, therefore, son of man, mark out two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come from the land: both shall come out of the land: and I will set my hand, and I will set the way at the head of the way of the city.

(Ezekiel 21:20) 
I will set a way for the sword, and the sword shall come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah, and to Jerusalem.

(Ezekiel 21:21) 
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the ways, at the head of the two ways, divining: he has mixed arrows, he has consulted idols, he has consulted the liver.

(Ezekiel 21:22) 
In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to give a ram, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in shouting, to give a ram against the gates, to make a rampart, and to build a fortification.

(Ezekiel 21:23) 
And it shall be as a vain divination in their eyes, who have sworn to him: and he will remember iniquity that he may be taken.

(Ezekiel 21:24) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have made mention of your iniquity, and your transgression is revealed, and your sins have appeared in your thoughts, because you have been made mindful, and you are taken with a hand.’

(Ezekiel 21:25) 
“But you, impious and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come in the last time of iniquity,

(Ezekiel 21:26) 
thus says the Lord God: ‘Remove the turban, and take off the crown: this is not the same; exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.’

(Ezekiel 21:27) 
I will overturn, I will overturn, I will overturn it: and this shall be, until he comes to whom the judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.

(Ezekiel 21:28) 
“And you, son of man, prophesy and say: ‘Thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach: Say: A sword, a sword, is drawn to be butchered, sharpened to crush and to flash:

(Ezekiel 21:29) 
while they see you in vain, while they divine to you lies, that you may set yourself upon the necks of the impious who are slain, whose day has come in the last time of iniquity.’

(Ezekiel 21:30) 
Put it back into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you.

(Ezekiel 21:31) 
And I will pour out my indignation upon you: in the fire of my zeal I will melt you: and I will give you into the hand of cruel men, the craftsmen of wickedness, to be destroyed.

(Ezekiel 21:32) 
You shall be a fire for devouring: your blood shall be in the midst of the land: you shall not be remembered, because I the Lord have spoken.”

(Ezekiel 22:1) 
And the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:2) 
“Son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the city of bloodshed? You will reveal all its abominations to her.

(Ezekiel 22:3) 
And you will say: 'Thus says the Lord God: The city that pours out blood in her midst, so that her time may be accelerated, and makes idols against herself to defile her.

(Ezekiel 22:4) 
In your blood that you have poured out, you have become guilty. And in your idols that you have made, you have become defiled. And you have come close to your days, and have brought your years. Therefore, I have given you as a reproach to the nations and as a mockery to all lands.'

(Ezekiel 22:5) 
‘You are the object of reproach of those nearby, and a mockery to those around you. You will be a thing of name, full of confusion.

(Ezekiel 22:6) 
Behold, the princes of Israel, each one in his own arm, were in you to shed blood.

(Ezekiel 22:7) 
Father and mother they have despised in you. In your midst they have done calumny; the orphan and the widow they have afflicted in you.

(Ezekiel 22:8) 
My holy things they have despised, and my sabbaths they have polluted.

(Ezekiel 22:9) 
Men of detraction were in you to shed blood, and on the mountains they ate in you their wickedness.

(Ezekiel 22:10) 
The shame of the father they have uncovered in you, the uncleanness of the menstruating woman they have humiliated in you.

(Ezekiel 22:11) 
And each one’s abomination with the wife of his neighbor they have done in you, and in impurity a man has confused himself with his wife.

(Ezekiel 22:12) 
They poured out blood in you; they took interest and increase in you, and they have done calumny against your neighbors in you, but they have forgotten me, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 22:13) 
Behold, I have struck my hand against your greed that you have made, and against the blood that has been poured out in your midst.

(Ezekiel 22:14) 
Will your heart endure as in the days of evil? I have brought the sword upon you.

(Ezekiel 22:15) 
I will scatter you among the nations, and I will fan you in the lands, and I will take away from you your impurities.

(Ezekiel 22:16) 
And you will be defiled in yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 22:17) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:18) 
“Son of man, the house of Israel has become for me like the food of all: brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the midst of the furnace. Most impure silver has become for them.

(Ezekiel 22:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have become all like most impure silver, therefore behold, I will gather you in the midst of Jerusalem:

(Ezekiel 22:20) 
As silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin are accustomed to be gathered in the midst of the furnace, so that the fire may blow upon them to melt them: so I will gather you in my fury and in my indignation, and I will put you in the midst of it.

(Ezekiel 22:21) 
And I will gather you, and I will blow upon you the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.

(Ezekiel 22:22) 
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so will you be melted in the midst of it, and you will know that I am the Lord, because I have poured out my indignation upon you.”

(Ezekiel 22:23) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 22:24) 
“Son of man, say to her: ‘You are a land that is not watered, and rain has not fallen upon you in the day of indignation.

(Ezekiel 22:25) 
‘The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion seizing its prey: they have devoured souls; they have taken money and jewels. They have made widows in her numerous.

(Ezekiel 22:26) 
Her priests have despised my law, and have polluted my holy things. They have not separated between holy and profane, and they have not judged between what is polluted and what is clean, and from my sabbaths they have averted their eyes, and I have been profaned among them.

(Ezekiel 22:27) 
Her princes in her midst are like wolves seizing prey to shed blood and to destroy souls, so that they may make a profit from greed.

(Ezekiel 22:28) 
And her prophets covered for them, smearing for them without mortar, and saying: ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ seeing false visions and divining lies.

(Ezekiel 22:29) 
The people of the land have done calumny and have seized prey; they have afflicted the poor and the beggar, and they have oppressed the stranger against judgment.

(Ezekiel 22:30) 
And I sought among them a man who would repair the wall and stand in the breach against me for the land, so that I would not destroy it, but I did not find one.

(Ezekiel 22:31) 
And I poured out my indignation upon them; in the fire of my wrath I consumed them. I have given their work upon their head, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 23:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 23:2) 
Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.

(Ezekiel 23:3) 
And they committed fornication in Egypt. They committed fornication in their youth. There, their breasts were pressed, and there, the nipples of their virginity were broken.

(Ezekiel 23:4) 
And their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah the younger. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And these are their names: Samaria, Oholah, and Jerusalem, Oholibah.

(Ezekiel 23:5) 
And Oholah committed fornication, though she was mine, and lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, who lived nearby,

(Ezekiel 23:6) 
dressed in hyacinth, captains and rulers, young men eager for war, all chosen, horsemen, and men of war.

(Ezekiel 23:7) 
And she gave her acts of fornication to them, all the chosen sons of the Assyrians, all those in whom was her desire. And she was defiled with their idols.

(Ezekiel 23:8) 
And she did not forsake her acts of fornication from Egypt. For when she slept with him, she lay with him, and she defiled her acts of fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:9) 
And I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.

(Ezekiel 23:10) 
These exposed her nakedness, and took away her sons and her daughters. And they killed Oholah with the sword, and she became a warning to women, when judgment was passed on her.

(Ezekiel 23:11) 
And her sister Oholibah saw this. And lusting, she surpassed her acts of fornication, and more than the other. And her acts of fornication surpassed the acts of her sister.

(Ezekiel 23:12) 
Lusting after the Assyrians, captains and rulers who lived nearby, dressed in finery, horsemen and men of war, all chosen young men.

(Ezekiel 23:13) 
And I saw that she was defiled, for both of them were on the same path.

(Ezekiel 23:14) 
And she multiplied her acts of fornication. For when she saw men painted on the wall, images of the Chaldeans painted in color,

(Ezekiel 23:15) 
with their loins girded and their heads with tiaras, the appearance of captains and rulers, the likenesses of the sons of Babylon, the land of their birth,

(Ezekiel 23:16) 
she lusted after them with her eyes, and she sent messengers to the Chaldeans.

(Ezekiel 23:17) 
And the sons of Babylon came to her in the bed of love, and defiled her in her fornication, and she was defiled in them, and her soul was turned away from them.

(Ezekiel 23:18) 
And she revealed her acts of fornication, and uncovered her nakedness. And my soul was turned away from her, as my soul was turned away from her sister.

(Ezekiel 23:19) 
And she multiplied her acts of fornication, remembering the days of her youth, in which she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 23:20) 
And she lusted after their concubitus, whose flesh was like the flesh of donkeys, and whose seed was like the seed of horses.

(Ezekiel 23:21) 
And you brought back the shame of your youth, and the breaking of your nipples, by the hand of the Egyptians, because of the breasts of your youth.

(Ezekiel 23:22) 
Therefore, Oholah, behold, I will gather all your lovers, for whom you had a mind, and all whom you have loved with all those in whom you lusted: and I will gather them against you from all sides, and I will reveal your nakedness to them, and I will show them all your fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:23) 
And I will judge you with the judgments of adulteresses and those who shed blood, and I will give you to the blood of wrath and zeal.

(Ezekiel 23:24) 
And I will deliver you into their hand, and they will plunder you, and they will tear down your buildings, and take away your garments, and take your vessels of glory. And I will bring you to them, and give you into their hand.

(Ezekiel 23:25) 
And they will bring upon you my fury, and they will make you into the fury of zeal, and take away your nose and your ears. And those who remain will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and your daughters, and those who remain will be burned with fire.

(Ezekiel 23:26) 
And they will take away your garments, and take your vessels of glory.

(Ezekiel 23:27) 
And I will put your memory away from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes towards them, and you will not remember Egypt any more.

(Ezekiel 23:28) 
For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul has turned away.

(Ezekiel 23:29) 
And they will make you hated, and take away everything you have worked for. And they will leave you naked and deserted, and the shame of your fornications and your sins will be revealed.

(Ezekiel 23:30) 
These things will they do to you, because you have committed fornication after the gentiles, and you have been defiled with their idols.

(Ezekiel 23:31) 
You have walked in the way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand.

(Ezekiel 23:32) 
Thus says the Lord God: You will drink your sister's cup, therefore you will give it in your hand, and drink it. And you will mock, and despise, and cease to mourn.

(Ezekiel 23:33) 
For you have filled your sister's cup, and you will give it in your hand, and drink it, and you will drain it to the dregs, and break your bones in pieces.

(Ezekiel 23:34) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have forgotten me, you have cast me behind your back, therefore you will bear your iniquity and your fornications.

(Ezekiel 23:35) 
And the Lord said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? And show them their crimes?

(Ezekiel 23:36) 
And you have given judgment to Oholah and Oholibah, and shown them all their wickedness.

(Ezekiel 23:37) 
Because they have committed fornication, and in their hands are crimes, and they have committed fornication with their idols, and they have given their sons, whom they bore to me, to them for food.

(Ezekiel 23:38) 
But even this they did to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they violated my Sabbaths.

(Ezekiel 23:39) 
And when they had sacrificed their sons to their idols, they came into my sanctuary on the same day to defile it. And behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.

(Ezekiel 23:40) 
For they sent for handsome men coming from afar, to whom messengers were sent. And behold, they came. For whom you washed yourself, and painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments, and placed yourself on a bed.

(Ezekiel 23:41) 
And you sat on a bed of incense, and my table was set before you, upon which you placed my incense and my oil.

(Ezekiel 23:42) 
And there was the voice of a multitude in her, and with men of the common people brought from the desert. And they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their heads.

(Ezekiel 23:43) 
And I said: Will they commit fornication in their old age? And now is their fornication.

(Ezekiel 23:44) 
And they entered to her as to a woman of prostitution. Thus they entered to Oholah and Oholibah, wicked women, and themselves wicked.

(Ezekiel 23:45) 
And just men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and the judgment of those who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

(Ezekiel 23:46) 
For thus says the Lord God: I will bring against them a multitude, and I will give them to be shaken and plundered.

(Ezekiel 23:47) 
And the multitude will stone them with stones, and pierce them with swords, and they will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.

(Ezekiel 23:48) 
And I will remove wickedness from the land, and every woman will be corrected, and they will not act according to your wickedness.

(Ezekiel 23:49) 
And I will bring your wickedness upon you, and you will bear the sins of your idols, and you will know that I am the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 24:1) 
In the ninth year of the exile, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:2) 
“Son of man, write down the name of this very day: The king of Babylon has launched his attack against Jerusalem this very day.”

(Ezekiel 24:3) 
“Then speak a parable to this rebellious house. Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Put the pot on the fire. Put it on the fire, and then pour water into it.’”

(Ezekiel 24:4) 
“‘Put into it every piece of meat: the best pieces, the thigh, and the shoulder. Fill it with choice bones.”

(Ezekiel 24:5) 
“‘Take the best of the flock, and heap the wood together to make it boil. Cook the meat in it.”

(Ezekiel 24:6) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Woe to this city of bloodshed! Woe to this pot, whose rust is in it! The rust has not left it.”

(Ezekiel 24:7) 
“‘She poured blood into it, and put it on a bare rock. She did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dirt.”

(Ezekiel 24:8) 
“‘I have given her blood to be poured on the bare rock. This was to cause wrath, and to take vengeance.”

(Ezekiel 24:9) 
“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Woe to this city of bloodshed! I will make the pyre of wood great, and I will cause the fire to burn hot.”

(Ezekiel 24:10) 
“‘Add more wood. Let the fire burn hotter. Let the meat be cooked, seasoned, and the bones be burned.”

(Ezekiel 24:11) 
“‘Then let the empty pot be set on the hot coals, so that it becomes hot, and so that its bronze is burned away, and its rust is corrupted.”

(Ezekiel 24:12) 
“‘It has become worn out with labor, but its great rust has not left it. In the fire, its rust will be destroyed.”

(Ezekiel 24:13) 
“‘Because of the sins which you have, you are unclean. I have tried to cleanse you, but you were not cleansed. You will not be cleansed from your filth, until my wrath against you is at rest.”

(Ezekiel 24:14) 
“‘I, the Lord, have spoken. It will come to pass and I will act. I will not relent, and my eye will not pity you. I will judge you according to your ways and your deeds,’ says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 24:15) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:16) 
“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the delight of your eyes by a blow. You will not weep, nor lament, and your tears will not come.”

(Ezekiel 24:17) 
“Groan silently. Do not mourn for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet. Do not cover your mouth, nor eat the food of other men.”

(Ezekiel 24:18) 
So, I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. In the morning, I did as I was commanded.

(Ezekiel 24:19) 
Then the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean which you are doing?”

(Ezekiel 24:20) 
And I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 24:21) 
“‘Speak to the house of Israel: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I will pollute my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your soul. And your sons and your daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword.”

(Ezekiel 24:22) 
“‘You will do as I have done: You will not cover your mouths, nor eat the food of other men.”

(Ezekiel 24:23) 
“‘Your turbans will remain on your heads, and your shoes will remain on your feet. You will not mourn, nor weep. But you will waste away in your iniquities, and you will groan to one another.”

(Ezekiel 24:24) 
“‘Thus, Ezekiel will be a sign to you. You will do according to all that he has done. When this comes, you will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 24:25) 
“‘And you, son of man, will not you, on the day that I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the delight of their eyes, and that upon which their souls long, their sons and their daughters?

(Ezekiel 24:26) 
“‘On that day, someone will come to you, fleeing to tell you the news.”

(Ezekiel 24:27) 
“‘On that day your mouth will be opened with him who has fled, and you will speak and will no longer be silent. You will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 25:1) 
The Lord spoke a message to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 25:2) 
Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy about them.

(Ezekiel 25:3) 
And say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord God. The Lord God says this: Because you said “Aha!” in response to the destruction of my holy place, because it was profaned, and in response to the land of Israel, because it was desolate, and in response to the house of Judah, because they were led away captive,

(Ezekiel 25:4) 
therefore I will give you over to the sons of the East, to take possession, and they will set up their camps in you, and they will set up their tents in you: they will eat your fruits, and they will drink your milk.

(Ezekiel 25:5) 
And I will turn Rabbah into a stable for camels, and the Ammonites into a resting place for flocks: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:6) 
For the Lord God says this: Because you clapped your hands, and stamped your foot, and rejoiced with all the disdain against the land of Israel,

(Ezekiel 25:7) 
therefore I will stretch out my hand over you, and I will give you as plunder to the nations: and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the lands, and I will scatter you: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:8) 
The Lord God says this: Because Moab and Seir said: Behold, like all the nations, the house of Judah.

(Ezekiel 25:9) 
Therefore I will open the side of Moab from its borders, from its cities, from its borders, and its glory, and its strongest ones: and from the sons of Ammon.

(Ezekiel 25:10) 
I will give it with the sons of Ammon as a possession, so that they will not be remembered among the nations: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 25:11) 
For the Lord God says this: Because Edom took revenge against the house of Judah, and offended it, and took revenge.

(Ezekiel 25:12) 
Therefore the Lord God says this: I will stretch out my hand over Edom, and I will cut off from it man and beast, and I will make it a desolation, from Teman even to Dedan: by the sword they will fall.

(Ezekiel 25:13) 
And I will take my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they will act in Edom according to my wrath, and my fury: and they will know my vengeance, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 25:14) 
The Lord God says this: Because the Philistines have taken revenge, and vengeance with a spirit of contempt, to extermination, because of eternal hatred:

(Ezekiel 25:15) 
therefore the Lord God says this: Behold, I will stretch out my hand over the Philistines, and I will destroy the remnant of the Cretans, and the rest of the sea.

(Ezekiel 25:16) 
And I will take great vengeance on them by means of reproaches of fury: and they will know that I am the Lord, when I shall have taken my vengeance on them.

(Ezekiel 26:1) 
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:2) 
Son of man, because Tyre said of Jerusalem: “Aha! The gates of the nations are broken; she is turned over to me; I will be filled, now that she is laid waste:”

(Ezekiel 26:3) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.

(Ezekiel 26:4) 
They will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her soil from her and make her like a bare rock.

(Ezekiel 26:5) 
She will become a place for spreading nets in the sea, and for the merchants of the nations; for I have spoken,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 26:6) 
Thus says the Lord God: “Because you have said: ‘I am perfect in beauty,’ therefore, behold, I will bring strangers against you.

(Ezekiel 26:7) 
They will unsheathe their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will defile your splendor.

(Ezekiel 26:8) 
They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.

(Ezekiel 26:9) 
Will you then say, ‘I am God,’ in the presence of your killers? You are a man, and not God, in the hands of those who slay you.

(Ezekiel 26:10) 
You will die the death of the uncircumcised, by the hand of strangers, for I have spoken,” says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 26:11) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:12) 
Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre.

(Ezekiel 26:13) 
And say to him: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

(Ezekiel 26:14) 
You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: sardius, topaz, and diamond, chrysolite, onyx, and beryl, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald; and gold was the work of your settings and your sockets. On the day that you were created they were prepared.

(Ezekiel 26:15) 
You were an anointed cherub who covers, and I placed you on the holy mountain of God; you were in the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 26:16) 
You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, until iniquity was found in you.

(Ezekiel 26:17) 
In the abundance of your trade, your heart was filled with violence, and you sinned; therefore, I cast you out of the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 26:18) 
Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I laid you before kings, that they might gaze at you.

(Ezekiel 26:19) 
By the multitude of your iniquities, in the iniquity of your trade you have profaned your sanctuaries; therefore I have brought fire out from your midst; it has devoured you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who see you.

(Ezekiel 26:20) 
All who knew you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have become a terror, and shall be no more forever.”

(Ezekiel 26:21) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 26:22) 
Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her.

(Ezekiel 26:23) 
And say, “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I execute judgments in her, and I am sanctified in her.

(Ezekiel 26:24) 
For I will send a plague upon her, and blood in her streets; and the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword against her on every side. Then they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 26:25) 
And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn for the house of Israel from any who are around them and who have treated them with contempt. Then they shall know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 26:26) 
Thus says the Lord God: ‘When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and I am sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 26:27) 
And they will dwell securely in it, and they will build houses and plant vineyards, and they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. Then they shall know that I am the Lord their God.’

(Ezekiel 27:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 27:2) 
“Son of man, sing a lamentation over Tyre,

(Ezekiel 27:3) 
and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, who trades with the peoples on the islands, ‘The Lord God says this: “O Tyre, you said: ‘I am perfect in beauty.’”

(Ezekiel 27:4) 
“In the heart of the seas are your boundaries. Those who built you perfected your beauty.

(Ezekiel 27:5) 
“They made all your planks from the fir trees of Sharon. They took cedars from Lebanon to make the mast for you.

(Ezekiel 27:6) 
“They made your oars from the oak of Bashan, and your house from ivory, which they brought from the islands of the Kittim.

(Ezekiel 27:7) 
“Fine linen from Egypt was your sail, that it might be as a banner to you. Hyacinth and purple from the islands of Elisha were your covering.

(Ezekiel 27:8) 
“The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men, O Tyre, were in you, your pilots.

(Ezekiel 27:9) 
“The elders of Gebal and its wise men repaired your gaps. All the ships of the sea and its sailors were in you, in your trading.

(Ezekiel 27:10) 
“Persians and Lydians, and Libyans were in your army. Your men in battle hung up their shield and helmet. They displayed your glory.

(Ezekiel 27:11) 
“The sons of Arvad and all your army were on your walls all around, and your towers were with their arms. Your shields hung on your walls all around. They perfected your beauty.

(Ezekiel 27:12) 
“Tarshish was your merchant in the multitude of all riches, in silver, iron, tin, lead, they traded in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:13) 
“Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants. They traded the souls of men and bronze vessels in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:14) 
“From the house of Togarmah they brought horses and horsemen and mules in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:15) 
“The sons of Dedan were your merchants. Many islands were your merchants. They paid you ivory tusks and ebony.

(Ezekiel 27:16) 
“Syria was your merchant in the multitude of your works, in gems, and purple, and in various colors, and in fine linen, and in silk, and in chrysolite in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:17) 
“Judah and the land of Israel were your merchants. They offered your merchandise of the first wheat, and in honey, and in oil, and balsam in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:18) 
“Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of your works, in the multitude of riches, in the wine of Damascus, and in white wool.

(Ezekiel 27:19) 
“Dan, and Greece, and Uzal, were in your markets. Wrought iron, and cassia, and calamus, were in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:20) 
“Dedan was your merchant in horse cloths for chariots.

(Ezekiel 27:21) 
“Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were your merchants, in lambs, and rams, and in goats, they were your merchants.

(Ezekiel 27:22) 
“The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were your merchants. In all the best spices, and in all precious stones, and in gold, they offered them in your markets.

(Ezekiel 27:23) 
“Haran, and Kenah, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.

(Ezekiel 27:24) 
“These were your merchants in diverse clothes, in hyacinth and in silk, and in chrysolite, and in purple, and in tapestries, and in a chest, and in the best vessels, they traded against you.

(Ezekiel 27:25) 
“The ships of the sea traded with you in your meditation. And you are filled in your parts, and you are greatly glorified in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 27:26) 
“Your rowers brought you into the many waters. The south wind broke you in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 27:27) 
“Your riches and your treasures, and your markets, your sailors and your pilots, those who repair your gaps, and those who traded in your trading: all the men of war who are in you, with your entire assembly, will fall into the middle of the sea on the day of your ruin.

(Ezekiel 27:28) 
“At the sound of the cry of your rowers, the shepherds trembled.

(Ezekiel 27:29) 
“And all those who held the oars will come down from the ships. The sailors and all the pilots of the sea will stand over you.

(Ezekiel 27:30) 
“And they will weep over you with a great voice, and they will wail, and they will throw dust on their heads, and will be sprinkled with ashes.

(Ezekiel 27:31) 
“And they will make themselves bald because of you, and they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and they will weep for you in the bitterness of their soul, a bitter lamentation.

(Ezekiel 27:32) 
“And they will take up a lamentation over you, and weep for you, saying: ‘Who is like Tyre, which was silent in the middle of the sea?

(Ezekiel 27:33) 
“When your merchandise went out from the sea, you satisfied many peoples. In the multitude of your riches and your trading, you enriched all the kings of the earth.

(Ezekiel 27:34) 
“Now you are broken by the sea in the depths of the waters. Your merchandise and all your multitude have fallen in your midst.

(Ezekiel 27:35) 
“All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished over you, and their kings were troubled and were greatly saddened in their faces.

(Ezekiel 27:36) 
“The merchants of the peoples will hiss over you, and you will be a terror, and you will no longer be forever.”

(Ezekiel 28:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:2) 
“Son of man, speak to the prince of Tyre: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “Because your heart has become proud, and you have said: “I am a god; I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the sea,” although you are a man and not God, and you have given your heart as if it were the heart of God.”’

(Ezekiel 28:3) 
“Behold, you are wise, and nothing can be hidden from you.

(Ezekiel 28:4) 
“By your wisdom and your prudence you have made strength for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver in your treasures.

(Ezekiel 28:5) 
“By the abundance of your wisdom, and in your commerce, you have multiplied your strength: and your heart has been lifted up in your strength.

(Ezekiel 28:6) 
“Therefore, these are the words of the Lord God: ‘Because your heart has been lifted up as the heart of God,

(Ezekiel 28:7) 
“therefore, behold, I will bring against you strangers, the most powerful of the nations: and they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and will defile your glory.

(Ezekiel 28:8) 
“They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die in the death of the wounded in the heart of the sea.

(Ezekiel 28:9) 
“Will you say, ‘I am a god,’ before your killers, when you are a man and not God, in the hand of those who kill you?

(Ezekiel 28:10) 
“You will die the death of the uncircumcised in the hand of strangers, because I have spoken, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 28:11) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:12) 
“Son of man, take up a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

(Ezekiel 28:13) 
“You were in the delights of the paradise of God: every precious stone was your covering, sardius, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, and onyx, and beryl, sapphire, and carbuncle, and emerald: gold, the work of your beauty, and your openings, were prepared in the day that you were created.

(Ezekiel 28:14) 
“You were a cherub with extended wings, protecting, and I placed you on the holy mountain of God: you were in the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 28:15) 
“You were perfect in your ways from the day of your creation, until iniquity was found in you.

(Ezekiel 28:16) 
“By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with iniquity, and you sinned: and I will cast you out from the mountain of God, and will destroy you, cherub, protecting, from the midst of the stones of fire.

(Ezekiel 28:17) 
“And your heart was lifted up in your beauty, you have destroyed your wisdom in your splendor: I cast you to the earth, I placed you before the face of kings, that they may see you.

(Ezekiel 28:18) 
“By the multitude of your iniquity, and in your commerce, you have defiled your holy places: and I will bring fire from the midst of you, which will consume you, and I will give you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all those who see you.

(Ezekiel 28:19) 
“All those who see you among the nations are astonished at you: you have become a terror, and you will be no more.”

(Ezekiel 28:20) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 28:21) 
“Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it,

(Ezekiel 28:22) 
“and say: ‘These are the words of the Lord God: “Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in your midst: and they will know that I am the Lord, when I have executed judgments in it, and have been sanctified in it.

(Ezekiel 28:23) 
“And I will send a pestilence upon it, and blood in its streets: and the slain will fall in the midst of it by the sword that is against it: and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 28:24) 
“And the house of Israel will no longer have a piercing thorn, nor a painful thorn, from all those who are around it, who have despised it: and they will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 28:25) 
“These are the words of the Lord God: ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations: and they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob.

(Ezekiel 28:26) 
“And they will live there securely, and they will build houses, and plant vineyards: and they will live confidently, when I have executed judgment on all those who oppress them around them: and they will know that I am the Lord their God.”

(Ezekiel 29:1) 
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Son spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 29:2) 
Son of man, turn your face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 29:3) 
Speak and say: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon who lies in the middle of your streams, who says: “The Nile is mine, and I made myself.”'

(Ezekiel 29:4) 
And I will put a bit in your jaws, and I will bind the fish of your streams to your scales, and I will bring you out of the middle of your streams, and all the fish of your streams I will bind to your scales.

(Ezekiel 29:5) 
And I will cast you into the desert, and all the fish of your streams: you will fall on the face of the field, you will not be gathered, nor will you be collected: I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky.

(Ezekiel 29:6) 
And all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord, because you were a broken reed to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 29:7) 
When they took hold of you with the hand, you were broken, and you loosened all their loins: and when they leaned on you, you were broken, and you loosened all their backs.

(Ezekiel 29:8) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and I will kill man and beast from you.

(Ezekiel 29:9) 
And the land of Egypt will be a desert, and a wasteland: and they will know that I am the Lord, because you said: “The Nile is mine, and I made myself.”

(Ezekiel 29:10) 
Therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt deserts, a wasteland, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 29:11) 
The foot of man will not pass through it, and the foot of the beast will not tread it, nor will it be inhabited for forty years.

(Ezekiel 29:12) 
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the desolate lands, and her cities desolate in the midst of the desolate cities, for forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will disperse them through the countries.

(Ezekiel 29:13) 
For thus says the Lord God: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.

(Ezekiel 29:14) 
And I will bring back the Egyptians, and I will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin: and there they will be a small kingdom.

(Ezekiel 29:15) 
And it will be small among the kingdoms, and it will not be exalted any more above the nations: and I will not add that they should rule over the nations.

(Ezekiel 29:16) 
And there will no longer be hope for the house of Israel, remembering their iniquity, when they have turned after them: and they will know that I am the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 29:17) 
In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the Son spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 29:18) 
Son of man, the Chaldeans have taken captives from Tyre and Sidon: because they handed Egypt over to the power of the nations: and I have given it into their hand.

(Ezekiel 29:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon: and he will take away its multitude, and will plunder its spoils, and will take its plunder: and it will be the reward of his army.

(Ezekiel 29:20) 
I have given him a reward for the work he has done in the land of Egypt: because they labored for me, says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 29:21) 
“On that day I will make the horn of the house of Israel sprout, and I will give you a mouth among them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 30:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 30:2) 
Son of man, prophesy and say: "These are the words of the Lord God: Howl, 'Woe, the day!' Woe, the day!"

(Ezekiel 30:3) 
Because the day is near. The day of the Lord is near: a day of darkness, of clouds, and of thick gloom. The day will be on the land, and the trumpet will be sounded there.

(Ezekiel 30:4) 
I will bring about chaos in Egypt, and there will be pain in Ethiopia, and those who are strong will enter Egypt. Its foundations will be destroyed.

(Ezekiel 30:5) 
The Ethiopians, and the Libyans, and the Lydians, and every mixed crowd, and Chub, and the sons of the land that is in league, they will fall with the sword.

(Ezekiel 30:6) 
These are the words of the Lord: "Those who support Egypt will fall, and the pride of its strength will be humbled. The sword will fall on them, from the tower of Syene," says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 30:7) 
I will make the land of Egypt desolate, and I will bring about solitude there, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Ezekiel 30:8) 
The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have put fire in Egypt, and all its helpers have been destroyed.

(Ezekiel 30:9) 
In that day, messengers will go out from my presence in ships, to destroy confident Ethiopia, and there will be terror among them, as in the day of Egypt, because, behold, it comes.

(Ezekiel 30:10) 
These are the words of the Lord God: "I will destroy the multitude of Egypt, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

(Ezekiel 30:11) 
He and his people with him, who are the strongest of the nations, will be for the destruction of the land: they will draw their swords against Egypt, and they will fill the land with the slain.

(Ezekiel 30:12) 
I will dry up the rivers, and I will hand the land over to the hand of the wicked, and I will desolate the land and its fullness, by the hand of foreigners: I, the Lord, have spoken.

(Ezekiel 30:13) 
These are the words of the Lord God: "I will destroy the idols, and I will break the images of Memphis: there will be no prince from the land of Egypt, and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:14) 
I will desolate Pathros, and I will put fire in Taphnis, and I will bring about judgments in Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:15) 
I will pour out my indignation on Sin, the strength of Egypt, and I will destroy the multitude of Alexandria.

(Ezekiel 30:16) 
I will put fire in Egypt: Sin will be troubled, Alexandria will be troubled, and Memphis will be brought into distress during the day.

(Ezekiel 30:17) 
The young men of Aven and Phibeseth will fall by the sword, and they will be led into captivity.

(Ezekiel 30:18) 
In Taphnis, the day will also be darkened, when I break the scepters of Egypt there, and the pride of its strength will cease in it. A cloud will cover it, and its daughters will be led into captivity.

(Ezekiel 30:19) 
I will bring about judgments in Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 30:20) 
In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 30:21) 
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt: and behold, it is not bound up so that it may be put in cloths to heal it, nor tied, that it might have strength to carry the sword.

(Ezekiel 30:22) 
Therefore, these are the words of the Lord God: "Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, both the strong ones and the broken ones: and I will cast the sword from his hand.

(Ezekiel 30:23) 
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will scatter them throughout the lands.

(Ezekiel 30:24) 
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will put my sword in his hand, and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and the groans of the slain will groan before him.

(Ezekiel 30:25) 
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall, and they will know that I am the Lord, when I put my sword in the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out over the land of Egypt.

(Ezekiel 30:26) 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will scatter them throughout the lands, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 31:1) 
In the eleventh year, in the third month, the word of the Lord came to me saying:

(Ezekiel 31:2) 
Son of man, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his people: “To whom are you like, in your glory and greatness?”

(Ezekiel 31:3) 
Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in its branches, its foliage gave shade, it was tall, and its top was in the clouds.

(Ezekiel 31:4) 
Water nourished it, the deep lifted it up; its rivers flowed around its planting, and it sent out its streams to all the trees.

(Ezekiel 31:5) 
Therefore its top was raised above all the trees of the region, and its branches multiplied, and its arms extended into the many waters, when it sent out its height.

(Ezekiel 31:6) 
In its branches nested all the birds of the sky, and under its branches made their nests all the beasts of the earth, and under its shadow dwelt many nations.

(Ezekiel 31:7) 
And it became beautiful in its greatness and in the length of its branches, because its root was near many waters.

(Ezekiel 31:8) 
The cedars were not higher than it in the paradise of God; the fir trees did not equal its branches, and the plane trees were not like its leaves; no tree in the paradise of God was like it in its beauty.

(Ezekiel 31:9) 
I made it beautiful in the multitude of its branches, and all the trees of pleasure that were in the paradise of God envied it.

(Ezekiel 31:10) 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because it was exalted in height, and its top gave itself to the clouds, and its heart was lifted up in its height,

(Ezekiel 31:11) 
I delivered it into the hand of the most powerful of the nations: he will deal with it; I have done to it according to its wickedness.

(Ezekiel 31:12) 
And strangers from the nations threw it down, and I cast it on the mountains, and its branches fell in the valleys, and its arms were broken by all the rivers of the earth, and all the peoples left its shadow and abandoned it.

(Ezekiel 31:13) 
On its ruin will dwell all the birds of the sky, and in its branches will be all the beasts of the earth:

(Ezekiel 31:14) 
so that no tree of the waters will exalt itself in its height, nor set its top in the clouds, when all the trees of the waters are delivered to death in the lower earth, in the midst of the children of men who go down to the pit.

(Ezekiel 31:15) 
Thus says the Lord God: On the day that it went down to hell, I mourned; I covered it with the abyss and restrained its rivers and held back the many waters: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field were broken over it.

(Ezekiel 31:16) 
I heard the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to hell; and because of it trembled all the trees of pleasure that were in Lebanon, and all who were nourished on the earth.

(Ezekiel 31:17) 
They also went down with it to hell, to those who had been killed by the sword, and its arm, which dwelt under its shadow in the midst of the nations.

(Ezekiel 31:18) 
To whom are you like in glory and greatness among the trees of pleasure? Now you will be led down with the trees of pleasure to the lower earth: in the midst of the uncircumcised, you will sleep with those killed by the sword. This is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:1) 
The Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 32:2) 
Son of man, make a lament for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him: The lion of the nations is destroyed.

(Ezekiel 32:3) 
Like a dragon in the waters, you were crushing nations: you went out with your rivers, and you stirred up the waters with your feet, and you trampled their streams.

(Ezekiel 32:4) 
Thus says the Lord God: I will spread out my net over you with a multitude of peoples, and I will bring you into my snares.

(Ezekiel 32:5) 
And I will cast you upon the land, and I will cast you upon the face of the field: and I will make all the birds of the sky dwell upon you, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with you.

(Ezekiel 32:6) 
And I will give your flesh upon the mountains, and I will fill the valleys with your height.

(Ezekiel 32:7) 
And I will dry up the land, when you are extinguished, and I will cover the skies, and I will darken its stars: I will veil the sun with clouds, and the moon will not give its light.

(Ezekiel 32:8) 
I will make dark all the lights of the sky's splendor over you, and I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:9) 
And I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.

(Ezekiel 32:10) 
And I will make the nations desolate over you, and their kings will shudder over you, when I brandish my sword before their faces: and they will tremble in an instant, each one for his own soul, on the day of your ruin.

(Ezekiel 32:11) 
For thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you.

(Ezekiel 32:12) 
I will cast you down by the hands of the mighty, the terror of the nations: and I will set you upon the high mountains, and your hearts will perish, and you will die in the midst of the sea.

(Ezekiel 32:13) 
And I will make all its beasts cease, and I will destroy all its cattle upon the many waters: the foot of man will no longer disturb them, nor will the hoof of cattle trample them.

(Ezekiel 32:14) 
Then I will make their waters clear, and I will cause their rivers to flow like oil, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:15) 
When I have made the land of Egypt desolate, and have left the land from its fullness, when I strike all those who dwell in it: then you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 32:16) 
This is the lamentation, and the daughters of the nations will weep for it: for Egypt and for all its multitude: for the daughters of the nations.

(Ezekiel 32:17) 
Now it happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first of the month, that the Word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 32:18) 
Son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt, and cast it down, you and the daughters of the famous nations, into the deepest parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:19) 
Whom do you surpass in beauty? When you go down, you will sleep with the uncircumcised.

(Ezekiel 32:20) 
They will fall in the midst of those slain by the sword: the sword has been given, they are laid waste, with all its multitude.

(Ezekiel 32:21) 
The mighty will speak to him from among the mighty, from the midst of the underworld: they have gone down, they have slept uncircumcised, who were slain by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:22) 
Assyria is there, and all its company: around his tomb all those slain, and those who have fallen by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:23) 
Whose tomb they have placed in the depths of the pit, and his company around his tomb: all the slain, and those who have fallen by the sword, who have given terror in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:24) 
There is Elam, and all its multitude around his tomb: all those slain, and those who have fallen by the sword: who have gone down uncircumcised into the depths of the earth, who have given terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who have gone down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:25) 
They have given a bed among those slain with all its multitude: around his tomb, all the uncircumcised: because they have given terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who have gone down into the pit: in the midst of the slain.

(Ezekiel 32:26) 
There is Meshech, Tubal, and all its multitude: around him is his tomb, all the uncircumcised, who were slain by the sword: for they thought themselves wicked in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:27) 
And they did not sleep with the mighty, who have fallen from the nations, who have gone down into hell with their weapons, and have placed their swords under their heads: and their iniquities were upon their bones, because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:28) 
But you, in the midst of the uncircumcised, will be broken, and you will sleep with those slain by the sword.

(Ezekiel 32:29) 
There are the leaders, and all their multitude: around their tomb, all the uncircumcised, who have fallen by the sword, with those who have given terror in the land of the living.

(Ezekiel 32:30) 
There are the princes of the north, everyone, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, terrified, and confused in their strength: and they have placed their shame with those who have gone down into the pit.

(Ezekiel 32:31) 
Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude: Pharaoh, and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 32:32) 
For I have given my terror in the land of the living, and he will sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised: with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 33:1) 
The Lord's Word came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 33:2) 
“Son of man, speak to the people and say to them: 'If I bring a sword to the land, and the people of the land take a man, and make him their watchman',

(Ezekiel 33:3) 
“If the watchman sees the sword coming to the land, and blows the trumpet, and warns the people,”

(Ezekiel 33:4) 
“If the one who hears the sound of the trumpet, does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away: his blood will be on his own head.”

(Ezekiel 33:5) 
“He heard the sound of the trumpet, but he didn’t take warning: his blood will be on him. If he takes warning, he will save his life.”

(Ezekiel 33:6) 
“But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet, and the people do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes away any of them, the watchman is the cause of his own death, and I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.”

(Ezekiel 33:7) 
“So you, son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. You will hear the word from my mouth, and you shall warn them from me.”

(Ezekiel 33:8) 
“If I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you shall surely die', and you do not speak to warn the wicked man to turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood from your hand.”

(Ezekiel 33:9) 
“If you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.”

(Ezekiel 33:10) 
“Therefore, son of man, tell the house of Israel, 'You are saying, “Our sins and our iniquities are upon us, and we waste away because of them. How then can we live?”'

(Ezekiel 33:11) 
“Tell them, as I live, says the Lord God, I don't want the wicked to die, but that the wicked would turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways, and why will you die, O house of Israel?”

(Ezekiel 33:12) 
“You, son of man, tell the children of your people, 'The justice of the just will not deliver him in the day that he sins; and the wickedness of the wicked will not hurt him on the day that he turns from his wickedness. And the just man will not be able to live in his justice on the day that he sins.”

(Ezekiel 33:13) 
“'When I tell the just man that he will surely live, and he trusts in his justice and sins, all his acts of justice will be forgotten, and in the iniquity he committed, he will die.”

(Ezekiel 33:14) 
“And when I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die', and he does penance for his sin, and does what is lawful and right,”

(Ezekiel 33:15) 
“'if the wicked restores the pledge, and gives back what he had stolen, and walks in the commandments of life, not doing any injustice: he shall live, and not die.”

(Ezekiel 33:16) 
“None of his sins which he committed will be remembered. He did what is lawful and right, he shall live.”

(Ezekiel 33:17) 
“And the children of your people say, 'The way of the Lord is not just', when it is their own way that is perverted.”

(Ezekiel 33:18) 
“When the just man turns from his justice, and does iniquity, he shall die in his iniquity.”

(Ezekiel 33:19) 
“And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does what is lawful and right, he will live in them.”

(Ezekiel 33:20) 
“And you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just', but I will judge each of you according to your ways, O house of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 33:21) 
“And in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, there came to me a man who had escaped from Jerusalem, saying: The city is taken!”

(Ezekiel 33:22) 
“And the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, before the one who had escaped came to me, and He opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning, and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer silent.”

(Ezekiel 33:23) 
“And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:”

(Ezekiel 33:24) 
“Son of man, the inhabitants of these deserts speak among themselves, saying: 'Abraham was one, and he possessed the land, but we are many; therefore the land has been given to us to possess.”

(Ezekiel 33:25) 
“So tell them, thus says the Lord God: 'Will you possess the land when you eat with blood, and lift your eyes to your idols, and have shed blood?'

(Ezekiel 33:26) 
“'You have stood by your sword, you have committed abomination, and you have defiled the wife of your neighbor, and will you possess the land?'

(Ezekiel 33:27) 
“Tell them, thus says the Lord God: 'As I live, those who are in the deserts shall fall by the sword. And whoever is in the open country, I will give them to be eaten by beasts; and those who are in the fortresses and in the caves, shall die of the plague.”

(Ezekiel 33:28) 
“I will make the land a desert, and a horror; and the pride of its power shall be confounded, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, and no one shall pass through them.”

(Ezekiel 33:29) 
“And they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desert because of all their abominations that they have done.”

(Ezekiel 33:30) 
“And you, son of man, your people are talking about you by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and they are speaking to each other, saying: 'Come and hear what is the word that is coming from the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 33:31) 
“And they come to you as the people come, and sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them, for they make it like a song of love with their mouths, but their hearts are set on greed.”

(Ezekiel 33:32) 
“And you will be like a song of love to them with a sweet voice and skill in singing, and they will hear your words, but they will not do them.”

(Ezekiel 33:33) 
“When this comes to pass, then it will come to pass, and they will know that a prophet was among them.”

(Ezekiel 34:1) 
The Lord's word came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 34:2) 
“Son of man, prophesy to the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and tell the shepherds, ‘Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who feed themselves! Do not the shepherds feed the sheep?

(Ezekiel 34:3) 
“You eat the milk, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed my flock.

(Ezekiel 34:4) 
“You have not strengthened the weak, nor healed the sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back the strayed, nor sought the lost; but you have ruled them with force and cruelty.

(Ezekiel 34:5) 
“My sheep were scattered, because they had no shepherd; and they became food for all the wild beasts of the field, and were scattered.

(Ezekiel 34:6) 
“My sheep wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill. Yes, my sheep were scattered across the whole earth, and there was no one to seek them or look for them.

(Ezekiel 34:7) 
“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

(Ezekiel 34:8) 
“As I live, says the Lord God, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, because there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds did not seek my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and did not feed my sheep:

(Ezekiel 34:9) 
“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

(Ezekiel 34:10) 
“Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and will make them cease from feeding the flock; and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves. I will deliver my flock from their mouths, and they shall no longer be food for them.

(Ezekiel 34:11) 
“For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I, even I, will seek my sheep and will visit them.

(Ezekiel 34:12) 
“As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so I will seek out my sheep and will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.

(Ezekiel 34:13) 
“I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

(Ezekiel 34:14) 
“I will feed them in a good pasture, and on the high mountains of Israel shall their pasture be; there they shall lie down in a good grazing ground, and on fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 34:15) 
“I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 34:16) 
“I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice.

(Ezekiel 34:17) 
“As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God: I will judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.

(Ezekiel 34:18) 
“Is it too small a thing for you to feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? And to drink clear water, that you must foul the rest with your feet?

(Ezekiel 34:19) 
“And must my sheep eat what your feet have trodden down, and drink what your feet have fouled?

(Ezekiel 34:20) 
“Therefore, thus says the Lord God to them: Behold, I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

(Ezekiel 34:21) 
“Because you push with side and shoulder, and you thrust with your horns all the weak ones, until you have scattered them abroad,

(Ezekiel 34:22) 
“I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

(Ezekiel 34:23) 
“And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will feed them. He will feed them and he will be their shepherd.

(Ezekiel 34:24) 
“And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the Lord have spoken.

(Ezekiel 34:25) 
“I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will rid the land of evil beasts, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.

(Ezekiel 34:26) 
“And I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing. And I will send down the shower in its season, and there shall be showers of blessing.

(Ezekiel 34:27) 
“And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the land shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. Then they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hand of those who enslaved them.

(Ezekiel 34:28) 
“They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.

(Ezekiel 34:29) 
“I will provide for them a planting of renown, and they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and they shall no longer bear the disgrace of the nations.

(Ezekiel 34:30) 
“And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 34:31) 
“You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 35:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 35:2) 
“Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

(Ezekiel 35:3) 
and tell it: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir! I will extend my hand against you, and I will give you to be a desolation and a solitude.

(Ezekiel 35:4) 
I will make your cities a desolation, and you will be desolate, and you will know that I am the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 35:5) 
“Because you have been an enemy forever and have handed over the children of Israel to the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of their final iniquity,

(Ezekiel 35:6) 
therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will hand you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you, because you have hated bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.

(Ezekiel 35:7) 
I will make Mount Seir a desolation and a desert, and I will take away from it those who come and go.

(Ezekiel 35:8) 
I will fill its mountains with the slain, those wounded by the sword; on your hills, in your valleys, and in your ravines they will fall.

(Ezekiel 35:9) 
I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited, and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 35:10) 
“Because you have said: ‘These two nations, and these two lands, are mine, and we will possess them,’ even though the Lord was there,

(Ezekiel 35:11) 
therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy which you have shown from your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.

(Ezekiel 35:12) 
Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are desolate, they have been given to us to devour.’

(Ezekiel 35:13) 
You have magnified yourselves against me in your mouth, and you have multiplied your words against me; I have heard.

(Ezekiel 35:14) 
Thus says the Lord God: When all the earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.

(Ezekiel 35:15) 
As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you; you will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Idumea, and you will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 36:1) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 36:2) 
Son of man, prophesy against the mountains of Israel, and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord.

(Ezekiel 36:3) 
Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha, aha! The ancient high places are ours! The inheritance of the nations is given to us.”

(Ezekiel 36:4) 
Therefore prophesy over the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I speak in my zeal and in my fury, because you have borne the reproach of the nations.

(Ezekiel 36:5) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I have lifted up my hand, because the nations that are around you will bear your reproach.

(Ezekiel 36:6) 
But you, mountains of Israel, you will shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they will soon be back.

(Ezekiel 36:7) 
For behold, I am with you, and I will turn to you: and you will be cultivated and sown in the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 36:8) 
And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, and the cities will be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt.

(Ezekiel 36:9) 
And I will multiply men upon you and beasts: and they will increase and grow: and I will cause you to dwell as in the days of old, and better than at the beginning: and you will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 36:10) 
And I will bring upon you men, my people Israel: and they will possess you, and you will be an inheritance for them: and you will not again make them barren.

(Ezekiel 36:11) 
Thus says the Lord God: Because they say of you, 'You are a devourer of men, and have been the cause of the loss of your nation.'

(Ezekiel 36:12) 
Therefore you will no longer devour men, nor will you cause your nation to perish, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 36:13) 
And you will no longer hear the reproach of the nations, nor will you bear the insults of your people any longer: and you will not cause the nations to lose their people any longer, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 36:14) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 36:15) 
Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, and defiled it in their way and in their studies: according to the impurity of the menstruating woman their way was before me.

(Ezekiel 36:16) 
And I poured out my indignation upon them, because of the blood they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.

(Ezekiel 36:17) 
And I scattered them among the nations, and they were scattered over the regions: according to their way and their studies I judged them.

(Ezekiel 36:18) 
And they went to the nations to which they had come, and profaned my holy name, when they said of them: 'This is the people of the Lord, and they have come out of his land.'

(Ezekiel 36:19) 
And I spared my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they had come.

(Ezekiel 36:20) 
Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you have come.

(Ezekiel 36:21) 
And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the nations may know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when I am sanctified in you before their eyes.

(Ezekiel 36:22) 
And I will take you from among the nations, and I will gather you from all the lands, and I will bring you into your own land.

(Ezekiel 36:23) 
And I will pour clean water upon you, and you will be cleansed from all your impurities, and I will cleanse you from all your idols.

(Ezekiel 36:24) 
And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in your midst: and I will take away the stony heart from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.

(Ezekiel 36:25) 
And I will put my spirit in your midst: and I will cause you to walk in my precepts, and to keep my judgments, and to perform them.

(Ezekiel 36:26) 
And you will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers: and you will be my people, and I will be your God.

(Ezekiel 36:27) 
And I will save you from all your impurities: and I will call for the grain, and I will multiply it, and I will not bring famine upon you.

(Ezekiel 36:28) 
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, and you will no longer bear the reproach of the nations because of famine.

(Ezekiel 36:29) 
And you will remember your evil ways, and your studies that were not good: and your iniquities and your crimes will displease you.

(Ezekiel 36:30) 
I do not do this for your sake, says the Lord God, let it be known to you: be ashamed and blush for your ways, O house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 36:31) 
Thus says the Lord God: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, and make the cities to be inhabited, and rebuild the ruins,

(Ezekiel 36:32) 
and the desolate land will be cultivated, that was desolate before the eyes of everyone who passed by:

(Ezekiel 36:33) 
and they will say: That land that was desolate has become like the garden of paradise, and the cities that were deserted, and desolate, and destroyed, are fortified.

(Ezekiel 36:34) 
And the nations that are left around you will know that I the Lord have built the ruins, and I have planted what was desolate: I the Lord have spoken and done it.

(Ezekiel 36:35) 
Thus says the Lord God: I will still be inquired of by the house of Israel, that I may do this for them: I will multiply them like a flock of men.

(Ezekiel 36:36) 
As the holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts, so will the desolate cities be, and they will be inhabited: and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 37:1) 
The hand of the Lord came over me, and He took me in the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a plain, which was full of bones.

(Ezekiel 37:2) 
And He led me all around among them. The bones were scattered everywhere on the surface of the plain, and they were very dry.

(Ezekiel 37:3) 
And He said to me, “Son of man, do you think these bones can live again?”

(Ezekiel 37:4) 
I said: “Lord God, only You know.”

(Ezekiel 37:5) 
And He said to me: “Prophesy to these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.’

(Ezekiel 37:6) 
“‘This is what the Lord God says to these bones: “Behold, I will send the breath of life into you, and you will live again.

(Ezekiel 37:7) 
“‘I will put sinews on you, and cause flesh to grow over you, and I will put skin on you, and I will give you My Spirit, and you will live again, and you will know that I am the Lord.”'

(Ezekiel 37:8) 
I prophesied as He commanded me, and suddenly, there was a noise and a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to bone.

(Ezekiel 37:9) 
I saw that the sinews and flesh came upon them, and skin covered them, but there was no life in them.

(Ezekiel 37:10) 
Then He said to me: “Prophesy to the Spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the Spirit: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.’

(Ezekiel 37:11) 
So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath of life came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet—a very, very great army.

(Ezekiel 37:12) 
And He said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say: ‘Our bones are dry, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.’

(Ezekiel 37:13) 
Therefore prophesy, and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I will open your graves, and I will bring you up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.’

(Ezekiel 37:14) 
“‘Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up out of your graves, O My people.

(Ezekiel 37:15) 
“‘I will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will place you in your own land; and you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it,’ says the Lord God.”

(Ezekiel 37:16) 
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 37:17) 
“Son of man, take one piece of wood and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the children of Israel associated with him.’ Then take another piece of wood and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the wood of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel associated with him.’

(Ezekiel 37:18) 
Then join them together into one piece of wood, so that they become one in your hand.

(Ezekiel 37:19) 
“And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean?’”

(Ezekiel 37:20) 
say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will give them to the wood of Judah, and I will make them one wood, and they will be one in My hand.”

(Ezekiel 37:21) 
“‘The woods on which you have written will be in their hand before their eyes.

(Ezekiel 37:22) 
“‘And say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side, and bring them into their own land.

(Ezekiel 37:23) 
“‘I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be ruler over all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they ever again be divided into two kingdoms.

(Ezekiel 37:24) 
“‘They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their abominations, or with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God.

(Ezekiel 37:25) 
“‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My judgments and keep My commandments and do them.

(Ezekiel 37:26) 
“‘They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, in which your fathers lived; and they will live in it, they and their sons and their grandsons, forever; and My servant David will be their prince forever.

(Ezekiel 37:27) 
“‘I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will plant them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.

(Ezekiel 37:28) 
“‘My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.

(Ezekiel 37:29) 
“‘And the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.’”

(Ezekiel 38:1) 
The Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Ezekiel 38:2) 
“Son of man, turn your face toward Gog in the land of Magog, the leader of the tribes of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

(Ezekiel 38:3) 
and say: ‘Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Gog, leader of the tribes of Meshech and Tubal.

(Ezekiel 38:4) 
I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws, and I will bring you out with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them fully armed, a great company with shields and bucklers, all of them bearing swords.

(Ezekiel 38:5) 
Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shields and helmets.

(Ezekiel 38:6) 
Gomer and all his troops; Beth-Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many peoples are with you.

(Ezekiel 38:7) 
Be prepared and prepare yourself, you and all your hosts that are gathered about you, and be a guard for them.

(Ezekiel 38:8) 
After many days, you shall be visited. In the latter years, you will come into the land that has been restored from the sword, gathered from many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a perpetual waste. This people has been brought out of the peoples, and they will dwell in it all.

(Ezekiel 38:9) 
And you shall ascend, and come like a storm, and like a cloud, to cover the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you.

(Ezekiel 38:10) 
Thus says the Lord God: On that day, thoughts will arise in your heart, and you will devise an evil plan.

(Ezekiel 38:11) 
And you will say: ‘I will go up to the land without walls; I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and who have no bars or gates.

(Ezekiel 38:12) 
To take spoils and seize plunder, to lay your hand on those who have been gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth.’

(Ezekiel 38:13) 
Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its young lions will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoils? Have you assembled your company to take plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, and to seize great spoils?’

(Ezekiel 38:14) 
Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: ‘Thus says the Lord God: On that day when My people Israel dwells securely, will you not know it?

(Ezekiel 38:15) 
And you will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them mounted on horses, a great company and a mighty army.

(Ezekiel 38:16) 
You will come up against My people Israel, like a cloud to cover the land. In the last days, it will be, and I will bring you against My land, when I am hallowed in you, O Gog, before the eyes of the nations.

(Ezekiel 38:17) 
Thus says the Lord God: Are you he of whom I spoke in the days of old by the hand of My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days that I would bring you against them?

(Ezekiel 38:18) 
And it will be on that day, in the days when Gog comes against the land of Israel, says the Lord God, My wrath will arise in My fury.

(Ezekiel 38:19) 
For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath, I have spoken: Surely in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 38:20) 
The fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all the creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the people who are on the face of the earth will tremble at My presence. The mountains will be thrown down, and the cliffs will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground.

(Ezekiel 38:21) 
And I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains, says the Lord God. Every man’s sword will be against his brother.

(Ezekiel 38:22) 
And I will enter into judgment with him by pestilence and by blood; and I will rain on him and his troops and on the many peoples who are with him, a torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

(Ezekiel 38:23) 
I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations. And they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 39:1) 
And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and you will say: “Thus says the Lord God: ‘Behold, I am coming against you, Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.’

(Ezekiel 39:2) 
And I will turn you around, and I will drive you, and I will bring you from the sides of the north, and I will bring you onto the mountains of Israel.

(Ezekiel 39:3) 
And I will strike your bow in your left hand, and I will break your arrows in your right hand.

(Ezekiel 39:4) 
On the mountains of Israel you will fall, and all your hosts, and the peoples who are with you: I will give you to the birds of prey of every kind, and to the beasts of the field, to be devoured.

(Ezekiel 39:5) 
You will fall on the face of the field: because I have spoken, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:6) 
And I will send fire on Magog, and on those who dwell in the isles, and they will know that I am the Lord.

(Ezekiel 39:7) 
And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not pollute my holy name any further: and the nations will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.

(Ezekiel 39:8) 
Behold, it is coming, and it is done, says the Lord God: this is the day about which I have spoken.

(Ezekiel 39:9) 
And the inhabitants will go out from the cities of Israel, and they will burn and set on fire the weapons, and the shields, and the spears, the bows and arrows, and the clubs, and all the equipment: and they will burn them with fire for seven years.

(Ezekiel 39:10) 
And they will not carry wood from the region, nor will they cut from the forests: because with the weapons they will set fire, and they will plunder those who plundered them, and they will despoil those who despoiled them, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:11) 
And it will be in that day, I will give Gog a place named a sepulcher in Israel, the valley of those traveling east of the sea, and it will strike it, and it will obstruct the way of those passing through: and they will bury there Gog, and all his multitude, and it will be called the valley of the multitude of Gog.

(Ezekiel 39:12) 
And the house of Israel will bury them, to cleanse the land, for seven months.

(Ezekiel 39:13) 
And all the people of the land will bury, and it will be to them a name: in the day when I will be glorified, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:14) 
And they will separate men who do not cease to pass through the land, and they will bury those who remain, to cleanse it: after seven months.

(Ezekiel 39:15) 
And those who pass through the land will pass through, and when they see a bone of a man, they will build a sign near it, until they cleanse the land.

(Ezekiel 39:16) 
And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God: Say to the birds and all the birds, and all the beasts of the field: Gather together, and come, assemble from all sides to my sacrifice, which I am sacrificing for you a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat the flesh, and drink the blood.

(Ezekiel 39:17) 
You will eat the flesh of the strong, and you will drink the blood of the princes of the earth: rams, lambs, and goats, and bulls, all the fat ones of Bashan.

(Ezekiel 39:18) 
And you will eat fatness until you are satisfied, and you will drink blood until you are drunk from my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you.

(Ezekiel 39:19) 
And you will be filled at my table, horse and chariot, and the strong, and all the men of war, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 39:20) 
And I will give my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see my judgment which I have made, and my hand which I have put upon them.

(Ezekiel 39:21) 
And the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God, from that day and onwards.

(Ezekiel 39:22) 
And the nations will know that in their iniquity the house of Israel was led, because they forsook me, and I hid my face from them, and I delivered them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

(Ezekiel 39:23) 
According to their impurities, and their iniquities I have done to them, and I hid my face from them.

(Ezekiel 39:24) 
Thus says the Lord God: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy on all the house of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name.

(Ezekiel 39:25) 
And they will bear their shame, and all the transgression with which they transgressed against me, when they will dwell securely in their land, and there will be no one to frighten them.

(Ezekiel 39:26) 
When I will bring them back from the peoples, and I will gather them from the lands of their enemies, and I will be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations.

(Ezekiel 39:27) 
And they will know that I am the Lord their God, who led them into captivity among the nations: and I have not left anyone of them in their land.

(Ezekiel 39:28) 
And I will no longer hide my face from them, because I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 40:1) 
In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been struck down, on that very day, the hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me there.

(Ezekiel 40:2) 
In visions of God, He brought me to the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain; on it was the structure of a city, to the south.

(Ezekiel 40:3) 
He brought me there, and behold, a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. He stood at the gate.

(Ezekiel 40:4) 
And the man spoke to me: “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and pay attention to all that I show you, for you have been brought here so that I may show you everything that you see. Announce it to the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 40:5) 
And behold, the outer wall was around the house, and in the man's hand was a measuring reed, six cubits long, by the cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the width of the structure, one reed, and the height, one reed.

(Ezekiel 40:6) 
Then he came to the gate which faced east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide, and the threshold of the other, one reed wide.

(Ezekiel 40:7) 
He measured one chamber, one reed long, and one reed wide. Between the chambers was a space of five cubits, and the threshold of the gate by the front of the vestibule of the gate inside.

(Ezekiel 40:8) 
He measured the vestibule of the gate inside, one reed.

(Ezekiel 40:9) 
He measured the vestibule of the gate, eight cubits; and its jambs were two cubits, and its pillars, two cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:10) 
In the chambers of the east gate, there were three on one side and three on the other, the same measure for the three, and the same measure for the three. The pillars of one measure on this side and on that side.

(Ezekiel 40:11) 
He measured the width of the doorway of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:12) 
And there was a barrier before each chamber, one cubit; and a chamber, one cubit; and a threshold, one cubit, next to the interior. He measured one cubit, and one cubit.

(Ezekiel 40:13) 
He measured the gate from the roof of the chambers, twenty cubits; and there were three on each side of the chamber.

(Ezekiel 40:14) 
Then he measured the pillars, sixty cubits; and beside the pillars was the court, all around the gate.

(Ezekiel 40:15) 
From the front of the gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate was sixty cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:16) 
And there were windows in its chambers, and in its pillars inside all around, and similarly in the vestibules, windows all around inside; and on the pillars were palm trees, and the measure was six cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:17) 
Then he brought me to the outer court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement of stone, laid in the court all around. There were thirty chambers on the pavement.

(Ezekiel 40:18) 
The pavement was alongside the sides of the gates, according to the length of the gates. This is the pavement.

(Ezekiel 40:19) 
Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court, one hundred cubits. And the inner court was on the east side.

(Ezekiel 40:20) 
Then he measured the gate of the outer court that faced north. He measured its length and its width.

(Ezekiel 40:21) 
Its chambers were three on each side, and its pillars and its jambs were according to the measure of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:22) 
Its windows, its vestibules, and its palm trees were according to the measure of the gate that faced east. They went up to it by seven steps, and its vestibule was before them.

(Ezekiel 40:23) 
And the gate of the inner court was opposite the north gate and the east gate. He measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:24) 
Then he brought me to the south way, and behold, the south gate. He measured its jambs and its pillars according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:25) 
And there were windows around it on both jambs, and the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:26) 
And there were seven steps by which they ascended to it, and its jambs were before them, and palm trees on its pillars on this side and on that side.

(Ezekiel 40:27) 
And there was a gate of the inner court on the south way. He measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:28) 
Then he brought me to the inner court by the south way. He measured the south gate according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:29) 
Its chambers, its pillars, and its jambs were according to these same measurements. There were windows around it and in its jambs, the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:30) 
And the jambs of the inner court were twenty-five cubits, and to the gate of the inner court, twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:31) 
And the jambs of the outer court faced east, twenty-five cubits, and he measured the pillars and the jambs according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:32) 
And there were windows around it, and in its jambs; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:33) 
The jambs of the inner court faced the east way, twenty-five cubits, and he measured the pillars and the jambs according to the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:34) 
And there were windows around it, and in its jambs; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:35) 
Then he brought me by the north way to the gate. And he measured it according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 40:36) 
Its chambers, its pillars, and its jambs, and the windows around it; the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:37) 
And its pillars were to the outer court, and palm trees on its pillars on this side and on that side, and its steps were eight.

(Ezekiel 40:38) 
And the chamber and its entrance were by the pillars; there was a washing place for washing the burnt offerings.

(Ezekiel 40:39) 
In the entrance of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which they were to slaughter the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering.

(Ezekiel 40:40) 
On the outer side, as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables, and on the other side, opposite the vestibule of the gate, were two tables.

(Ezekiel 40:41) 
There were four tables on this side and on that side, at the width of one table, and on the side of one table, on which they slaughtered.

(Ezekiel 40:42) 
And there were four stone tables for the burnt offerings, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they placed the vessels with which they slaughtered the burnt offerings and sacrifices.

(Ezekiel 40:43) 
And there were hooks, a handbreadth long, inside all around, and on the tables was the flesh of the offerings.

(Ezekiel 40:44) 
Then he brought me to the inner court, and behold, there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate, facing the south way, and one at the side of the south gate, facing the north way.

(Ezekiel 40:45) 
And he said to me: “This chamber, which faces the north way, is for the priests who keep the service of the house.

(Ezekiel 40:46) 
And the chamber which faces the south way is for the priests who keep the service of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the Lord to minister to him.”

(Ezekiel 40:47) 
Then he measured the court: one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square. And the altar was before the face of the temple.

(Ezekiel 40:48) 
Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple, and he measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side, and the width of the gate, nine cubits, and the depth of the jambs, three cubits.

(Ezekiel 40:49) 
The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width twelve cubits. They went up to it by ten steps, and the pillars were by the jambs, one on this side and one on that side.

(Ezekiel 41:1) 
Afterwards, the angel brought me into the temple, and measured the entrance halls. The width of the entrance was six cubits on one side, and six cubits on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle.

(Ezekiel 41:2) 
The entrance door was ten cubits wide, and the sides of the door were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other. He measured the length of the building, which was forty cubits, and the width, which was twenty.

(Ezekiel 41:3) 
He went inside, and measured the entrance doors, which were two cubits. The door was six cubits wide, and the width of the doors was seven cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:4) 
He measured the length, which was twenty cubits, and the width, which was twenty cubits, in front of the temple. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”

(Ezekiel 41:5) 
Afterwards, he measured the wall of the house, which was six cubits. The width of the side chambers around the house was four cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:6) 
The side chambers were in three rows, and thirty in the corners. The chambers entered into the wall of the house on the sides, to hold them in place, but they did not touch the wall of the house.

(Ezekiel 41:7) 
The side chambers went around the house, and ascended by a spiral staircase. They went around the house, and were wide because of the chambers that went around. Thus, the ascent was from the lower level to the upper level through the middle.

(Ezekiel 41:8) 
I saw also that the house had a height all around. The foundation of the side chambers, was a reed of six cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:9) 
The width of the wall outside the side chambers was five cubits, and what remained of the side chambers between them was nine cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:10) 
He measured the length of the house, which was forty cubits, and the width, which was twenty cubits. He said to me, “This is the Holy of Holies.”

(Ezekiel 41:11) 
He measured the side chambers of the house which were one hundred cubits long, and forty cubits wide in the back, and the walls all around.

(Ezekiel 41:12) 
The width of the side chambers was ten cubits underneath. The entrances to the side chambers were cubits wide, and their doors faced east, which you entered through them.

(Ezekiel 41:13) 
He said to me, “Son of man, these are the side chambers, and this is the measurement of the side chambers, which will be used.

(Ezekiel 41:14) 
He measured the width of the doors, which was twenty cubits. Before the doors there were side chambers, and the entrance went all around.

(Ezekiel 41:15) 
From the front of the entrance to the front of the inner temple, and to the wall of the house, was fifty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:16) 
There were windows in the side chambers, and also in the side chambers all around, and the windows had frames, and on the walls were engraved palm trees.

(Ezekiel 41:17) 
He led me into the outer courtyard. There were chambers and a pavement made of stone all around the courtyard; there were thirty chambers.

(Ezekiel 41:18) 
The chambers were opposite the side of the gates and opposite the way of the side chambers; there were chambers all around, and a paved area.

(Ezekiel 41:19) 
He measured the width, from the front of the inner gate to the front of the outer courtyard, which was one hundred cubits, on the east and on the north.

(Ezekiel 41:20) 
He measured the length and width of the gates of the north, which led to the outer courtyard.

(Ezekiel 41:21) 
Its windows, chambers, and palm tree decorations were according to the measure of the gate that faced east. There were seven steps, and there was an area in front of them.

(Ezekiel 41:22) 
Then he entered into the inner courtyard and measured the same gate.

(Ezekiel 41:23) 
There was a gate to the inner courtyard opposite the north gate, and also facing the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate, which was one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:24) 
He brought me to the way to the south, and behold, the gate to the south, and he measured its entrance halls, and its side chambers, according to the same measurements as before.

(Ezekiel 41:25) 
There were windows in it, and the side chambers all around, just like the former windows. The length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:26) 
The steps went up through it, and there was a staircase in the way. The windows were all around: the length was fifty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:27) 
The gate of the inner courtyard faced the way to the south, and he measured from the gate to the gate to the south, which was one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 41:28) 
He brought me into the inner courtyard by the way to the south, and measured according to these measurements.

(Ezekiel 41:29) 
The side chambers, the entrance halls, and the side chambers were according to these same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:1) 
After these things, the angel brought me to the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 42:2) 
And look—the glory of the God of Israel arrived from the east. His voice sounded like the noise of many waters, and the whole earth shone with His glory.

(Ezekiel 42:3) 
The vision I saw resembled the one I had seen when I came to destroy the city. It also looked like the vision I had seen near the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.

(Ezekiel 42:4) 
Then the glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 42:5) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courts. And look—the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

(Ezekiel 42:6) 
I saw a man standing beside the temple. He held a measuring line made of linen in his hand. The man measured the length of the building, which was six cubits. The breadth of the building was six cubits in width.

(Ezekiel 42:7) 
Then he measured the width of the entrance, three cubits, and the width of the doorways, three cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:9) 
He measured the wall of the temple: two cubits. The width of the building was six cubits, and the breadth of the chambers was seven cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:10) 
He measured the chambers: twenty cubits, and twenty cubits in breadth, opposite the temple. And he said to me:

(Ezekiel 42:11) 
“These chambers facing north are the holy chambers. The priests who offer the holy sacrifices of the sons of Zadok, who guard My sanctuary, will eat there. They will eat the most holy offerings in these chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:12) 
The priests who enter these chambers can go in, but they cannot leave the holy place to enter the outer court. Rather, they will leave their priestly garments there, where they serve, because the garments are holy. They will put on other garments before going out to the people.”

(Ezekiel 42:13) 
He measured the temple: one hundred cubits long, and one hundred cubits in length.

(Ezekiel 42:14) 
He also measured the sides of the building all around: one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:15) 
He measured the length of the building that faced the empty space on both sides, one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:16) 
He measured the length of the building that faced the empty space behind it, and the galleries on this and that side, one hundred cubits. And the inner temple and the vestibules of the court were included.

(Ezekiel 42:17) 
Outside of the vestibule, the outer court extended around, and around the court were thirty chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:18) 
The walls between the chambers had windows, and the chambers had windows all around facing the chambers. The walls were decorated with the carvings of palm trees.

(Ezekiel 42:19) 
The outer court faced the road into the chambers to the square. The faces were positioned opposite one another, facing the road of the chambers.

(Ezekiel 42:20) 
He measured the gate of the outer court that faced north. He measured its length, its breadth, its windows, and its palm trees. These were measured according to the measurements of the gate that faced east. One could ascend into it by seven steps.

(Ezekiel 42:21) 
He measured its length: one hundred cubits, and its breadth: fifty cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:22) 
The windows, the palm trees, and the decorations were according to the measurements of the gate that faced east. One ascended into it by seven steps, and there was a vestibule in front of them.

(Ezekiel 42:23) 
There was a gate of the inner court opposite the northern gate and the eastern gate, and he measured from gate to gate: one hundred cubits.

(Ezekiel 42:24) 
Then he led me to the southern side, and look—there was the southern gate. He measured its doorways and its posts, following the same measurements as before.

(Ezekiel 42:25) 
There were windows and palm trees on either side of it, and they were according to the measurements of the other gates.

The gate of the inner court was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits broad, and chambers were in front of it.

(Ezekiel 42:31) 
The outer court’s gate was on the southern side, and there were palm trees on its posts. Its ascent was by eight steps.

(Ezekiel 42:38) 
At the entrance of the gate were two tables, upon which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were sacrificed.

(Ezekiel 42:39) 
On the outer wall, at the entrance of the gate, were two tables, and on the wall of the gate were two tables where the sacrifices were made.

(Ezekiel 42:40) 
At the entrance of the gate that faced north, there were two tables. Two tables were also at the entrance of the gate that faced south.

(Ezekiel 42:41) 
On both sides of the gate’s wall were four tables. The tables were four cubits long, and the tables were one and a half cubits wide.

(Ezekiel 42:42) 
The tables for the burnt offerings were one and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. The tables were for the vessels used to slaughter the sacrifices.

(Ezekiel 42:43) 
There were hooks of one cubit, placed all around the inner edge of the walls. Upon the tables was the meat of the offerings.

(Ezekiel 42:44) 
He then led me into the inner court, and look—there were tables in the inner court, on both sides of the entrance of the temple.

(Ezekiel 42:45) 
And he said to me, “This table is before the face of the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 42:46) 
Then he led me into the outer court. He led me through the four corners of the court. And look—in each corner of the court was a court.

(Ezekiel 42:47) 
In the corners of the court were cloisters forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. The measurements of the four corners were the same.

(Ezekiel 42:48) 
In each corner of the court there were also buildings thirty cubits wide and forty cubits long. These four had the same measurements.

(Ezekiel 42:49) 
He entered the vestibule of the gate and measured the gate: twelve cubits high, and six cubits wide.

(Ezekiel 43:1) 
And the angel brought me to the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:2) 
And I looked, and the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. The sound was like the sound of many waters, and the land shone because of his glory.

(Ezekiel 43:3) 
The vision I saw was like the vision I had when I came to destroy the city. The vision was like the one I saw near the river Chebar, and I fell to the ground.

(Ezekiel 43:4) 
And the glory of the Lord came into the temple by the gate facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:5) 
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and I saw that the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

(Ezekiel 43:6) 
I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple, and a man was standing beside me.

(Ezekiel 43:7) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of my feet, where I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will not defile my holy name again, neither they, nor their kings, by their acts of sexual immorality, nor by the dead bodies of their kings, nor by their high places.

(Ezekiel 43:8) 
They placed their threshold next to my threshold, and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, so that they defiled my holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore, I consumed them in my wrath.

(Ezekiel 43:9) 
Now let them put away their sexual immorality and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell among them forever.

(Ezekiel 43:10) 
Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, and let them be ashamed of their sins, and let them measure the design.

(Ezekiel 43:11) 
And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and entrances, its entire design, all its regulations, and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may observe its entire design, all its regulations, and perform them.

(Ezekiel 43:12) 
This is the law of the temple: The entire area surrounding the summit of the mountain is most holy. So, this is the law of the temple.

(Ezekiel 43:13) 
These are the measurements of the altar in cubits, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. The base of the altar is one cubit high, and its width is one cubit. The rim around it is one handbreadth wide, and this is the height of the altar.

(Ezekiel 43:14) 
From the base of the altar to the lower ledge, two cubits high, and one cubit wide. From the small ledge to the large ledge, four cubits high, and one cubit wide.

(Ezekiel 43:15) 
The altar is four cubits high, and from the altar itself, four horns.

(Ezekiel 43:16) 
The altar is twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide, forming a square at its four corners.

(Ezekiel 43:17) 
The ledge is fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide at its four corners. The rim around it is half a cubit, and its base is one cubit around. Its steps face east.

(Ezekiel 43:18) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: These are the steps that lead to the inner court and the outer court, where the priests, who are the gatekeepers, will be facing east.

(Ezekiel 43:19) 
And he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: If the prince gives a gift from the sons of Israel, he must offer a sacrifice for it before the Lord, and he shall make these offerings.

(Ezekiel 43:20) 
The priests will offer an oblation of a holocaust and peace offerings, and they will worship me upon the altar, and they will sacrifice for them.

(Ezekiel 43:21) 
When the prince offers an oblation, he must enter by the way of the court that faces east and offer the holocaust and peace offerings, as he usually does.

(Ezekiel 43:22) 
He will do this in the gateway, and he will offer the holocaust and peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 43:23) 
On the Sabbath day, he shall offer a holocaust of a perfect young bull, six rams, and unblemished rams.

(Ezekiel 43:24) 
On the first day of each month, he will offer a perfect young bull from the herd, and six unblemished lambs from the flock.

(Ezekiel 43:25) 
And he shall offer the holocaust and the peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 43:26) 
On the first day of each month, he will offer a perfect young bull from the herd, and six unblemished lambs from the flock.

(Ezekiel 43:27) 
And he shall offer the holocaust and the peace offerings before the Lord.

(Ezekiel 44:1) 
Then the Lord brought me back to the way of the outer sanctuary’s gate, which faces east: and it was closed.

(Ezekiel 44:2) 
The Lord said to me, “Son of man, this is the gate by which the princes will enter, so they may eat food before the Lord. They will enter through the vestibule of the gate, and they will exit through the same way.”

(Ezekiel 44:3) 
Then the Lord brought me by the north gate in front of the house: and I saw, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house, and I fell on my face.

(Ezekiel 44:4) 
The Lord said to me, “Son of man, note and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears everything that I speak to you concerning all of the ceremonies of the Lord’s house, and all of its laws. Pay close attention to the entrance to the house, along with all the exits of the sanctuary.”

(Ezekiel 44:5) 
Then you shall say to the house of Israel, who have rebelled: “These are the words of the Lord God: ‘Let all your abominations be enough for you, house of Israel,

(Ezekiel 44:6) 
because you have brought in the foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary and contaminate my house. You have offered my bread, the fat, and the blood. You have broken my covenant by all your abominations.

(Ezekiel 44:7) 
You have not kept my holy ordinances, but you have appointed others to be the keepers of my observances in my sanctuary for you.

(Ezekiel 44:8) 
These are the words of the Lord God: “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter my sanctuary, out of all the foreigners who are among the children of Israel.

(Ezekiel 44:9) 
“But the Levites who departed from me, when Israel went astray, and went after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 44:10) 
They will be ministers in my sanctuary, and keepers of the gates of the house, and ministers in the house: they themselves will slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices of the people, and they shall stand before them, in order to minister to them.

(Ezekiel 44:11) 
Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel: therefore, I raised my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity.

(Ezekiel 44:12) 
They will not approach me to function as priests to me, nor to any of my holy things, nor to the most holy things: but they will bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

(Ezekiel 44:13) 
And I will give them to be the keepers of the house’s observances, in all its ministry, and in all things that are done in it.

(Ezekiel 44:14) 
“But the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept the ceremonies of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall approach me, to minister to me, and they shall stand before me, to offer me fat and blood, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 44:15) 
“They shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and keep my observances.

(Ezekiel 44:16) 
“When they enter the gate of the inner court, they will wear linen tunics, and they will not put on anything that causes sweat, when they minister in the gate of the inner court and inside.

(Ezekiel 44:17) 
“They will have linen helmets on their heads, and linen breeches will be put on: they will not gird themselves in sweat.

(Ezekiel 44:18) 
“When they go out to the outer court to the people, they will take off their garments in which they ministered, and cover themselves with other clothes: so they do not sanctify the people in their garments.

(Ezekiel 44:19) 
“They will not shave their heads, nor will they let their hair grow long, but they will trim their heads.

(Ezekiel 44:20) 
“No priest shall drink wine when they are about to enter the inner court.

(Ezekiel 44:21) 
“They will not take a widow or a divorced woman for a wife, but they will take virgins of the house of Israel’s seed, or those who have fallen from the widowhood of the priests.

(Ezekiel 44:22) 
“They shall teach the people what is between the holy and the profane, and what is between the polluted and the clean they shall show to them.

(Ezekiel 44:23) 
“And in a matter of judgment they shall stand, and they shall judge according to my judgments: and they will keep my laws and my ordinances in all my solemnities, and they shall sanctify my Sabbaths.

(Ezekiel 44:24) 
“They will not enter to a dead person, lest they become contaminated, but they will be contaminated in their father and in their mother, and in their son and in their daughter, brother and sister, when they die.

(Ezekiel 44:25) 
“And after they are purified, they will count for seven days.

(Ezekiel 44:26) 
“On the day that they enter into the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, they shall offer for their sin, says the Lord God.

(Ezekiel 44:27) 
“It shall be for them as an inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you will not give them a possession in Israel: for I am their possession.

(Ezekiel 44:28) 
“They will eat the offering for sin, and for the offense, and every vow in Israel shall be theirs.

(Ezekiel 44:29) 
“And everything that is offered from the firstfruits and from all that is vowed, shall be theirs.

(Ezekiel 44:30) 
“The firstfruits of all your produce, and everything that is offered as a gift of your hands, shall be for the priests: and you will give the firstfruits of your flour to the priest, and he shall bless your house.

(Ezekiel 44:31) 
“The priests shall not eat anything that has died a natural death, or has been torn to pieces, whether birds or animals.

(Ezekiel 45:1) 
When you divide the land, set aside a portion for the Lord, making it holy.

(Ezekiel 45:2) 
The length will be twenty-five thousand units of measure, and the width ten thousand. This area will be holy on all sides.

(Ezekiel 45:3) 
You will measure out of this area a length of twenty-five thousand units of measure, and a width of ten thousand. There will be the holy sanctuary and the holiest of holies there.

(Ezekiel 45:4) 
The holy part of the land will be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who serve the Lord. It will be their place for houses and holy places for the sanctuary.

(Ezekiel 45:5) 
Twenty-five thousand units of measure in length, and ten thousand in width, will be for the Levites, who minister in the house. They will possess twenty chambers.

(Ezekiel 45:6) 
You will give the city's possession a width of five thousand units of measure, and a length of twenty-five thousand, next to the holy portion, for all the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:7) 
You will give to the prince from both sides of the sanctuary's possession and the city's possession, before the separation of the sanctuary and the city's possession, from the west side to the east side. The prince will be in the possession on both sides of the borders.

(Ezekiel 45:8) 
He will possess land. My princes will not spoil my people's possession any further. But they will give the possession to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.

(Ezekiel 45:9) 
This is what the Lord God says: “Enough, you leaders of Israel! Stop your violence and robbery! Do what is just and right. Stop oppressing my people,

(Ezekiel 45:10) 
Use an honest balance, an honest ephah, and an honest bath. The ephah and the bath will have the same measure, able to hold a tenth of a homer.

(Ezekiel 45:11) 
This is the measure: The ephah and the bath are one unit. The homer is ten ephahs.

(Ezekiel 45:12) 
The sixth part of the ephah is equal to one homer. One sixth of a bath is one measure, according to the bath.

(Ezekiel 45:13) 
This is the offering you are to present: one sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.

(Ezekiel 45:14) 
The portion of oil will be one bath of oil for every ten baths of the homer, because ten baths make a homer.

(Ezekiel 45:15) 
You must sacrifice one sheep from every two hundred in the pastures of Israel, for a sin offering, and a burnt offering, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them,

(Ezekiel 45:16) 
All the people of the land will give this holy offering to the leaders of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:17) 
It will be the prince's duty to provide the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings, at the festivals, the Sabbaths, and the new moons, at all the festivals of the house of Israel. He will make the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.

(Ezekiel 45:18) 
This is what the Lord God says: “In the first month, on the first day of the month, you must take a young, perfect bull, and purify the sanctuary.

(Ezekiel 45:19) 
The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, on the four corners of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate of the inner court.

(Ezekiel 45:20) 
You must do the same on the seventh day of the month, for anyone who has made a mistake or is ignorant, to make atonement for the house.

(Ezekiel 45:21) 
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you will have the Passover, a seven-day festival, and you will eat unleavened bread.

(Ezekiel 45:22) 
The prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.

(Ezekiel 45:23) 
During the seven days of the festival, the prince will provide a burnt offering to the Lord: seven young, perfect bulls and seven perfect rams each day, and a male goat each day, as a sin offering.

(Ezekiel 45:24) 
He will provide a grain offering and a drink offering with each burnt offering for seven days. He will provide the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the oil for a drink offering.

(Ezekiel 45:25) 
In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the festival, he will do the same for seven days, according to the law of the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the oil for a drink offering.

(Ezekiel 46:1) 
The Lord God says, “The inner gate of the east court will be shut for six days a week. But on the Sabbath, it will be opened; and it will also be opened on the first day of the month.

(Ezekiel 46:2) 
The prince will enter through the entrance of the outer gate, and he will stand in the vestibule of the gate. He will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He will worship at the threshold of the gate. He will exit, and the gate will not be shut until evening.

(Ezekiel 46:3) 
The people of the land will worship at the entrance to that gate, in the presence of the Lord, on the Sabbaths and on the first day of the month.

(Ezekiel 46:4) 
The burnt offering that the prince offers to the Lord on the Sabbath will be six unblemished rams and one unblemished ram.

(Ezekiel 46:5) 
He will offer a grain offering of one ephah for the ram, and he will offer a grain offering as much as he is able for the rams, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:6) 
On the first day of the month, he will offer a young, unblemished bull, six unblemished lambs, and one unblemished ram.

(Ezekiel 46:7) 
He will offer a grain offering of one ephah for the bull, one ephah for the ram. And for the lambs, he will offer whatever he is able, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:8) 
When the prince enters, he will enter by the way of the vestibule, and he will exit by the same way.

(Ezekiel 46:9) 
When the people of the land come before the Lord during the feasts, the one who enters by way of the north gate to worship will exit by way of the south gate. The one who enters by the south gate will exit by the north gate. They will not return by the way of the gate by which they entered, but they will exit opposite it.

(Ezekiel 46:10) 
The prince will enter in their midst when they enter, and when they exit. The gate will not be shut.

(Ezekiel 46:11) 
Also during the festivals and solemnities, the offering will be one ephah for a bull, and one ephah for a ram. For the lambs, it will be as much as he is able, and one hin of oil for each ephah.

(Ezekiel 46:12) 
When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offerings, the gate that faces east will be opened for him. He will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, just as he does on the Sabbath. He will exit, and after he has exited, the gate will be shut.

(Ezekiel 46:13) 
Each day, you will offer a burnt offering to the Lord, a one-year-old, unblemished lamb. You will offer it in the morning.

(Ezekiel 46:14) 
You will offer a grain offering with it in the morning, a sixth part of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to mix with the flour, as a grain offering to the Lord, always by right.

(Ezekiel 46:15) 
They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning, as a perpetual burnt offering.

(Ezekiel 46:16) 
The Lord God says: “If the prince gives a gift to one of his sons, it will be the inheritance of his sons. He will possess it as his inheritance.

(Ezekiel 46:17) 
But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to him until the year of remission. It will return to the prince. The inheritance will be for his sons.

(Ezekiel 46:18) 
He will not take from the people’s inheritance to expel them from their possession, but from his own possession he will inherit his inheritance for his sons.”

(Ezekiel 46:19) 
He led me through the way that was next to the gate, to the treasury of the sanctuary of the priests, which faced north. There was a place there at its side, facing west.

(Ezekiel 46:20) 
He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will cook the sin offering and the trespass offering. They will cook it so that they do not transfer it into the court of the people.”

(Ezekiel 46:21) 
Then he led me into the outer court and led me around the four corners of the court. There was a court in the corner of the court.

(Ezekiel 46:22) 
In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide. The measure was the same in all four.

(Ezekiel 46:23) 
There was a structure around all of them. Under the courts, there was a structure around them. There was a place for cooking under the structure around.

(Ezekiel 46:24) 
He said to me: “These are the kitchens, where those who minister in the house will cook.”

(Ezekiel 47:1) 
Then he led me back to the door of the temple, and I saw water flowing out from beneath the threshold of the temple toward the east. (For the façade of the temple looked toward the east.) The water came down from the right side of the temple toward the south.

(Ezekiel 47:2) 
And he led me through the way of the north gate and went around me outside to the outer gate to the road facing east. And I saw the water flowing from the right side.

(Ezekiel 47:3) 
The man who had a measuring line in his hand went east. He measured a thousand cubits and then led me through the water, and the water reached my ankles.

(Ezekiel 47:4) 
Then he measured another thousand cubits and led me through the water, and the water reached my knees.

(Ezekiel 47:5) 
He measured another thousand cubits and led me through the water, and the water reached my waist.

(Ezekiel 47:6) 
He measured another thousand cubits, and it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen to such a height that it was deep enough to swim in. It was a river that could not be crossed.

(Ezekiel 47:7) 
He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river.

(Ezekiel 47:8) 
And when I had returned, I saw many trees on both sides of the river.

(Ezekiel 47:9) 
And he said to me, “These waters that are flowing toward the east and descending into the desert will enter the sea and be cast out, and the waters of the sea will be healed.

(Ezekiel 47:10) 
“Wherever the river flows, every living creature that swarms there will live. There will be great numbers of fish, for these waters flow there and the sea will be healed. And everything will live wherever the river goes.

(Ezekiel 47:11) 
“Fishermen will stand beside the sea from Engedi to Eneglaim. They will be places for spreading nets. Their fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.

(Ezekiel 47:12) 
“But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.

(Ezekiel 47:13) 
“On both banks of the river there will grow all kinds of fruit trees. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.”

(Ezekiel 47:14) 
Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, I will visit you, and I will gather you from the nations, and I will bring you home from the lands where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

(Ezekiel 47:15) 
“You will come home, and you will remove all of your abominations and all of your offenses.

(Ezekiel 47:16) 
“I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the stony heart from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

(Ezekiel 47:17) 
“I will put My Spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in My statutes and be careful to observe My judgments.

(Ezekiel 47:18) 
“You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you will be My people, and I will be your God.”

(Ezekiel 47:19) 
“And I will deliver you from all your uncleanness. And I will call for the grain and multiply it and will bring no famine on you.

(Ezekiel 47:20) 
“I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field, so that you will not suffer reproach among the nations because of famine.

(Ezekiel 47:21) 
“Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will despise yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.

(Ezekiel 47:22) 
“Not for your sake do I do this, says the Lord God; let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.”

(Ezekiel 47:23) 
Thus says the Lord God: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.

(Ezekiel 47:24) 
“And the land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being desolate in the sight of everyone who passes by.

(Ezekiel 47:25) 
“And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the cities that were ruined, desolate, and destroyed are fortified.’

(Ezekiel 47:26) 
“Then the nations that are left all around you will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.”

(Ezekiel 47:27) 
Thus says the Lord God: “In addition to this, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do this for them: I will increase their numbers like a flock of people.

(Ezekiel 47:28) 
“Like the flock for the holy days, like the flock of Jerusalem at its appointed feasts, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”

(Ezekiel 48:1) 
These are the tribes of the sons of Israel. Each will have a gate of its own.

(Ezekiel 48:2) 
From the northern boundary, the length begins at the road of Hethalon, to the entrance of Emath, and at the boundary of Damascus, near the road of Emath. The eastern and western boundaries are Dan.

(Ezekiel 48:3) 
Near the border of Dan, on the east side, to the sea, Asher will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:4) 
Near the border of Asher, on the east side, to the sea, Naphtali will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:5) 
Near the border of Naphtali, on the east side, to the sea, Manasseh will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:6) 
Near the border of Manasseh, on the east side, to the sea, Ephraim will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:7) 
Near the border of Ephraim, on the east side, to the sea, Reuben will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:8) 
Near the border of Reuben, on the east side, to the sea, Judah will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:9) 
Near the border of Judah, on the east side, to the sea, this is the portion you shall set aside.

(Ezekiel 48:10) 
The sacred portion will be twenty-five thousand units long, and ten thousand units wide. This will be the priests' part.

(Ezekiel 48:11) 
This is the portion for the priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept my ceremonies and did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.

(Ezekiel 48:12) 
It will be their sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, near the border of the Levites.

(Ezekiel 48:13) 
The Levites will have a portion near the priests' borders, twenty-five thousand units long, and ten thousand units wide.

(Ezekiel 48:14) 
They may not sell or exchange any of it, nor transfer the first fruits of the land, for they are sanctified to the Lord.

(Ezekiel 48:15) 
The rest, which remains in width, will be five thousand units. It will be for the city, for dwellings and suburbs. The city will be in their midst.

(Ezekiel 48:16) 
This is the city's measurement: on the north side, four thousand five hundred; on the south, four thousand five hundred; on the east, four thousand five hundred; and on the west, four thousand five hundred.

(Ezekiel 48:17) 
The city's suburbs will be: on the north side, two hundred and fifty units; on the south side, two hundred and fifty; on the east side, two hundred and fifty; and on the west, two hundred and fifty.

(Ezekiel 48:18) 
The rest of the length, according to the measurement of the holy portion, will be ten thousand units on the east, and ten thousand on the west, and its fruit will be for food for the city.

(Ezekiel 48:19) 
Those who work in the city will work from all the tribes of Israel.

(Ezekiel 48:20) 
All the portions, twenty-five thousand units in length, and ten thousand in width, will be from the sacred portion.

(Ezekiel 48:21) 
The remaining portion, from the portion of the priests and the Levites, will belong to the leaders, twenty-five thousand units in length and ten thousand in width. Their portion will be holy.

(Ezekiel 48:22) 
From the possession of the Levites and the priests, it will be in the middle, and it will be between the borders of Judah and Benjamin.

(Ezekiel 48:23) 
As for the other tribes, from the east side to the sea, Benjamin will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:24) 
Near the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the sea, Simeon will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:25) 
Near the border of Simeon, from the east side to the sea, Issachar will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:26) 
Near the border of Issachar, from the east side to the sea, Zebulun will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:27) 
Near the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the sea, Gad will have its land.

(Ezekiel 48:28) 
Near the border of Gad, towards the south, the border will be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, and to the torrent, to the great sea.

(Ezekiel 48:29)
