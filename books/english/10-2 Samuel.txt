(2 Samuel 1:1) 
Now, after King Saul had died, David returned from his victory over the Amalekites. He then remained in Ziklag for two days.

(2 Samuel 1:2) 
On the third day, a man appeared, coming from Saul's military camp. His clothes were torn, and dust covered his head, showing his distress and mourning. When he came to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself in homage.

(2 Samuel 1:3) 
David asked him: "Where do you come from?" And the man replied: "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."

(2 Samuel 1:4) 
And David asked him: "What is this news you bring, what has happened? Tell me." The man said: "The people have fled from the battle, and many have fallen and died. Even King Saul and his son Jonathan have perished."

(2 Samuel 1:5) 
David then asked the young man who was reporting this to him: "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"

(2 Samuel 1:6) 
And the young man who was bringing him the news said: "By chance, I came upon Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul, leaning upon his spear. The chariots and horsemen of the enemy were drawing closer to him."

(2 Samuel 1:7) 
When Saul looked behind himself, he saw me and called out. When I answered him, saying, 'Here I am,' he spoke to me, saying: 'Kill me, for I am in great distress, and yet my life is still in me.'"

(2 Samuel 1:8) 
He said to me: 'Who are you?' And I said to him: 'I am an Amalekite.'

(2 Samuel 1:9) 
And he spoke to me, saying: 'Kill me, for I am in great distress, and yet my life is still in me.'

(2 Samuel 1:10) 
So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he could not survive his fall. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."

(2 Samuel 1:11) 
Then David seized his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did likewise as a sign of deep mourning.

(2 Samuel 1:12) 
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening over Saul, and over his son Jonathan, and over the people of the Lord, and over the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword in battle.

(2 Samuel 1:13) 
Then David asked the young man who had brought him the news: "Where are you from?" He replied: "I am the son of a foreign man, an Amalekite."

(2 Samuel 1:14) 
And David said to him: "Why were you not afraid to lay your hand on the Lord's anointed and kill him?" This means David was asking why the man wasn't afraid to violate God's sacred order.

(2 Samuel 1:15) 
Then David called one of his young men and said: "Go near and execute him." So the young man struck him down, and he died.

(2 Samuel 1:16) 
And David said to the Amalekite: "Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth testified against you when you said: 'I killed the Lord's anointed.'"

(2 Samuel 1:17) 
Then David chanted this lament over Saul and over his son Jonathan.

(2 Samuel 1:18) 
And he commanded that the children of Judah be taught this lament, which is recorded in the Book of Jashar, a collection of heroic deeds.

(2 Samuel 1:19) 
O, the glory of Israel lies slain upon your mountains, O Gilboa! How have the mighty fallen?

(2 Samuel 1:20) 
Do not declare it in Gath, nor announce it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

(2 Samuel 1:21) 
O mountains of Gilboa, may no dew or rain fall upon you, nor may there be fields that yield first fruits. For there, the shield of the mighty was cast away, the shield of Saul, as if it had never been anointed with oil for battle.

(2 Samuel 1:22) 
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty warriors, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back without striking, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.

(2 Samuel 1:23) 
Saul and Jonathan, beloved and beautiful in their lives, even in death they were not separated. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.

(2 Samuel 1:24) 
O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.

(2 Samuel 1:25) 
How have the mighty fallen in battle? Jonathan lies slain on your high places.

(2 Samuel 1:26) 
I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan. You were exceedingly delightful to me, and your love for me was more precious than the love of women. Just as a mother loves her only son, so I cherished you.

(2 Samuel 1:27) 
How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished?

(2 Samuel 1:1) 
After Saul had died, David returned from his conquest of the Amalekites, and he stayed in Ziklag for two days.

(2 Samuel 1:2) 
And on the third day, a man appeared. He was coming from Saul's camp. His clothes were torn, and his head was covered with dust. When he came to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself in homage.

(2 Samuel 1:3) 
David asked him, "Where are you coming from?" The man replied to him, "I have fled from the camp of Israel."

(2 Samuel 1:4) 
David said to him, "What news has happened? Tell me." The man replied, "The people have fled from the battle, and many have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."

(2 Samuel 1:5) 
David said to the young man who was bringing him the news, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"

(2 Samuel 1:6) 
The young man who was bringing the news said, "By chance, I came upon Mount Gilboa. Saul was leaning upon his spear, while chariots and horsemen were drawing near to him."

(2 Samuel 1:7) 
"When he looked behind himself, he saw me and called out. I replied, 'Here I am.'"

(2 Samuel 1:8) 
"He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'"

(2 Samuel 1:9) 
"He said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me, because great anguish holds me, and my life is still completely within me.'"

(2 Samuel 1:10) 
"So, standing over him, I killed him, for I knew that he could not live after his fall. I then took the crown from his head and the armlet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."

(2 Samuel 1:11) 
Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them. All the men who were with him did the same.

(2 Samuel 1:12) 
They lamented and wept and fasted until evening over Saul, and over his son Jonathan, and over the Lord's people, and over the house of Israel, because they had died in battle.

(2 Samuel 1:13) 
David then said to the young man who had brought him the news, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."

(2 Samuel 1:14) 
David said to him, "Why did you not fear to stretch out your hand to kill the Lord's anointed?"

(2 Samuel 1:15) 
Then David called one of his young men, saying, "Come here and strike him down." The young man struck him, and he died.

(2 Samuel 1:16) 
David said to him, "Your blood is upon your own head. For your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the Lord's anointed.'"

(2 Samuel 1:17) 
David then uttered this lamentation over Saul and over his son Jonathan:

(2 Samuel 1:18) 
He commanded that the sons of Judah should be taught this lamentation, called 'the Bow.' Indeed, it is written in the Book of Jashar:

(2 Samuel 1:19) 
"The glory of Israel is slain upon your mountains! How have the mighty fallen!"

(2 Samuel 1:20) 
"Do not announce it in Gath, nor proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."

(2 Samuel 1:21) 
"O mountains of Gilboa, may no dew nor rain come upon you, nor fields that bear offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was cast away—the shield of Saul, as if he had not been anointed with oil."

(2 Samuel 1:22) 
"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the arrow of Jonathan never returned without striking, and the sword of Saul never returned empty."

(2 Samuel 1:23) 
"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and beautiful in their lives, in death also they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, and stronger than lions."

(2 Samuel 1:24) 
"O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in luxurious scarlet and provided golden ornaments for your garments."

(2 Samuel 1:25) 
"How have the mighty fallen in battle! Jonathan is slain upon your high places!"

(2 Samuel 1:26) 
"I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan, most beautiful, and more beloved than all the love of women, a love that surpassed even romantic love."

(2 Samuel 1:27) 
"How have the mighty fallen, and how have the weapons of war perished!"

(2 Samuel 2:1) 
After this, David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said to him: "Go up." Then David asked again: "Where should I go up?" And the Lord answered him: "To Hebron."

(2 Samuel 2:2) 
So David went up there, along with his two wives: Achinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel.

(2 Samuel 2:3) 
And David also brought the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in the cities around Hebron.

(2 Samuel 2:4) 
Then the men of Judah came and anointed David there to reign over the house of Judah. And it was reported to David that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had buried Saul.

(2 Samuel 2:5) 
So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them: "May you be blessed by the Lord, because you showed this kindness to your lord Saul by burying him."

(2 Samuel 2:6) 
And now, may the Lord repay you with kindness and truth. And I myself will also reward you with good because you have done this deed.

(2 Samuel 2:7) 
Therefore, strengthen your hands and be courageous men, for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.

(2 Samuel 2:8) 
However, Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and brought him into a fortified camp.

(2 Samuel 2:9) 
And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all of Israel.

(2 Samuel 2:10) 
Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.

(2 Samuel 2:11) 
And the number of days that David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

(2 Samuel 2:12) 
Then Abner, the son of Ner, and the men of Ishbosheth, Saul's son, went out from the fortified camp to Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 2:13) 
And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and David's men went out from Hebron. They met them by the pool of Gibeon, and when they had gathered in one place, some sat on one side of the pool, and the others sat on the opposite side.

(2 Samuel 2:14) 
Then Abner said to Joab: "Let the young men rise up and fight before us." And Joab answered: "Let them rise up."

(2 Samuel 2:15) 
So they rose up: twelve men chosen by David, and twelve men from Benjamin who fought for Ishbosheth, Saul's son.

(2 Samuel 2:16) 
And each man grasped his opponent's head and thrust his sword into his adversary, and they all fell down together. So the name of that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 2:17) 
And a very fierce battle took place on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were struck down by David's men.

(2 Samuel 2:18) 
Now there were three sons of Zeruiah there: Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as swift of foot as one of the wild gazelles.

(2 Samuel 2:19) 
Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left, following closely behind Abner.

(2 Samuel 2:20) 
So Abner turned around, looking back, and said: "Are you Asahel?" And he answered: "I am."

(2 Samuel 2:21) 
And Abner said to him: "Turn away from pursuing me and seize one of the younger men, and take his spoils for yourself." But Asahel would not leave him, but continued to press after him.

(2 Samuel 2:22) 
Again Abner spoke to Asahel, saying: "Turn away, do not pursue me, lest I be compelled to strike you down to the ground. Then I would not be able to look your brother Joab in the face."

(2 Samuel 2:23) 
But Asahel, refusing to turn away, was struck by Abner in the stomach, below the armpit, and died there. And everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died stopped.

(2 Samuel 2:24) 
Then Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. When the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is opposite the valley and the road to the desert of Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 2:25) 
However, the sons of Benjamin gathered together with Abner and formed a single company, standing on the top of a hill.

(2 Samuel 2:26) 
Then Abner cried out to Joab and said: "Will your sword rage until complete destruction? Do you not know that desperation is dangerous? How long will you not tell the people to stop pursuing their brothers?"

(2 Samuel 2:27) 
And Joab said: "As the Lord lives, if you had spoken, all the people would have stopped pursuing their brothers from early morning."

(2 Samuel 2:28) 
Then Joab blew the trumpet, and all the army stopped. They no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight any more.

(2 Samuel 2:29) 
But Abner and his men marched through the plain all that night. They crossed the Jordan, and after passing through all of Beth-horon, they came to their fortified camp.

(2 Samuel 2:30) 
Joab also returned, abandoning the pursuit of Abner, and gathered all the army. Nineteen men from David's followers were missing, besides Asahel.

(2 Samuel 2:31) 
However, David's men had struck down three hundred and sixty men from Benjamin and from Abner's men, all of whom died.

(2 Samuel 2:32) 
And they took Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night, and dawn broke for them in Hebron.

(2 Samuel 2:1) 
After these events, David sought guidance from the Lord, asking, 'Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?' And the Lord spoke to him, saying, 'Go up.' David then asked, 'Where should I go up?' And the Lord said, 'To Hebron.'

(2 Samuel 2:2) 
So David went up, along with his two wives: Ahinoam, the woman from Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

(2 Samuel 2:3) 
David also brought the men who were with him, each with their own household, and they settled in the various towns within the region of Hebron.

(2 Samuel 2:4) 
Then the men of Judah came and anointed David there to be king over the house of Judah. And it was reported to David that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had buried Saul.

(2 Samuel 2:5) 
So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said to them: 'May you be blessed by the Lord, you who have shown such loyalty to your lord Saul, by burying him.'

(2 Samuel 2:6) 
And now, may the Lord repay you with His grace and faithfulness. Indeed, I myself will also reward you with good, because you have done this deed.

(2 Samuel 2:7) 
Therefore, strengthen your hands, and be strong, courageous men. For your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.

(2 Samuel 2:8) 
Now Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, and brought him through the encampments of Israel.

(2 Samuel 2:9) 
And Abner made Ishbosheth king over Gilead, and over the Geshurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all of the tribes of Israel outside of Judah.

(2 Samuel 2:10) 
Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.

(2 Samuel 2:11) 
And the total number of days that David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

(2 Samuel 2:12) 
Then Abner, the son of Ner, along with the servants of Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 2:13) 
And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, along with David’s servants, went out from Hebron. They met Abner and his men by the Pool of Gibeon, and they sat down, some on one side of the pool, and some on the other.

(2 Samuel 2:14) 
And Abner said to Joab, 'Let the young men rise and play a contest before us.' And Joab responded, 'Let them rise.'

(2 Samuel 2:15) 
So they rose and passed over: twelve men from Benjamin, from the side of Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, and twelve of David’s servants.

(2 Samuel 2:16) 
Each man grabbed his opponent by the head, and they thrust their swords into each other's sides, so they all fell down together and died. And the name of that place was called 'Field of Swords' or 'Field of Sharp Edges' in Gibeon, commemorating this bloody duel.

(2 Samuel 2:17) 
And a very fierce battle ensued on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated and fled from David’s servants.

(2 Samuel 2:18) 
Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was as swift of foot as a gazelle in the open fields.

(2 Samuel 2:19) 
Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn to the right or to the left from chasing after Abner.

(2 Samuel 2:20) 
So Abner looked back over his shoulder and said, 'Are you Asahel?' And he answered, 'I am.'

(2 Samuel 2:21) 
And Abner said to him, 'Turn aside to the right or to the left, and seize one of the younger men and take his armor and plunder for yourself.' But Asahel was unwilling to turn back from him, and Abner continued to insist that he stop chasing him.

(2 Samuel 2:22) 
Abner spoke again to Asahel, saying, 'Stop pursuing me! I do not want to be forced to strike you down to the ground. If I do, how could I ever face your brother Joab again, knowing I killed his brother?'

(2 Samuel 2:23) 
But Asahel disdained to listen and would not turn aside. So Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt-end of his spear, and Asahel was pierced through and died in that very spot. And all who passed by the place where Asahel’s body lay, stopped and gathered there.

(2 Samuel 2:24) 
However, Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And the sun had set when they reached the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah, on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 2:25) 
And so the sons of Benjamin gathered together with Abner; they formed one compact fighting unit and took a stand on the top of a small hill.

(2 Samuel 2:26) 
And Abner called out to Joab, saying, 'Will your sword rage on to utter destruction forever? Do you not know that desperation is dangerous? How long will it be until you tell the people to stop pursuing their own brothers, the people of Israel?'

(2 Samuel 2:27) 
And Joab said, 'As the Lord lives, if you had not spoken up, then by morning all the people would have seen that each man would have abandoned his pursuit of his brother.'

(2 Samuel 2:28) 
Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still. They no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight any longer.

(2 Samuel 2:29) 
But Abner and his men marched through the valley all that night, and they crossed the Jordan River. They journeyed through all of Beth-Horon, and then they came to Mahanaim.

(2 Samuel 2:30) 
Joab also returned from pursuing Abner and gathered all the army. And nineteen men were missing from David’s servants, besides Asahel, who was already accounted for.

(2 Samuel 2:31) 
But David’s servants had struck down three hundred and sixty men from Benjamin and from Abner’s men, and all of those men were dead.

(2 Samuel 2:32) 
Then they took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. And Joab and the men who were with him marched all night, and the sun rose upon them as they arrived in Hebron.

(2 Samuel 3:1) 
There was a long war between Saul's royal house and David's royal house. David was making progress and becoming stronger, but Saul's royal house was losing power every day.

(2 Samuel 3:2) 
Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born of Ahinoam from Jezreel.

(2 Samuel 3:3) 
His second son was Chileab, born of Abigail, who had been Nabal the Carmelite's wife. And his third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.

(2 Samuel 3:4) 
His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. And his fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.

(2 Samuel 3:5) 
His sixth son was Ithream, born of Eglah, another of David's wives. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.

(2 Samuel 3:6) 
During the war between Saul's royal house and David's royal house, Abner, son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, grew very powerful in support of Saul's house.

(2 Samuel 3:7) 
Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth, Saul's son and successor, asked Abner, "Why did you have relations with my father's concubine?"

(2 Samuel 3:8) 
Abner became very angry over Ish-bosheth's words and responded, "Am I a dog's head from Judah? I am the one showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul today, and to his brothers and his friends, and I have not handed you over to David's power. Yet today you accuse me of a sin concerning a woman?"

(2 Samuel 3:9) 
Then Abner swore an oath, saying, "May God do so to Abner, and even more, if I do not act according to what the Lord swore to David and make it happen for him.

(2 Samuel 3:10) 
My goal is to transfer the kingdom from Saul's royal house and establish David's throne over both Israel and Judah, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south."

(2 Samuel 3:11) 
Ish-bosheth could not say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.

(2 Samuel 3:12) 
So Abner sent messengers to David, on his own behalf, saying, "To whom does the land truly belong?" He also said, "Make a covenant with me, and my hand will be with you, and I will bring all of Israel to you."

(2 Samuel 3:13) 
David replied, "Good. I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."

(2 Samuel 3:14) 
David then sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Return my wife Michal to me, whom I acquired as my betrothed by providing one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."

(2 Samuel 3:15) 
So Ish-bosheth sent men and took her away from her husband, Paltiel, the son of Laish.

(2 Samuel 3:16) 
Her husband followed her, weeping, all the way to Bahurim. But Abner said to him, "Go back now; turn around." And so he went back.

(2 Samuel 3:17) 
Abner had also spoken to the elders of Israel, saying, "For a long time now, you have desired David to reign over you.

(2 Samuel 3:18) 
Now therefore, act upon it. For the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from all their enemies.'"

(2 Samuel 3:19) 
Abner also spoke directly to the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to David in Hebron to report everything that pleased Israel and the entire house of Benjamin.

(2 Samuel 3:20) 
So Abner came to David in Hebron with twenty men. And David prepared a feast for Abner and the men who had come with him.

(2 Samuel 3:21) 
Abner said to David, "I will rise and gather all Israel to you, my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you may rule over all of them, just as your heart desires." Then David sent Abner away, and he departed in peace.

(2 Samuel 3:22) 
Just as David's servants and Joab returned from a successful raid, bringing much plunder, they found that Abner was no longer in Hebron. Indeed, David had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.

(2 Samuel 3:23) 
Joab went in to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why did you let him leave and depart?

(2 Samuel 3:24) 
You don't know Abner, son of Ner, that he came to you only to deceive you, to find out your movements, your comings and goings, and everything you are doing?"

(2 Samuel 3:25) 
And Joab, having left David's presence, sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah, without David knowing it.

(2 Samuel 3:26) 
When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab led him aside to the gate, as if to speak to him privately, and there he struck him in the side, and he died. This was for the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother, whom Abner had killed in battle.

(2 Samuel 3:27) 
After this, David heard the news and declared, "I am innocent, and my kingdom is innocent before the Lord forever, of the blood of Abner, son of Ner.

(2 Samuel 3:28) 
May his blood come upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house. May there never cease from Joab's house someone with a discharge, or a leper, or one who holds a spindle (a woman's work, implying weakness), or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks bread."

(2 Samuel 3:29) 
So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, in the battle at Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 3:30) 
Then David commanded Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David himself followed the bier.

(2 Samuel 3:31) 
They buried Abner in Hebron. The king raised his voice and wept at Abner's tomb. And all the people also wept.

(2 Samuel 3:32) 
And all the people tried to persuade David to eat some food. But David swore an oath, saying, "May God do so to me, and even more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets."

(2 Samuel 3:33) 
All the people took notice of this, and they were pleased. For everything the king did was pleasing in the sight of all the people.

(2 Samuel 3:34) 
And all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had not been responsible for the killing of Abner, son of Ner.

(2 Samuel 3:35) 
The king said to his servants, weeping, "Do you not know that a prince, a very great man, has fallen this day in Israel?"

(2 Samuel 3:36) 
David continued, "Even though I am anointed by God, I feel weak and vulnerable today, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too severe for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness."

(2 Samuel 3:37) 
And all the people and all Israel knew that day that it was not by the king's doing that Abner, son of Ner, was killed.

(2 Samuel 3:38) 
The king had also said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?"

(2 Samuel 3:39) 
Furthermore, I am delicate (vulnerable) today, though I am an anointed king. And these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. May the Lord repay the one who does evil according to his wickedness.

(2 Samuel 3:1) 
So there was a long war between the royal house of Saul and the royal house of David. David grew in strength and became ever more powerful, while the house of Saul weakened daily.

(2 Samuel 3:2) 
Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born from Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess.

(2 Samuel 3:3) 
His second son was Chileab, born from Abigail, Nabal the Carmelite's widow. His third son was Absalom, born from Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.

(2 Samuel 3:4) 
His fourth son was Adonijah, born from Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, born from Abital.

(2 Samuel 3:5) 
And his sixth son was Ithream, born from Eglah, another one of David's wives. These sons were all born to David in Hebron, while he reigned there.

(2 Samuel 3:6) 
While the war was ongoing between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner, son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, acted with increasing defiance on behalf of Saul's house.

(2 Samuel 3:7) 
Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth accused Abner, saying, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine? That makes you a claimant to his throne."

(2 Samuel 3:8) 
Abner became extremely angry because of Ish-bosheth's words and responded, "Am I a dog's head, deserving of such an insult? This very day I am loyal to Judah! I have shown mercy to the house of your father Saul, and to his brothers and kinsmen, and I haven't handed you over to David's control! Yet you accuse me today of a sin with a woman?"

(2 Samuel 3:9) 
Abner swore an oath, saying, "May God do this to Abner, and more also, if I do not act exactly as the Lord swore to David."

(2 Samuel 3:10) 
"That is, I will transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over all of Israel and Judah, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south."

(2 Samuel 3:11) 
Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner a single word because he was afraid of him.

(2 Samuel 3:12) 
So Abner immediately sent messengers to David, saying on his own behalf, "To whom does the land truly belong? Make a covenant with me, and behold, I am ready to help you turn all of Israel over to your rule."

(2 Samuel 3:13) 
David replied, "Good, I will make a covenant with you. But I demand one thing from you: you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."

(2 Samuel 3:14) 
David also sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me back my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of one hundred Philistine foreskins."

(2 Samuel 3:15) 
So Ish-bosheth sent for her and took her away from her husband, Paltiel, son of Laish.

(2 Samuel 3:16) 
Her husband followed her, weeping as he went, all the way to Bahurim. Abner said to him, "Go back!" So he returned.

(2 Samuel 3:17) 
Abner also spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, "Both yesterday and the day before, you were seeking to have David reign over you."

(2 Samuel 3:18) 
"Now therefore, act upon it, for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, 'By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"

(2 Samuel 3:19) 
Abner also spoke to the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to speak to David in Hebron, conveying all that had pleased Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin.

(2 Samuel 3:20) 
So Abner came to David in Hebron, with twenty men accompanying him. David held a feast for Abner and the men who had come with him.

(2 Samuel 3:21) 
Abner said to David, "I will go now and gather all Israel to you, my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you may rule over all of them, just as your heart desires." David then sent Abner away, and he departed in peace.

(2 Samuel 3:22) 
Just then, David's servants and Joab returned from a raid, bringing many spoils with them. Abner, however, was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.

(2 Samuel 3:23) 
When Joab arrived, he was told, "Abner, son of Ner, came to the king, and the king sent him away, and he departed in peace."

(2 Samuel 3:24) 
Joab went in to the king and asked, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you! Why did you send him away so that he just left?"

(2 Samuel 3:25) 
"Don't you know Abner, son of Ner? He came to you only to deceive you, to learn your coming and going, and to discover all your plans."

(2 Samuel 3:26) 
After Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David did not know about it.

(2 Samuel 3:27) 
When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside inside the gate, as if to speak to him privately. There, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died, in revenge for the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother.

(2 Samuel 3:28) 
When David heard of it afterward, he declared, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord forever concerning the blood of Abner, son of Ner."

(2 Samuel 3:29) 
"May the guilt for Abner's death fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house. May the house of Joab never lack someone afflicted with a discharge, or a leper, or one who holds a distaff, or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks bread."

(2 Samuel 3:30) 
So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel in battle at Gibeon.

(2 Samuel 3:31) 
Then David commanded Joab and all the people who were with him, saying, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David himself followed the bier.

(2 Samuel 3:32) 
When they had buried Abner in Hebron, the king lifted his voice and wept at Abner's tomb. All the people also wept.

(2 Samuel 3:33) 
And the king lamented and said, "Should Abner have died like a fool?"

(2 Samuel 3:34) 
"Your hands were not bound, nor your feet shackled. You fell as a wicked man falls, before treacherous men." And all the people wept over him again.

(2 Samuel 3:35) 
All the people came to offer David food while it was still daylight, but David swore an oath, saying, "May God do this to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets."

(2 Samuel 3:36) 
All the people understood this, and it pleased them; indeed, everything the king did was pleasing in the sight of all the people.

(2 Samuel 3:37) 
So all the people and all of Israel understood that day that the killing of Abner, son of Ner, had not been the king's doing.

(2 Samuel 3:38) 
The king also said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"

(2 Samuel 3:39) 
"And though I am still weak and newly anointed as king, these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me to control. May the Lord repay the evil-doer according to his wickedness."

(2 Samuel 4:1) 
When Saul's son, Ishbaal, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost all courage, and all of Israel was troubled by this news.

(2 Samuel 4:2) 
Now, Saul's son had two captains of his raiding bands: one was named Baanah, and the other was Rechab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; Beeroth itself was also considered part of Benjamin.

(2 Samuel 4:3) 
The Beerothites had fled to Gittaim and lived there as foreign residents up until that time.

(2 Samuel 4:4) 
Now, Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came from Jezreel about Saul and Jonathan. His nurse picked him up and carried him, but as she hurried to flee, she fell, and he became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.

(2 Samuel 4:5) 
So Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went and came to Ishbaal's house during the heat of the day. Ishbaal was sleeping on his bed at noon.

(2 Samuel 4:6) 
And behold, the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleaning wheat, had fallen asleep. So these men, secretly bringing in their hands through the doorway, struck him in the stomach and fled.

(2 Samuel 4:7) 
For when they had entered the house, he was sleeping on his bed in the inner chamber. They struck him and killed him. Then they took his head and went away by the desert road all night long.

(2 Samuel 4:8) 
They brought the head of Ishbaal to David in Hebron and said to the king: 'Behold, here is the head of Ishbaal, son of Saul, your enemy, who sought to kill you. The Lord has today given our lord the king vengeance on Saul and his descendants.'

(2 Samuel 4:9) 
But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them: 'As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from all distress—'

(2 Samuel 4:10) 
'—when someone told me that Saul was dead, thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That man thought he deserved a reward for his message!'

(2 Samuel 4:11) 
'How much more then should I punish you, wicked men, who have killed a righteous man in his own house, on his own bed? Therefore, I will now demand his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth.'

(2 Samuel 4:12) 
Then David commanded his young men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies over the pool in Hebron. But they took Ishbaal's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron.

(2 Samuel 4:1) 
But Ishbosheth, who was Saul’s son, heard the news that Abner had been killed in Hebron. Ishbosheth then became utterly powerless to act, and all of Israel became fearful and in turmoil.

(2 Samuel 4:2) 
Now, two men who were commanders of raiding parties were serving Saul’s son. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin—for Beeroth was also accounted as part of Benjamin.

(2 Samuel 4:3) 
The Beerothites had fled to Gittaim and had lived there as foreigners up until that very day.

(2 Samuel 4:4) 
Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was disabled in his feet. He was five years old when the news came from Jezreel about Saul and Jonathan’s deaths. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was Meribbaal.

(2 Samuel 4:5) 
So, Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and went into Ishbosheth’s house during the heat of the day, while he was taking his noonday nap.

(2 Samuel 4:6) 
And behold, the woman who guarded the entrance to the house was sifting wheat and had fallen asleep. So, Rechab and his brother Baanah secretly entered, struck Ishbosheth in the stomach, and then fled.

(2 Samuel 4:7) 
Indeed, when they had entered the house, Ishbosheth was sleeping on his bed in his inner chamber. They struck him and killed him. Then, taking his head, they departed by way of the desert road throughout the entire night.

(2 Samuel 4:8) 
They brought Ishbosheth’s head to David in Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Today, the Lord has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his descendants.”

(2 Samuel 4:9) 
David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has delivered my soul from all distress and trouble—”

(2 Samuel 4:10) 
“—for the man who announced to me that Saul was dead, thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. I should have given him a reward for his message, but instead, he died for it.”

(2 Samuel 4:11) 
“How much more, then, when wicked men have murdered an innocent man in his own home, on his own bed, shall I not demand his blood from your hands and utterly remove you from the face of the earth?”

(2 Samuel 4:12) 
So David commanded his young men, and they executed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But Ishbosheth’s head they took and buried in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.

(2 Samuel 5:1) 
All the tribes of Israel gathered with David in Hebron, and they said: "Look, we are your own kin—your bone and your flesh."

(2 Samuel 5:2) 
Even before now, and for some time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel into battle and brought them back safely. And the Lord Himself spoke to you, saying: "You will shepherd My people, Israel, and you will be a leader over Israel."

(2 Samuel 5:3) 
Then all the elders of Israel also came to King David in Hebron. And King David made a covenant with them in Hebron, in the presence of the Lord. And they anointed David as king over all Israel.

(2 Samuel 5:4) 
David was forty years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for forty years in total.

(2 Samuel 5:5) 
In Hebron, David reigned over Judah alone for seven years and six months. Then in Jerusalem, he reigned for thirty-three years over both all of Israel and Judah.

(2 Samuel 5:6) 
Then the king and all the men who were with him went to Jerusalem, where the Jebusites lived. And the Jebusites said to David: "You will not enter here unless you defeat even the blind and the lame." They were taunting David by saying: "David will not be able to enter here!"

(2 Samuel 5:7) 
But David captured the stronghold of Zion. This stronghold later became known as the City of David.

(2 Samuel 5:8) 
For David had said on that day: "Whoever is able to strike down the Jebusites, let him go up through the water shaft to reach these lame and blind ones who so hate David's soul." Because of this, it is said in a proverb: "The blind and the lame will not enter the house of the Lord." The Jebusites' taunt came back to bite them.

(2 Samuel 5:9) 
So David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David. And David built up the city around it, from the Millo—a defensive structure—inward.

(2 Samuel 5:10) 
And David continued to prosper and grew ever more powerful, because the Lord, the God of all creation and armies, was with him.

(2 Samuel 5:11) 
Hiram, the king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, and carpenters and stonemasons. And they built a royal palace for David.

(2 Samuel 5:12) 
And David knew with certainty that the Lord had firmly established him as king over all Israel, and that He had greatly exalted David's kingdom over His own people, Israel.

(2 Samuel 5:13) 
After David had come from Hebron to Jerusalem, he also took more wives and concubines from Jerusalem, and sons and daughters were born to him there.

(2 Samuel 5:14) 
And these are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

(2 Samuel 5:15) 
Also Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia,

(2 Samuel 5:16) 
And Elishama, Elioda, and Eliphalet.

(2 Samuel 5:17) 
Now the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek out David for battle. When David heard this, he went down to a secure defensive position.

(2 Samuel 5:18) 
But the Philistines came and spread out through the Valley of Rephaim.

(2 Samuel 5:19) 
And David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?" And the Lord answered David: "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."

(2 Samuel 5:20) 
So David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck down the Philistines there. Then David said: "The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, just as a powerful flood breaks through a barrier." Therefore, the name of that place was called Baal Perazim, meaning "Lord of Breakings Through."

(2 Samuel 5:21) 
And the Philistines abandoned their idols there, which David and his men then carried away.

(2 Samuel 5:22) 
But the Philistines came up again, and once more they spread out through the Valley of Rephaim.

(2 Samuel 5:23) 
And David consulted the Lord again, who answered: "You shall not attack them directly. Instead, circle around behind them, and come at them from the direction of the mulberry trees."

(2 Samuel 5:24) 
And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that will be your signal to launch the attack. For then the Lord Himself will go out before you to strike down the camp of the Philistines.

(2 Samuel 5:25) 
So David did exactly as the Lord had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines, driving them from Geba all the way to Gezer.

(2 Samuel 5:1) 
So all the leaders and representatives from the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying to him, 'Look, we are your own flesh and blood, your very kin.'

(2 Samuel 5:2) 
Even before this, when Saul was still king over us, you were the one who led the people of Israel in and out of battle. And the Lord God himself said to you: 'You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be their true leader.'

(2 Samuel 5:3) 
Therefore, all the elders of Israel also came to King David in Hebron. And David made a solemn covenant with them there in Hebron, in the very presence of the Lord God. Then they publicly anointed David as king over all Israel.

(2 Samuel 5:4) 
David was thirty years old when he began his reign as king, and he reigned for a total of forty years.

(2 Samuel 5:5) 
In Hebron, he reigned over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months. Afterwards, in Jerusalem, he reigned over all of both Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.

(2 Samuel 5:6) 
Then the king and all the men who were with him went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites who inhabited that land. The Jebusites defiantly said to David, 'You will not enter this place! Even the blind and the lame can drive you out,' mockingly asserting, 'David will never enter here!'

(2 Samuel 5:7) 
Nevertheless, David successfully captured the stronghold of Zion. This place became known as the City of David.

(2 Samuel 5:8) 
For David had declared on that day: 'Whoever strikes down a Jebusite must ascend through the water shaft and attack these blind and lame ones who are so hated by David's soul.' This is why it is said in a proverb: 'The blind and the lame will not enter the holy place.'

(2 Samuel 5:9) 
So David took up residence in the stronghold, and he named it the City of David. Then David built walls and fortifications all around the city, from the Millo inward.

(2 Samuel 5:10) 
And David continued to prosper, growing in power and becoming highly esteemed, because the Lord God of hosts—the God of armies—was with him.

(2 Samuel 5:11) 
Hiram, the king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons. And these skilled craftsmen built a royal palace for David.

(2 Samuel 5:12) 
And David understood that the Lord God had firmly established him as king over all Israel, and that He had greatly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.

(2 Samuel 5:13) 
After he came from Hebron, David also took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem. And more sons and daughters were born to him there.

(2 Samuel 5:14) 
These are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon.

(2 Samuel 5:15) 
Ibhar, Elishua, and Nepheg.

(2 Samuel 5:16) 
Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.

(2 Samuel 5:17) 
Now the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, and all the Philistines came up to seek him out and fight. When David heard this, he went down to his stronghold—a secure place.

(2 Samuel 5:18) 
Meanwhile, the Philistines had come and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.

(2 Samuel 5:19) 
And David consulted the Lord God, saying, 'Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over into my power?' The Lord God said to David, 'Go up, for I will surely hand the Philistines over into your power.'

(2 Samuel 5:20) 
So David came to Baal Perazim. There David struck them down and said, 'The Lord God has broken through my enemies before me, just as waters burst forth and divide!' Therefore, the name of that place was called Baal Perazim, meaning 'Lord of Breakthroughs'.

(2 Samuel 5:21) 
And there the Philistines abandoned their idols. David and his men then carried these idols away.

(2 Samuel 5:22) 
But the Philistines came up again and spread themselves out once more in the Valley of Rephaim.

(2 Samuel 5:23) 
And David again consulted the Lord God. He responded, 'Do not go up directly against them. Instead, circle around behind them, and attack them from the front of the balsam trees.'

(2 Samuel 5:24) 
And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you must rush forward, for at that very moment, the Lord God will go out before you to strike down the Philistine army.

(2 Samuel 5:25) 
So David did just as the Lord God had commanded him. He struck down the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer.

(2 Samuel 6:1) 
So King David gathered together again all the chosen warriors of Israel, thirty thousand of them.

(2 Samuel 6:2) 
David himself went up, and all the people with him, from among the men of Judah, to bring the Ark of God back. This Ark is where the very Name of the Lord of all Creation is called upon, the Lord who is enthroned above the Cherubim.

(2 Samuel 6:3) 
They placed the Ark of God upon a new wagon, and they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which was located on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, were driving this new wagon.

(2 Samuel 6:4) 
As they carried it from Abinadab's house—Abinadab being the man who lived on the hill—Ahio walked ahead of the Ark.

(2 Samuel 6:5) 
Meanwhile, King David and all Israel were joyfully celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of musical instruments made of fir wood: with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.

(2 Samuel 6:6) 
But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nachon, Uzzah reached out his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen stumbled and had nearly overturned it.

(2 Samuel 6:7) 
And the Lord became angry with Uzzah, and He struck him down there for his rash irreverence. So Uzzah died there beside the Ark of God.

(2 Samuel 6:8) 
David was saddened because the Lord had struck Uzzah in this way. And he named that place 'The Striking of Uzzah,' a name it holds even to this present day.

(2 Samuel 6:9) 
David then greatly feared the Lord on that day, saying: "How can the Ark of the Lord possibly come to me now?"

(2 Samuel 6:10) 
And David decided not to bring the Ark of the Lord into the City of David for himself. Instead, he diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom, the Gittite.

(2 Samuel 6:11) 
So the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom, the Gittite, for three months. And the Lord blessed Obed-Edom and his entire household.

(2 Samuel 6:12) 
It was reported to King David, with people saying: "The Lord has blessed Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him because of the Ark of God." So David went, and he brought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the City of David with great joy.

(2 Samuel 6:13) 
And when those who were carrying the Ark of the Lord had taken six steps, they sacrificed an ox and a ram as offerings to God.

(2 Samuel 6:14) 
And David was dancing with all his might before the Lord. King David was dressed only in a linen ephod, a priestly garment.

(2 Samuel 6:15) 
So David and all the house of Israel brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into Jerusalem with joyful shouting and the blast of the trumpet.

(2 Samuel 6:16) 
And when the Ark of the Lord entered the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out through a window. She saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart for his undignified behavior.

(2 Samuel 6:17) 
They brought the Ark of the Lord inside and placed it in its designated spot, in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.

(2 Samuel 6:18) 
When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of the Lord of all Creation.

(2 Samuel 6:19) 
Then he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, to both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted meat, and a cake fried in oil to each person. And all the people departed, each to their own home.

(2 Samuel 6:20) 
Then David returned to bless his own household. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to meet David and said: "How glorious the King of Israel made himself today! He exposed himself before the servant girls of his own servants, uncovering himself just as a vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!"

(2 Samuel 6:21) 
And David said to Michal: "I was dancing before the Lord—the One who chose me rather than your father and rather than his entire house, and who commanded me to be a leader over the Lord's people in Israel. I will continue to celebrate and humble myself before the Lord!"

(2 Samuel 6:22) 
I will even humble myself more than I did today, and I will be lowly in my own estimation. Yet, I will be held in honor by these very servant girls about whom you have spoken so scornfully.

(2 Samuel 6:23) 
Therefore, Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child until the day of her death.

(2 Samuel 6:1) 
David gathered again all the chosen men from Israel—30,000 men in total.

(2 Samuel 6:2) 
And David arose and went with all the people who were with him, from the men of Judah, to bring up the Ark of God from that place. The Ark of God is the sacred object upon which the Most Holy Name of the Lord of armies is invoked, who is enthroned above the Cherubim on it.

(2 Samuel 6:3) 
And they placed the Ark of God upon a new cart. Then they took it from the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.

(2 Samuel 6:4) 
And when they had taken it from the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah, Ahio walked in front of the Ark.

(2 Samuel 6:5) 
But David and all of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all sorts of instruments made of wood: harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.

(2 Samuel 6:6) 
After they reached Nachon's threshing floor, the oxen stumbled and turned aside. So Uzzah stretched out his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it to steady it.

(2 Samuel 6:7) 
And the Lord was angry against Uzzah, and struck him for his rashness—touching the sacred Ark was forbidden—and he died there beside the Ark of God.

(2 Samuel 6:8) 
And David was saddened because the Lord had struck Uzzah, and the name of that place has been called The Striking of Uzzah until the present day.

(2 Samuel 6:9) 
And David was filled with reverential fear for the Lord that day, saying, 'How shall the Ark of the Lord come to me?'

(2 Samuel 6:10) 
And he did not want to bring the Ark of the Lord to himself into the City of David, but diverted it to the house of Obededom the Gittite.

(2 Samuel 6:11) 
Therefore, the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obededom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord bestowed blessings upon Obededom and all his household.

(2 Samuel 6:12) 
And it was reported to King David, saying to him, 'The Lord has bestowed blessings upon Obededom and all his possessions because of the Ark of God.' So David went up and brought the Ark of the Lord from the house of Obededom into the City of David with joy.

(2 Samuel 6:13) 
And when those who carried the Ark of the Lord had completed a space of six steps, they offered a bull and a ram as sacrifices—a ritual of purification and dedication.

(2 Samuel 6:14) 
And David was dancing with great fervor before the Lord in worship. David was wearing a linen ephod, a priestly garment.

(2 Samuel 6:15) 
And all of Israel was bringing up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with joyful shouts and with the sound of the trumpet.

(2 Samuel 6:16) 
And when the Ark of the Lord came into the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out through a window. She saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she scorned him in her heart.

(2 Samuel 6:17) 
And they brought in the Ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.

(2 Samuel 6:18) 
And when he had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he invoked blessings upon the people in the name of the Lord of armies.

(2 Samuel 6:19) 
And he distributed to the entire multitude of Israel, to both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted beef, and a fried cake made with oil. Then all the people went, each to his own house.

(2 Samuel 6:20) 
And David returned to bless his household. Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to meet David and said sarcastically, 'How splendid the king of Israel was today! He uncovered himself before the servant girls of his servants, as a common jester might uncover himself!'

(2 Samuel 6:21) 
And David said to Michal, 'I was celebrating before the Lord! It was the Lord who chose me instead of your father and all his house. He commanded me to be a leader over the people of the Lord in Israel. Therefore, I will celebrate and rejoice and humble myself before the Lord.'

(2 Samuel 6:22) 
'And I will humble myself even more than before, and I will be humble in my own eyes. And as for the servant girls about whom you spoke, I will be held in honor by them.'

(2 Samuel 6:23) 
Therefore, Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child until the day of her death.

(2 Samuel 7:1) 
It happened that the king was finally settled in his own home, and the Lord had given him peace and rest from all the enemies surrounding him from every side.

(2 Samuel 7:2) 
He said to Nathan the prophet: 'Do you not see that I, David, live in a magnificent palace built with cedar wood, while the Ark of God still resides within mere tent fabrics?'

(2 Samuel 7:3) 
Nathan replied to the king, 'Go ahead and do whatever is in your heart, for the Lord God is truly with you.'

(2 Samuel 7:4) 
However, that very night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:

(2 Samuel 7:5) 
'Go and say to My servant David: “Thus says the Lord God: Is it truly you who will build a house for Me to dwell in?

(2 Samuel 7:6) 
For I have not lived in a permanent house since the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day. Instead, I have moved around with them, dwelling in a tabernacle and a tent.

(2 Samuel 7:7) 
Throughout all the places where I have traveled with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a single word to any of the tribal leaders of Israel—whom I appointed to shepherd My people, Israel—saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'

(2 Samuel 7:8) 
Therefore, now, you shall say this to My servant David: 'Thus says the Lord, God of all heavenly powers: I Myself took you from the pastures, where you were following the sheep, to be a prince and leader over My people Israel.

(2 Samuel 7:9) 
And I have been with you in every place you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. I have made your name great, like the names of the most powerful and famous rulers on the earth.

(2 Samuel 7:10) 
I will also provide a secure place for My people Israel and establish them there, so that they will live in their own land and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them again, as they did from the beginning,

(2 Samuel 7:11) 
this will be from the time I appointed judges over My people Israel. Furthermore, I will give you rest from all your enemies. And the Lord reveals to you that He Himself will build you a house — a dynasty, a lasting lineage.

(2 Samuel 7:12) 
When your life's days are complete, and you go to rest with your ancestors in death, I will raise up your offspring after you—one who will come from your own body—and I will firmly establish his kingdom.

(2 Samuel 7:13) 
He, your son, is the one who will build a physical house — a Temple — for My name, a place where My presence and glory will be honored. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom, confirming it forever.

(2 Samuel 7:14) 
I will be a Father to him, and he will be My son. If he commits any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod and punishment fitting for human beings, to bring him back to righteousness.

(2 Samuel 7:15) 
But My mercy and steadfast love will not be taken away from him, unlike what happened with Saul, whom I removed from My presence as king.

(2 Samuel 7:16) 
Your dynastic house and your kingdom will endure before Me eternally, and your royal throne will be firmly established forever and ever.

(2 Samuel 7:17) 
According to all these words and this entire vision, Nathan then spoke to David.

(2 Samuel 7:18) 
Then King David went into the Lord’s presence, sat down before Him, and said, 'Who am I, Lord God, and what is my household, that You have brought me to such a high and honorable position?'

(2 Samuel 7:19) 
Yet even this, Lord God, seemed too little in Your sight, for You have also spoken about the future of Your servant’s house for generations to come. This is indeed the profound and lasting destiny You have decreed for mankind, O Lord God.

(2 Samuel 7:20) 
What more can David say to You, Lord God, in addition to this? For You, Lord God, know Your servant intimately.

(2 Samuel 7:21) 
It is because of Your word and according to Your own heart’s desire that You have done all these magnificent things, and have made them known to Your servant.

(2 Samuel 7:22) 
For this reason, You are truly great, O Lord God! There is no one like You, and there is no God apart from You, according to all that we have heard with our own ears throughout history.

(2 Samuel 7:23) 
And what other nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom You went out to redeem for Yourself as Your own special people, to make a glorious name for Yourself? You performed magnificent and awe-inspiring deeds for them on the earth, by redeeming Your own people out of Egypt, demonstrating Your power before other nations who witnessed it.

(2 Samuel 7:24) 
For You have established Your people Israel for Yourself as a people to endure eternally, and You, Lord God, have truly become their God.

(2 Samuel 7:25) 
Now, therefore, Lord God, confirm the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his dynastic house, and make it stand firm eternally; indeed, do as You have spoken.

(2 Samuel 7:26) 
So that Your name may be magnified eternally, and people will say, 'The Lord, God of all heavenly powers, is truly God over Israel!' And may the dynastic house of Your servant David remain stable and enduring before You.

(2 Samuel 7:27) 
For You, Lord God of all heavenly powers, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant’s hearing, saying, 'I Myself will build you a dynastic house.' Because of this assurance, Your servant has found the confidence in his heart to pray this prayer to You.

(2 Samuel 7:28) 
And now, Lord God, You are God indeed, and Your words are true and faithful. You Yourself have spoken these good promises to Your servant.

(2 Samuel 7:29) 
Therefore, now begin and bless the dynastic house of Your servant, so that it may continue eternally before You. For You, Lord God, have spoken it, and with Your blessing, the dynastic house of Your servant will indeed be blessed forever and ever.

(2 Samuel 7:1) 
It happened when King David had settled in his own house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, those who were his adversaries—

(2 Samuel 7:2) 
he said to Nathan the prophet: “You see that I live in a house built of cedar wood, but the Ark of God is placed only in the midst of curtains—meaning, a tent.”

(2 Samuel 7:3) 
And Nathan said to the king: “Everything that is in your heart to do, go and do it, because the Lord is with you.”

(2 Samuel 7:4) 
However, on that very night, behold, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:

(2 Samuel 7:5) 
“Go, and speak to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord: Is it you who will build me a house to dwell in?’

(2 Samuel 7:6) 
For I have not dwelt in a fixed house from the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day: instead, I have walked about in a tabernacle, and in a tent.

(2 Samuel 7:7) 
Through all the places I have passed with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying: ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’

(2 Samuel 7:8) 
And now, you shall say these things to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord of armies: I took you from the pastures, following the flocks, so that you would be a leader over my people Israel:

(2 Samuel 7:9) 
and I have been with you in everything, wherever you have walked, and I have cut off all your enemies from before your face. And I have made for you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.

(2 Samuel 7:10) 
And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them there, and they will dwell under it, and they will no longer be disturbed. Nor will the children of iniquity continue to afflict them, as from the beginning—

(2 Samuel 7:11) 
from the day I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Furthermore, the Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will make a house—a dynasty—for you.

(2 Samuel 7:12) 
And when your days are completed, and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.

(2 Samuel 7:13) 
He himself will build a house—the Temple—for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

(2 Samuel 7:14) 
I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to me. If he does anything wickedly, I will correct him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.

(2 Samuel 7:15) 
But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I took away from before my face.

(2 Samuel 7:16) 
And your house will be faithful, and your kingdom will endure forever before you, and your throne will be firm perpetually—this promise is fulfilled in your descendant, Christ the Lord.

(2 Samuel 7:17) 
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.

(2 Samuel 7:18) 
Then King David entered and sat before the Lord, and said: “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me to such a greatness?

(2 Samuel 7:19) 
But even this is small in your sight, O Lord God, unless you have also spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time to come—into eternity. For this is the law of Adam, O Lord God—a universal and enduring decree for humanity.

(2 Samuel 7:20) 
What more then can David add, that he should speak to you? For you know your servant, O Lord God.

(2 Samuel 7:21) 
Because of your word, and according to your own heart, you have done all these great things, so that you might make them known to your servant.

(2 Samuel 7:22) 
Therefore you are magnified, O Lord God, because there is no one like you, nor is there any God besides you, in all that we have heard with our own ears.

(2 Samuel 7:23) 
And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom you went to redeem for yourself as a people, and to establish for yourself a name, and to do for them great and terrible things on the earth, from before the nations you redeemed for yourself out of Egypt?

(2 Samuel 7:24) 
And you have established for yourself your people Israel as an eternal people, and you, O Lord God, have become their God.

(2 Samuel 7:25) 
Now therefore, O Lord God, the word which you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, raise it up forever, and do as you have spoken.

(2 Samuel 7:26) 
So that your name may be magnified forever, with people saying: 'The Lord of armies is God over Israel.' And the house of your servant David will be stable before you.

(2 Samuel 7:27) 
Because you, O Lord of armies, God of Israel, have revealed in the ear of your servant, saying: ‘I will build a house—a dynasty—for you,’ therefore your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to you.

(2 Samuel 7:28) 
Now therefore, O Lord God, you are God, and your words will be true. You have spoken these good things to your servant.

(2 Samuel 7:29) 
Begin therefore, and bless the house of your servant, that it may be forever before you. Because you, O Lord God, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.

(2 Samuel 8:1) 
After these events, David waged war against the Philistines, defeating them and humbling their power. David seized control over their chief city, making them subject to his rule and compelling them to pay tribute.

(2 Samuel 8:1) 
After these events, David attacked the Philistines and utterly subdued them. David then took what the Latin calls 'the bridle of tribute' from Gath, meaning he seized control of this principal Philistine city and its surrounding territories, forcing them into submission and tribute.

(2 Samuel 8:2) 
David also attacked the Moabites, subjecting them to a severe judgment. He measured them out with a rope, as if laying them flat on the ground for execution. He put two-thirds of them to death, sparing only one-third. Thus, Moab became servants of David, compelled to pay him tribute.

(2 Samuel 8:3) 
David also struck Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, who was the king of Zobah. This happened when Hadadezer was on an expedition to extend his dominion all the way to the Euphrates River.

(2 Samuel 8:4) 
David captured a vast military force from Hadadezer: seventeen hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. As a tactical move to prevent their future use in warfare against him, David then crippled all the horses intended for chariots by cutting their leg tendons, except for those needed for one hundred chariots, which he kept.

(2 Samuel 8:5) 
The Syrians from Damascus also came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. But David defeated them too, striking down twenty-two thousand Syrian soldiers.

(2 Samuel 8:6) 
David then established garrisons throughout the region of Damascus in Syria. As a result, Syria became subject to David, obligated to pay him tribute. The Lord God assisted David in every endeavor he undertook.

(2 Samuel 8:7) 
David also took the golden shields that belonged to Hadadezer’s royal officers, and he brought these valuable spoils of war back to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 8:8) 
From Betah and Beroth, which were cities belonging to Hadadezer, King David seized a vast quantity of bronze.

(2 Samuel 8:9) 
Then Tou, the king of Hamath, heard the news that David had defeated Hadadezer’s entire army.

(2 Samuel 8:10) 
King Tou then sent his son, Joram, to King David. Joram’s mission was to offer a formal greeting, to congratulate David on his victory, and to express gratitude because David had fought against and defeated Hadadezer. This was a significant act, as King Tou was an enemy of Hadadezer. Joram also brought gifts of silver, gold, and bronze vessels for David.

(2 Samuel 8:11) 
King David consecrated these gifts, along with all the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued, to the Lord. This act of sanctification meant they were set aside for sacred use in the service of God.

(2 Samuel 8:12) 
These consecrated offerings came from the spoils taken from Syria, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites. They also included the spoils from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

(2 Samuel 8:13) 
David also gained great renown for himself when he returned from defeating twelve thousand enemies in the Valley of Salt. Although the Latin text says 'Syria,' this victory most likely refers to his conquest of Edom in that southern region, a battle where he struck down twelve thousand.

(2 Samuel 8:14) 
David then established garrisons throughout Idumea, also known as Edom, and as a result, the entire region of Idumea became completely subject to David. And, as before, the Lord God assisted David in every endeavor he undertook.

(2 Samuel 8:15) 
So David reigned as king over all of Israel, and he administered fair judgment and righteousness to all of his people.

(2 Samuel 8:16) 
Now, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was the commander of David’s army. And Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, served as the royal chronicler, responsible for keeping all official records.

(2 Samuel 8:17) 
Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, served as the principal priests. Seraiah was the royal secretary, handling official correspondence and state affairs.

(2 Samuel 8:18) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in command of the Cherethites and Pelethites, who were David’s personal elite guard. And David’s sons themselves held high office as royal ministers, called 'priests' in this context, indicating their sacred and prominent role in the kingdom.

(2 Samuel 9:1) 
Now David said, "Is there anyone left from the royal house of Saul, so that I may show kindness to him—fulfilling my covenant with Jonathan?"

(2 Samuel 9:2) 
Now there was a servant from Saul's household, named Ziba. When the king called him, David asked, "Are you Ziba?" And he replied, "I am your servant."

(2 Samuel 9:3) 
And the king asked, "Is there still anyone left from the house of Saul, that I may show him the kindness of God's covenant?" Ziba then said to the king, "Yes, there is still a son of Jonathan alive, but he is lame in both his feet."

(2 Samuel 9:4) 
David then asked, "Where is he?" And Ziba replied, "Behold, he is in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar."

(2 Samuel 9:5) 
So King David sent messengers, and they brought him from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.

(2 Samuel 9:6) 
When Mephibosheth (also known as Meribbaal), the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, came to David, he fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, "Mephibosheth?" He replied, "Behold, I am your servant."

(2 Samuel 9:7) 
And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will most certainly show you great kindness for the sake of Jonathan, your father. I will restore to you all the fields that belonged to Saul, your grandfather, and you shall always eat bread at my royal table."

(2 Samuel 9:8) 
He prostrated himself again and said, "What is your servant, that you would show regard for a dead dog such as I am?"

(2 Samuel 9:9) 
Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "Everything that belonged to Saul and his entire household, I have now given to your master's son—Mephibosheth."

(2 Samuel 9:10) 
"Therefore, you and your sons and your servants are to work the land for him. You shall bring in the produce so that your master's son may have food to eat and be provided for. Mephibosheth, your master's son, will always eat at my royal table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

(2 Samuel 9:11) 
Ziba said to the king, "Just as my lord the king has commanded, so your servant will do. Mephibosheth will eat at your table as one of the king's own sons."

(2 Samuel 9:12) 
Now Mephibosheth had a young son named Micah. And all the household of Ziba became servants to Mephibosheth.

(2 Samuel 9:13) 
So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table; and he was lame in both feet.

(2 Samuel 10:1) 
It happened after these events that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun began to reign in his place.

(2 Samuel 10:2) 
And David said, 'I will show kindness to Hanun, the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to console him over the death of his father. When David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites,

(2 Samuel 10:3) 
the princes of Ammon spoke to their lord Hanun: 'Do you really believe David has sent these comforters to you out of honor for your father? Is it not rather to spy out our city, to investigate its defenses, and to overthrow it?'

(2 Samuel 10:4) 
So Hanun seized David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut their outer garments off at the middle—up to their buttocks—and then sent them away in disgrace.

(2 Samuel 10:5) 
When this news was reported to David, he sent people to meet them, because the men were greatly humiliated. And David commanded them, saying: 'Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown out, and then you may return.'

(2 Samuel 10:6) 
But when the sons of Ammon realized what they had done to David and that they had made themselves utterly detestable to him, they sent and hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from Aram-Rehob and Aram-Zobah, one thousand men from the king of Maacah, and twelve thousand men from Ish-Tob.

(2 Samuel 10:7) 
When David heard this, he sent Joab and his entire army, which was made up of his most powerful warriors.

(2 Samuel 10:8) 
So the sons of Ammon came out and drew up their battle line at the entrance of the city gate. Meanwhile, the men of Aram-Rehob, Ish-Tob, Maacah, and Zobah were arrayed separately in the open field.

(2 Samuel 10:9) 
When Joab saw that the battle lines were set against him both in front and behind, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them for battle against the Arameans.

(2 Samuel 10:10) 
He gave the rest of the army to his brother Abishai, who arrayed them in a battle line against the sons of Ammon.

(2 Samuel 10:11) 
And Joab said to Abishai: 'If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you must come to my aid. But if the sons of Ammon prove too strong for you, then I will come to your aid.'

(2 Samuel 10:12) 
'Be strong! Let us act courageously for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord do what is good in His sight.'

(2 Samuel 10:13) 
So Joab and the people with him advanced into battle against the Arameans, who immediately fled from his presence.

(2 Samuel 10:14) 
When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from the presence of Abishai and retreated into their city. Then Joab returned from fighting the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 10:15) 
When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together for a fresh assault.

(2 Samuel 10:16) 
Hadadezer then sent for help and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River, and he brought with them Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, to lead them.

(2 Samuel 10:17) 
When this was reported to David, he gathered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. The Arameans arrayed their battle lines against David and fought against him.

(2 Samuel 10:18) 
The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen from among them. He also struck down Shobach, the commander of their army, who immediately died there.

(2 Samuel 10:19) 
When all the kings who were allies of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. After this, the Arameans were afraid to help the sons of Ammon anymore.

(2 Samuel 10:1) 
Now it came to pass after these events, that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanon began to reign in his place.

(2 Samuel 10:2) 
And David said: 'I will show kindness to Hanon, the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites,

(2 Samuel 10:3) 
the counselors of the Ammonites said to Hanon, their lord: 'Do you truly believe that David sent men to comfort you out of honor for your father? Or did he send them to spy out, to thoroughly search, and to overthrow our city?'

(2 Samuel 10:4) 
So Hanon took David's servants. He shaved off half of their beards and cut their garments in the middle, down to their buttocks, and then sent them away, inflicting deep shame upon them.

(2 Samuel 10:5) 
And when this humiliating event was reported to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. He commanded them, saying: 'Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.'

(2 Samuel 10:6) 
Therefore, the Ammonites, realizing they had become utterly contemptible in David's eyes after their insult, sent and hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from Aram-Rehob and Aram-Zobah. They also hired a thousand men from the king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Istob.

(2 Samuel 10:7) 
When David heard this, he sent Joab and the entire army of his most valiant men.

(2 Samuel 10:8) 
So the Ammonites went out and drew up their battle line at the entrance of their city gate. Meanwhile, the Arameans from Zobah, Rehob, Istob, and Maacah were positioned separately in the open field.

(2 Samuel 10:9) 
Therefore, Joab, seeing that the enemy battle lines were set against him both in front and in the rear, chose from among all of Israel's most valiant men and drew up his own battle line against the Arameans.

(2 Samuel 10:10) 
The remaining part of the people, he gave to his brother Abishai, who then drew up their battle line against the Ammonites.

(2 Samuel 10:11) 
And Joab said: 'If the Arameans prove stronger than I, you shall come to my aid. But if the Ammonites prove stronger than you, then I will come to your aid.'

(2 Samuel 10:12) 
'Be strong, and let us act bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord do what is good in His own sight.'

(2 Samuel 10:13) 
And when the battle began, the Arameans fled before Joab. And the Ammonites, seeing that the Arameans had fled, also fled from Abishai and entered their city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came back to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 10:14) 
But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together in one place.

(2 Samuel 10:15) 
So Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River, and he led their army to battle. Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, was over them.

(2 Samuel 10:16) 
And it was reported to David. So he gathered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. There they drew up their battle line against the Arameans and fought against them.

(2 Samuel 10:17) 
And the Arameans fled from before Israel. David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand cavalrymen. He also struck Shobach, their army commander, who immediately died there.

(2 Samuel 10:18) 
And all the kings who were under Hadadezer, seeing that they had been defeated by Israel, made peace with Israel and served them. The Arameans were then afraid to help the Ammonites any further.

(2 Samuel 10:19) 
Now it came to pass after these events, that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanon began to reign in his place.

(2 Samuel 11:1) 
Now it happened, as the year turned, at the time when kings typically go out to wage war, David sent Joab, along with his servants and all of Israel. They devastated the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. But David himself remained in Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 11:2) 
And it happened one evening, David rose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house. From there, he saw a woman washing herself. She was very beautiful.

(2 Samuel 11:3) 
So David sent messengers and inquired who the woman was. And a messenger said to him, 'Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?'

(2 Samuel 11:4) 
Then David sent messengers and had her brought to him. She came in to him, and he slept with her. She then immediately purified herself from the uncleanness of her menstrual cycle.

(2 Samuel 11:5) 
And she returned to her house, having conceived a child. And she sent word to David, saying, 'I have conceived.'

(2 Samuel 11:6) 
David then sent word to Joab, saying, 'Send Uriah the Hittite to me.' And Joab sent Uriah to David.

(2 Samuel 11:7) 
When Uriah came to David, David asked him how Joab was doing, how the people were doing, and how the war was going.

(2 Samuel 11:8) 
And David said to Uriah, 'Go to your house and wash your feet.' And when Uriah left the king's house, a portion from the king's table followed him, sent as a gift.

(2 Samuel 11:9) 
But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and he did not go into his own house.

(2 Samuel 11:10) 
It was reported to David by those who said, 'Uriah did not go into his house.' Then David said to Uriah, 'Have you not just come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?'

(2 Samuel 11:11) 
And Uriah said to David, 'The Ark of God, along with Israel and Judah, dwell in tents. And my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, remain in the open field. How then could I go into my own house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? By your life, and by the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.'

(2 Samuel 11:12) 
Then David said to Uriah, 'Remain here today, and tomorrow I will send you away.' So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.

(2 Samuel 11:13) 
David then called for him and made him eat and drink in his presence, and he made him drunk. But in the evening, Uriah went out and slept on his bed with the servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his own house.

(2 Samuel 11:14) 
So it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

(2 Samuel 11:15) 
In the letter, he wrote this command: 'Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle. Then, withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.'

(2 Samuel 11:16) 
Therefore, when Joab besieged the city, he placed Uriah in a spot where he knew there were very strong enemy fighters.

(2 Samuel 11:17) 
And the men of the city came out and fought against Joab. Some of the people, David's servants, fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died.

(2 Samuel 11:18) 
So Joab sent and reported to David all the words of the battle.

(2 Samuel 11:19) 
And he commanded the messenger, saying: 'When you have finished reporting all the details of the battle to the king,

(2 Samuel 11:20) 
If any of the king's anger is stirred, and he says, 'Why did you approach the wall to fight? Did you not know that many projectiles are usually thrown down from the wall from above?

(2 Samuel 11:21) 
Who struck down Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal? Did not a woman throw a piece of a millstone down on him from the wall and kill him at Thebez? Why did you approach so close to the wall?' Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'

(2 Samuel 11:22) 
So the messenger went and came to David and reported to him all that Joab had commanded him.

(2 Samuel 11:23) 
And the messenger said to David: 'The men of the city had the upper hand against us and came out against us in the open field. But we pursued them and drove them back all the way to the gate of the city.

(2 Samuel 11:24) 
And archers shot down from the wall upon your servants, and some of the king's servants died. Indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'

(2 Samuel 11:25) 
And David said to the messenger, 'Say this to Joab: 'Do not let this matter discourage you, for the outcome of war is unpredictable. The sword strikes now one way, now another. Press your warriors against the city to destroy it, and strengthen their resolve.''

(2 Samuel 11:26) 
Now when Uriah's wife heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.

(2 Samuel 11:27) 
After her period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her into his house. She became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.

(2 Samuel 11:1) 
Now it happened when the new year came—the time when kings typically march out to wage war—that King David sent Joab and his own personal guards with him, along with all the army of Israel. They attacked the Ammonites and laid siege to their city, Rabbah, but King David himself remained behind in Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 11:2) 
Then one day, as the evening was approaching, King David rose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's palace. From there he saw a woman bathing on the roof of her own house. The woman was exceptionally beautiful.

(2 Samuel 11:3) 
So the king sent messengers to inquire who the woman was. And it was reported back to him that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.

(2 Samuel 11:4) 
Therefore, King David sent messengers, and they brought her to him. She came in to him and he lay with her. She had just purified herself from her ritual uncleanness, meaning she was fertile. Afterwards, she returned to her house.

(2 Samuel 11:5) 
And the woman conceived a child. She then sent word to King David, saying: 'I have become pregnant.'

(2 Samuel 11:6) 
So King David sent word to Joab, saying: 'Send Uriah the Hittite to me.' And Joab sent Uriah to King David.

(2 Samuel 11:7) 
When Uriah came to King David, David asked him how Joab was, and how the soldiers were, and how the war was progressing.

(2 Samuel 11:8) 
Then King David said to Uriah: 'Go to your house, and wash your feet.' So Uriah departed from the king's house, and the king's servants carried a gift of food after him, as a sign of favor.

(2 Samuel 11:9) 
But Uriah slept outside the gate of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down into his own house.

(2 Samuel 11:10) 
And they reported to King David, saying: 'Uriah did not go down to his house.' King David then said to Uriah: 'Have you not just come from a journey? Why then did you not go down to your house?'

(2 Samuel 11:11) 
Uriah answered King David: 'The Ark of God, and all Israel, and Judah, are living in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field. And should I then go into my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? By your very life, and by the life of your soul, I will not do this thing!'

(2 Samuel 11:12) 
Then King David said to Uriah: 'Stay here also today, and tomorrow I will send you back to the army.' So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.

(2 Samuel 11:13) 
And King David invited him to eat and drink in his presence, and made him drunk. But Uriah still went out in the evening and slept on his pallet with the servants of his lord, and did not go down into his own house.

(2 Samuel 11:14) 
So it happened in the morning, King David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah himself.

(2 Samuel 11:15) 
Now in the letter he wrote, he gave these instructions: 'Place Uriah in the front line, where the battle is fiercest. Then withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.'

(2 Samuel 11:16) 
So when Joab was besieging the city, he placed Uriah in a spot where he knew there were the strongest, most valiant enemy soldiers.

(2 Samuel 11:17) 
And the men came out from the city and fought against Joab. Some of the soldiers, servants of King David, fell in battle, and Uriah the Hittite also died.

(2 Samuel 11:18) 
Then Joab sent and reported to King David all the details of the battle.

(2 Samuel 11:19) 
And he commanded the messenger, saying: 'When you have finished reporting all the words of the battle to the king—'

(2 Samuel 11:20) 
'—if perhaps the king should become angry and say: Why did you approach the wall to fight? Did you not know that whatever is thrown from the wall above can easily kill? For example—'

(2 Samuel 11:21) 
'—who killed Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal? Was it not a woman who threw a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and killed him in Thebez? Why did you approach so close to the wall? If he asks this, then you are to say: 'Indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.''

(2 Samuel 11:22) 
So the messenger went, and came to King David, and reported to him all that Joab had commanded him.

(2 Samuel 11:23) 
And the messenger said to King David: 'The men of the city overpowered us, and came out against us into the open field. And we fought them all the way to the gate of the city.'

(2 Samuel 11:24) 
'And archers shot arrows upon your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'

(2 Samuel 11:25) 
And King David said to the messenger: 'Thus you shall say to Joab: 'Do not let this matter discourage you. For the outcome of war is uncertain; sometimes the sword consumes one man, and sometimes another. Intensify the fight against the city, and overthrow it.' And with these words, David sought to encourage Joab.

(2 Samuel 11:26) 
Now when Uriah's wife heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.

(2 Samuel 11:27) 
And when her period of mourning was over, King David sent for her and brought her to his house, and she became his wife. Then she bore him a son. But the deed that King David had done was displeasing in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Samuel 12:1) 
The Lord then sent the prophet Nathan to King David. When Nathan came to David, he told him a story: 'There were two men in one city; one was very rich, and the other was very poor.'

(2 Samuel 12:2) 
The rich man owned many, many sheep and cattle.

(2 Samuel 12:3) 
But the poor man had nothing at all, except one tiny lamb. He had bought it and raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It would eat from his own plate, drink from his own cup, and sleep in his arms; it was like a daughter to him.

(2 Samuel 12:4) 
When a traveler came to the rich man, he refused to take from his own many sheep and cattle to prepare a meal for his guest, whom he had received as a visitor. Instead, he took the lamb of the poor man and prepared it for the person who had come to him.

(2 Samuel 12:5) 
David became very angry and indignant at the man, and he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! His action is a capital offense.'

(2 Samuel 12:6) 
'He must repay the lamb fourfold because he did such a thing and showed no mercy.'

(2 Samuel 12:7) 
Then Nathan said to David, 'You are that man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.'

(2 Samuel 12:8) 
'I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your possession. I also gave you the kingdom of Israel and Judah. If all this were too little, I would have added even more to you.'

(2 Samuel 12:9) 
'Why then have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in My sight? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with a sword, and you took his wife to be your own wife, and you killed him by the sword of the Ammonites.'

(2 Samuel 12:10) 
'Therefore, the sword will never depart from your house from this day forward, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own wife.'

(2 Samuel 12:11) 
'This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will bring disaster upon you from your own household. I will take your wives and give them to your neighbor before your very eyes, and he will sleep with your wives in the sight of the sun itself, openly and without shame.''

(2 Samuel 12:12) 
'For you acted in secret, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel and in the sight of the sun, making your sin publicly known.'

(2 Samuel 12:13) 
And David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord.' Nathan then said to David, 'The Lord has also removed your sin; you will not die immediately for it.'

(2 Samuel 12:14) 
'Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given the enemies of the Lord great occasion to blaspheme His name, the child who is born to you will surely die.'

(2 Samuel 12:15) 
Then Nathan returned to his own house. And the Lord struck the child whom Uriah's wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.

(2 Samuel 12:16) 
David pleaded with the Lord for the child. David fasted by going without food, and he went into his private chamber and lay on the ground all night.

(2 Samuel 12:17) 
So the elders of his household came to him to raise him from the ground, but he refused their help and would not eat any food with them.

(2 Samuel 12:18) 
On the seventh day, the child died. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, 'Look, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our words. How much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the boy is dead?'

(2 Samuel 12:19) 
But when David noticed his servants whispering among themselves, he understood that the child was dead. So he asked his servants, saying, 'Is the child dead?' And they answered him, 'He is dead.'

(2 Samuel 12:20) 
Then David arose from the ground, washed himself, anointed himself with oil, and changed his clothing. He went into the house of the Lord and worshiped there. Then he returned to his own house and requested food, and he ate.

(2 Samuel 12:21) 
His servants then said to him, 'What is this thing you have done? While the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. But now that the child is dead, you have risen and eaten bread.'

(2 Samuel 12:22) 
He replied, 'While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, because I thought to myself: 'Who knows? Perhaps the Lord will have mercy on me, and the child will live.''

(2 Samuel 12:23) 
'But now that the child is dead, why should I continue to fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him in death, but he will not return to me in life.'

(2 Samuel 12:24) 
And David comforted Bathsheba, his wife. He went in to her and slept with her. She conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. And the Lord loved this child.

(2 Samuel 12:25) 
And the Lord sent a message by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called the child's name Jedidiah (which means 'Beloved of the Lord'), because the Lord loved him.

(2 Samuel 12:26) 
Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and he captured the royal city, which was the capital.

(2 Samuel 12:27) 
And Joab sent messengers to David, saying, 'I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the city's water supply.'

(2 Samuel 12:28) 
'Now, therefore, gather the rest of the people and besiege the city yourself, and capture it. Do this so that when the city is taken, it will not be named after me, but after you.'

(2 Samuel 12:29) 
So David gathered all the people and went against Rabbah. He fought against it and captured it.

(2 Samuel 12:30) 
And David took the crown of their king from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, and it had precious stones embedded in it. It was then placed upon David's own head. He also carried away a very great amount of plunder from the city.

(2 Samuel 12:31) 
He also brought out the people who were in it and put them to forced labor with saws, with iron picks, and with iron axes. He made them pass through the brick kiln, meaning he subjected them to harsh, enslaving labor, including making bricks. He did this to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 13:1) 
After these events, Absalom, a son of King David, had a very beautiful sister named Tamar. Amnon, another son of King David, then fell deeply in love with her.

(2 Samuel 13:2) 
Amnon became so distressed over his sister Tamar that he fell sick and grew weak. This was because she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to act on his sinful desire for her.

(2 Samuel 13:3) 
Now, Amnon had a friend named Jonadab. Jonadab was the son of Shimeah, who was King David's brother—making him Amnon's cousin. Jonadab was an extremely shrewd and cunning man.

(2 Samuel 13:4) 
Jonadab asked Amnon, 'Why do you look so worn out and thin, O son of the king, day after day? Won't you tell me what's bothering you?' Amnon answered him, 'I am in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of my brother Absalom.'

(2 Samuel 13:5) 
Then Jonadab said to him, 'Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father, King David, comes to visit you, you must say to him: 'Please, let my sister Tamar come and prepare some food for me. Let her make me a special dish so I can eat it from her hand.''

(2 Samuel 13:6) 
So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. King David came to visit him. Amnon then said to the king, 'Please, let my sister Tamar come and make two little cakes right before my eyes, so I may eat from her hand.'

(2 Samuel 13:7) 
So King David sent word to Tamar at her home, saying, 'Please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.'

(2 Samuel 13:8) 
Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took flour, mixed it, and prepared it right before his eyes. Then she cooked the little cakes.

(2 Samuel 13:9) 
She took what she had cooked and set it before him, but he refused to eat. Amnon then said, 'Send everyone out from me.' So everyone was put out and left the room.

(2 Samuel 13:10) 
Amnon said to Tamar, 'Bring the food into the inner room so I can eat it from your hand.' Tamar then took the little cakes she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the inner room.

(2 Samuel 13:11) 
When she offered the food to him so he might eat, he seized her and said, 'Come, my sister, lie with me.'

(2 Samuel 13:12) 
She answered him, 'No, my brother, do not violate me! For such a thing is not allowed in Israel. Do not commit this utterly foolish and wicked act.'

(2 Samuel 13:13) 
For where would I go with my disgrace? And you would be considered like one of the most foolish and wicked men in Israel. Instead, why not speak to the king? He would not deny me to you in marriage, if you asked properly.'

(2 Samuel 13:14) 
But he refused to listen to her pleas. Instead, he overpowered her, disgraced her, and lay with her through force.

(2 Samuel 13:15) 
Then Amnon hated Tamar with an exceedingly great hatred. His hatred for her was greater than the love he had felt for her. And Amnon said to her, 'Get up and leave!'

(2 Samuel 13:16) 
Tamar said to him, 'No! This additional evil of casting me out now is even greater than the evil you have already done to me!' But Amnon refused to listen to her.

(2 Samuel 13:17) 
He called the young man who served him and said, 'Throw this woman out from me and lock the door behind her.'

(2 Samuel 13:18) 
Now, Tamar was wearing a long, full-sleeved tunic, which was the customary garment for royal virgins. So Amnon's servant put her out and locked the door behind her.

(2 Samuel 13:19) 
But Tamar, scattering ashes on her head and tearing the long, full-sleeved tunic she wore, put her hand upon her head and went away, crying out in great distress.

(2 Samuel 13:20) 
Her brother Absalom said to her, 'Was it not your brother Amnon who was with you? Now, then, be silent, my sister. He is your brother. Do not let this matter grieve your heart so much.' So Tamar remained desolate and disgraced in the house of her brother Absalom.

(2 Samuel 13:21) 
Now, King David heard about all these things and became exceedingly angry.

(2 Samuel 13:22) 
However, Absalom did not speak to Amnon, neither for good nor for evil—he did not confront him. For Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.

(2 Samuel 13:23) 
It happened after a period of two years that Absalom's sheep were being sheared in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim. Absalom then invited all the king's sons to a feast.

(2 Samuel 13:24) 
Absalom came to the king and said to him, 'Behold, your servant's sheep are being sheared. Please, let the king and his servants come to your servant's feast.'

(2 Samuel 13:25) 
But the king said to Absalom, 'No, my son, please, let us not all come, lest we be a burden to you.' Though Absalom urged him, King David refused to go, but he gave Absalom his blessing.

(2 Samuel 13:26) 
Then Absalom said, 'If you will not come, please let my brother Amnon at least come with us.' The king asked him, 'Why should he go with you?'

(2 Samuel 13:27) 
But Absalom pressed the king with his request, so David sent Amnon and all the rest of the king's sons with him.

(2 Samuel 13:28) 
Now Absalom had given orders to his young men, saying, 'Watch closely when Amnon's heart is cheerful with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon and kill him!' Do not be afraid! Have I not commanded you? Be strong and show yourselves to be brave men!'

(2 Samuel 13:29) 
So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded them. Then all the other sons of the king rose up, each mounted his mule, and they fled.

(2 Samuel 13:30) 
While they were still on the way, a rumor reached King David, saying, 'Absalom has killed all the king's sons, and not even one of them remains alive!'

(2 Samuel 13:31) 
Then the king arose, tore his royal garments, and fell to the ground. All his servants who stood by him also tore their own garments in sorrow.

(2 Samuel 13:32) 
But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, spoke up and said, 'Let not my lord the king think that all the young men, the king's sons, have been killed. Only Amnon is dead. For this was planned by Absalom from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.'

(2 Samuel 13:33) 
'Therefore, now let not my lord the king take it to heart, thinking: 'All the king's sons are dead.' For only Amnon is dead.'

(2 Samuel 13:34) 
Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. And the young watchman lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a large company of people were coming by way of the road along the side of the mountain, through the winding paths.

(2 Samuel 13:35) 
Then Jonadab said to the king, 'Behold, the king's sons are coming! It has happened just as I said it would.'

(2 Samuel 13:36) 
As soon as he finished speaking, the king's sons appeared. They raised their voices and wept loudly. And the king also, with all his servants, wept with an exceedingly great lamentation.

(2 Samuel 13:37) 
But Absalom, having fled, went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. So King David mourned for his son Amnon for many days.

(2 Samuel 13:38) 
When Absalom had fled and arrived in Geshur, he remained there for three years.

(2 Samuel 13:39) 
And King David ceased pursuing Absalom, for he had been comforted over Amnon, seeing that he was dead.

(2 Samuel 13:40) 
This verse does not exist in the Clementine Vulgate for 2 Samuel Chapter 13.

(2 Samuel 13:1) 
Now after these events, Absalom, a son of King David, had a very beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, another son of David, fell in love with her.

(2 Samuel 13:2) 
Amnon was so distressed over her that he became sick, wasting away because of Tamar, his sister. For she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible in Amnon's eyes to do anything with her.

(2 Samuel 13:3) 
But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of Shimeah (David's brother). Jonadab was a very cunning man.

(2 Samuel 13:4) 
Jonadab said to Amnon, 'Why are you so wasted away, son of the king, day after day? Why don't you tell me?' Amnon replied to him, 'I love Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.'

(2 Samuel 13:5) 
Jonadab then said to him, 'Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to visit you, you must say to him: 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food. Let her prepare some warm food in my presence, so I can see it and eat from her hand.'

(2 Samuel 13:6) 
So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. The king came to visit him. Amnon then said to the king, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and make two small portions of food in my presence, so I may eat from her hand.'

(2 Samuel 13:7) 
So King David sent word to Tamar at her home, saying, 'Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.'

(2 Samuel 13:8) 
Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took flour, mixed it, and prepared the small portions of food in his sight, cooking them.

(2 Samuel 13:9) 
Then she took what she had cooked and served it to him. But he refused to eat. Amnon said, 'Send everyone away from me!' So all the servants were sent out and left the room.

(2 Samuel 13:10) 
Amnon then said to Tamar, 'Bring the food into the inner room, so I may eat from your hand.' Tamar took the portions she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the inner room.

(2 Samuel 13:11) 
As she offered it to him, he seized her and said, 'Come, lie down with me, my sister.'

(2 Samuel 13:12) 
She answered him, 'No, my brother, do not do violence to me! For such a thing is not permitted in Israel; do not commit this foolish act.'

(2 Samuel 13:13) 
'And where would I go to hide my disgrace? And you, my brother, would become like one of the foolish men in Israel. Why not speak to the king instead? He would not refuse to give me to you in marriage.'

(2 Samuel 13:14) 
But he refused to listen to her pleas. Instead, overpowering her, he did violence to her and lay with her.

(2 Samuel 13:15) 
Then Amnon hated Tamar with an exceedingly great hatred, so much that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her before. And Amnon said to her, 'Get up and go away!'

(2 Samuel 13:16) 
Tamar said to him, 'No, this evil of sending me away is greater than the other evil you have already done to me.' But he would not listen to her.

(2 Samuel 13:17) 
He called his servant who attended him and said, 'Throw this woman out from my presence and bolt the door behind her!'

(2 Samuel 13:18) 
Now she was wearing a long, sleeved tunic. For such garments were worn by the virgin daughters of kings. So his servant threw her out and bolted the door behind her.

(2 Samuel 13:19) 
Tamar then sprinkled dust on her head, tore her sleeved tunic, put her hand upon her head, and went away, walking and crying out in distress.

(2 Samuel 13:20) 
Her brother Absalom said to her, 'Was your brother Amnon with you? But now, sister, be silent, for he is your brother. Do not let this matter grieve your heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.

(2 Samuel 13:21) 
Now King David heard about all these things and was greatly distressed.

(2 Samuel 13:22) 
However, Absalom did not speak to Amnon, neither good nor evil. For Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.

(2 Samuel 13:23) 
Now after two full years, Absalom's sheep were being sheared in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim. And Absalom invited all the king's sons.

(2 Samuel 13:24) 
Absalom came to the king and said to him, 'Behold, your servant's sheep are being sheared. Please, let the king and his servants come with your servant.'

(2 Samuel 13:25) 
But the king said to Absalom, 'No, my son, please, do not let us all go, lest we be a burden to you.' Though Absalom urged him, David would not go, but he blessed him instead.

(2 Samuel 13:26) 
Absalom said, 'If you will not come, please, let my brother Amnon at least come with us.' The king asked him, 'Why should he go with you?'

(2 Samuel 13:27) 
But Absalom urged him so strongly that David sent Amnon and all the king's other sons with him.

(2 Samuel 13:28) 
Now Absalom had given orders to his young men, saying, 'Watch when Amnon's heart is cheerful from wine. And when I tell you: Strike Amnon and kill him, do not be afraid! Is it not I who command you? Be courageous and be strong men!'

(2 Samuel 13:29) 
So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's other sons quickly rose, and each one mounted his mule and fled.

(2 Samuel 13:30) 
While they were still on the way, a rumor reached King David, saying, 'Absalom has struck down all the king's sons! Not even one of them remains!'

(2 Samuel 13:31) 
So the king rose, tore his clothes, and fell to the ground. And all his servants who stood by him also tore their clothes.

(2 Samuel 13:32) 
But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah (David's brother), answered and said, 'Let not my lord the king imagine that all the young men, the king's sons, have been killed. Only Amnon is dead. For this was determined by Absalom from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.'

(2 Samuel 13:33) 
Therefore, let not my lord the king take it to heart now, thinking: 'All the king's sons are dead.' For only Amnon is dead.

(2 Samuel 13:34) 
Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. And the young watchman lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a large crowd of people were coming down the road on the side of the mountain.

(2 Samuel 13:35) 
Jonadab then said to the king, 'Look! The king's sons are coming! What your servant said has happened.'

(2 Samuel 13:36) 
As soon as he finished speaking, the king's sons appeared, and they raised their voices and wept. Even the king and all his servants wept with an exceedingly great lamentation.

(2 Samuel 13:37) 
Absalom, however, fled and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. So David mourned for his son Amnon for many days.

(2 Samuel 13:38) 
Absalom, after he fled and arrived in Geshur, remained there for three years.

(2 Samuel 13:39) 
And King David ceased from pursuing Absalom, because he had become reconciled to Amnon's death.

(2 Samuel 13:40) 
And Amnon died.

(2 Samuel 14:1) 
Therefore, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, knew that King David’s heart was longing for Absalom.

(2 Samuel 14:2) 
So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there. He said to her: 'Pretend to be in mourning, and put on the clothes of a mourner. Do not anoint yourself with oil, so that you look like a woman who has been mourning a dead person for a long time.'

(2 Samuel 14:3) 
Then go to the king and speak these exact words to him.' And Joab carefully instructed her on everything she was to say.

(2 Samuel 14:4) 
So the woman from Tekoa came to the king, fell before him to the ground, and bowed down, saying, 'Help me, King!'

(2 Samuel 14:5) 
The king asked her, 'What is troubling you?' She answered, 'Alas! I am a widow, and my husband is dead.'

(2 Samuel 14:6) 
'And your handmaid had two sons. They fought against each other in the field, and there was no one to intervene and separate them. One struck the other and killed him.'

(2 Samuel 14:7) 
'And behold, the whole family has risen up against your handmaid, saying: "Hand over the one who struck his brother, so we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir!" They are seeking to extinguish the only remaining spark of my family, so that my husband will have no name or descendants left on the earth.'

(2 Samuel 14:8) 
The king said to the woman, 'Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.'

(2 Samuel 14:9) 
The woman from Tekoa said to the king, 'My lord king, let the guilt be on me and on my father’s house; but may you, O king, and your throne, be free from all blame.'

(2 Samuel 14:10) 
The king said, 'Whoever speaks against you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again.'

(2 Samuel 14:11) 
She said, 'I beg you, King, remember the Lord your God, so that the avenger of blood may not multiply the killing, and not destroy my son.' The king responded, 'As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground!'

(2 Samuel 14:12) 
Then the woman said, 'May your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.' He said, 'Speak.'

(2 Samuel 14:13) 
The woman then said, 'Why then have you thought of such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this, the king implicates himself as a sinner, since he does not bring back his own banished son.'

(2 Samuel 14:14) 
'We all must die, and we are like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not desire for a soul to perish, but rather thinks of ways that the banished one may not be utterly cut off.'

(2 Samuel 14:15) 
'Now, therefore, I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, out of fear of the people. And your handmaid thought: "I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant his handmaid’s request."'

(2 Samuel 14:16) 
'For the king heard me, and will deliver his handmaid from the power of the man who seeks to banish me, and to completely cut off me and my son from God’s inheritance.'

(2 Samuel 14:17) 
'Your handmaid said: "May the word of my lord the king be like the angel of God, for my lord the king is truly discerning, able to distinguish between good and evil. And may the Lord your God be with you."'

(2 Samuel 14:18) 
The king answered and said to the woman, 'Do not hide from me the word that I am about to ask you.' The woman said, 'Let my lord the king speak.'

(2 Samuel 14:19) 
The king said, 'Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?' The woman answered and said, 'As your soul lives, my lord king, it is impossible to deviate to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king has said. For you are wise, like an angel of God, to understand all things on the earth.'

(2 Samuel 14:20) 
'Therefore, for this very reason, your servant Joab did this thing: to change the appearance of my speech and plead the case. But you, my lord, are as wise as the wisdom of an angel of God, so you understand all things that happen on earth.'

(2 Samuel 14:21) 
The king then said to Joab, 'Behold, I have granted your request. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.'

(2 Samuel 14:22) 
Joab fell to the ground on his face, bowed down, and blessed the king. Joab said, 'Blessed be the soul of your servant today, because I have found favor in your sight, my lord king, and you have granted your servant’s request.'

(2 Samuel 14:23) 
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 14:24) 
But the king said, 'Let him return to his own house, and not see my face.' So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.

(2 Samuel 14:25) 
Now, Absalom was the most handsome man in all of Israel, and exceedingly beautiful. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him.

(2 Samuel 14:26) 
When he cut his hair once a year—because his hair would become very heavy, it would be shorn—the hair from his head weighed two hundred shekels by the royal standard.

(2 Samuel 14:27) 
Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter whose name was Tamar, a woman of outstanding beauty.

(2 Samuel 14:28) 
Absalom remained in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king’s face.

(2 Samuel 14:29) 
So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. When Absalom sent a second time, and Joab still refused to come,

(2 Samuel 14:30) 
Absalom said to his servants, 'Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.' So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.

(2 Samuel 14:31) 
Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and asked, 'Why did your servants set my field on fire?'

(2 Samuel 14:32) 
Absalom answered Joab, 'I sent word to you, saying: "Come to me, so I can send you to the king, to tell him: 'Why did I even come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to stay there.'" So I beg you, let me see the king’s face. If there is any guilt in me, then kill me.'

(2 Samuel 14:33) 
So Joab came to the king and told him everything. Then Absalom was called, and he entered the king’s presence. He bowed down to the ground before the king, and King David kissed Absalom.

(2 Samuel 14:1) 
So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, knew that King David's heart was yearning for Absalom.

(2 Samuel 14:2) 
Joab sent for a wise woman from Tekoa and brought her to him. And he said to her: 'Pretend to be in mourning. Wear mourning clothes and do not put any oil on your body, so that you appear like a woman who has been mourning a dead person for many days.'

(2 Samuel 14:3) 
Then go to the king and speak these words to him.' Joab put the exact words she was to say into her mouth.

(2 Samuel 14:4) 
So when the woman from Tekoa came to the king, she fell before him on her face, bowed down, and said: 'Help me, my King!'

(2 Samuel 14:5) 
The king said to her: 'What troubles you?' She answered: 'Alas, I am a widow, and my husband is dead.'

(2 Samuel 14:6) 
And your handmaid had two sons. They quarreled with each other in the field, and there was no one to separate them. So one struck the other and killed him.

(2 Samuel 14:7) 
And behold, all the relatives rose up against your handmaid, saying: 'Hand over the one who struck his brother, so we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he murdered, and destroy the heir!' They are threatening to wipe out my only remaining family and prevent my husband's name and descendants from continuing on the earth.

(2 Samuel 14:8) 
The king said to the woman: 'Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.'

(2 Samuel 14:9) 
The woman from Tekoa said to the king: 'My Lord, my King, let the guilt be on me and on my father's house. But let the king and his throne be innocent.'

(2 Samuel 14:10) 
The king said: 'Whoever speaks against you, bring him to me, and he will not trouble you again.'

(2 Samuel 14:11) 
She said: 'May the king remember the Lord his God, so that the avenger of blood does not multiply his vengeance and by no means kill my son.' The king then swore: 'As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son's head shall fall to the ground!'

(2 Samuel 14:12) 
Then the woman said: 'May your handmaid speak a word to my lord, the king.'

(2 Samuel 14:13) 
He said: 'Speak.' And the woman said: 'Why then do you intend such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word, the king condemns himself, because he does not recall his own banished son, Absalom.'

(2 Samuel 14:14) 
We all must die, and we are like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. God does not take away a soul instantly but rather devises ways for the banished to not perish, that they may be brought back.

(2 Samuel 14:15) 
So now, I have come to speak this word to my lord, the king, fearing that perhaps the people might frighten me. And your handmaid said: 'I will speak to the king, if perhaps the king will grant his handmaid's request.'

(2 Samuel 14:16) 
For the king will surely listen and deliver his handmaid from the hand of any man who would try to disinherit both me and my son from the Lord's inheritance.

(2 Samuel 14:17) 
And your handmaid said: 'May the word of my lord the king bring me peace.' For my lord the king is like an angel of God, discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.

(2 Samuel 14:18) 
The king answered and said to the woman: 'Do not hide from me the word I am about to ask you.'

(2 Samuel 14:19) 
The woman said: 'Let my lord the king speak.' And the king said: 'Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?'

(2 Samuel 14:20) 
The woman answered and said: 'By the life of your soul, my lord the king, nothing you have said turns to the right or to the left from what your handmaid has uttered. For my lord the king, you are as wise as an angel of God, able to understand all things on earth. Your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he himself put all these words into the mouth of your handmaid.'

(2 Samuel 14:21) 
Therefore, I spoke this word to bring about justice in this matter, for your servant Joab instructed me to do so.

(2 Samuel 14:22) 
And your handmaid spoke to my lord the king, as if to fulfill the purpose of these words. For you, my lord the king, are like an angel of God in your understanding of all things. Therefore, do as you see fit in your wisdom.

(2 Samuel 14:23) 
The king then said to Joab: 'See, I have granted your request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.'

(2 Samuel 14:24) 
Joab fell on his face to the ground, bowed down, and blessed the king. And Joab said: 'Today your servant understands that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request.'

(2 Samuel 14:25) 
So Joab brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 14:26) 
The king said: 'Let him return to his own house and not see my face.' So Absalom returned to his house and did not see the king's face.

(2 Samuel 14:27) 
Now, three sons and one daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter's name was Tamar, and she was very beautiful.

(2 Samuel 14:28) 
Absalom remained in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king's face.

(2 Samuel 14:29) 
So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. When Absalom sent a second time, Joab still did not come.

(2 Samuel 14:30) 
Then Absalom said to his servants: 'See, Joab's field is next to mine, and it has a barley crop. Go and set it on fire!' So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

(2 Samuel 14:31) 
Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house, and said: 'Why did your servants set my field on fire?'

(2 Samuel 14:32) 
Absalom answered Joab: 'I sent to you, saying: 'Come here, so I may send you to the king to ask him: 'Why did I return from Geshur? It would have been better for me to have remained there.'' Therefore, I beg you, let me see the king's face. If there is any guilt in me, then let him put me to death.'

(2 Samuel 14:33) 
So Joab went to the king and told him. And Absalom was called. He entered the king's presence and bowed down on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

(2 Samuel 15:1) 
After these events, Absalom began to act like a king. He provided for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

(2 Samuel 15:2) 
Absalom would rise early in the morning and stand at the entrance of the city gate. When anyone had a dispute to bring before the king for judgment, Absalom would call him over and ask, 'From what city are you?' The man would answer, 'Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.'

(2 Samuel 15:3) 
Then Absalom would say to him, 'Your case seems good and just to me, but there is no official appointed by the king to hear your complaint.'

(2 Samuel 15:4) 
Absalom would then add, 'Oh, if only someone would appoint me judge over the land! Then everyone with a dispute could come to me, and I would give them justice.'

(2 Samuel 15:5) 
When anyone approached Absalom to pay him homage, Absalom would extend his hand, take hold of the person, and kiss him.

(2 Samuel 15:6) 
Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment, and he slowly stole the hearts of the people of Israel.

(2 Samuel 15:7) 
After four years of this, Absalom said to King David, 'Let me go to Hebron, so I may fulfill a vow I made to the Lord there.'

(2 Samuel 15:8) 
For your servant made a vow while living in Geshur in Syria, saying: 'If the Lord brings me back to Jerusalem, I will offer a sacrifice to Him.''

(2 Samuel 15:9) 
The king said to him, 'Go in peace.' So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.

(2 Samuel 15:10) 
But Absalom also sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, telling them: 'As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, declare: "Absalom has become king in Hebron!"'

(2 Samuel 15:11) 
Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They were invited guests, completely unaware of his true intentions and went with sincere hearts.

(2 Samuel 15:12) 
And Ahithophel the Gilonite, who was David's personal advisor, came from his city of Giloh and joined Absalom. The conspiracy became strong, and the number of people gathering with Absalom continually increased.

(2 Samuel 15:13) 
So a messenger came to David, saying: 'The hearts of all Israel are following Absalom!'

(2 Samuel 15:14) 
David then said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem: 'Get up, let us flee! Otherwise, there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry and leave, so that he doesn't overtake us, bring disaster upon us, and put the city to the sword.'

(2 Samuel 15:15) 
The king's servants said to him: 'Whatever our lord the king commands, your servants are ready to do it willingly.'

(2 Samuel 15:16) 
So the king went out, along with his entire household and all the people who followed him. But the king left behind ten concubine women to guard the palace.

(2 Samuel 15:17) 
The king went out, and all the people of Israel followed on foot. He stopped at a house that was some distance away from the city.

(2 Samuel 15:18) 
All his servants marched past him; and all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, marched on foot before the king.

(2 Samuel 15:19) 
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: 'Why are you coming with us? Go back and stay with the new king Absalom, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own homeland.'

(2 Samuel 15:20) 
You only arrived yesterday, and now should you be forced to wander with us today? I am going wherever I must go. Go back, and take your fellow countrymen with you. May the Lord show you mercy and faithfulness.

(2 Samuel 15:21) 
But Ittai answered the king, saying: 'As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means death or life, there your servant will be!'

(2 Samuel 15:22) 
David said to Ittai: 'Come then, and pass by.' So Ittai the Gittite passed by, with all his men and all the little children who were with him.

(2 Samuel 15:23) 
All the land wept with a loud voice as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people headed toward the road that leads to the desert.

(2 Samuel 15:24) 
And behold, Zadok came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar also came up, waiting until all the people had finished leaving the city.

(2 Samuel 15:25) 
Then the king said to Zadok: 'Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and show me both the ark and His dwelling place.'

(2 Samuel 15:26) 
But if He says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let Him do to me whatever seems good in His sight.'

(2 Samuel 15:27) 
The king also said to Zadok the priest: 'Do you understand? Return to the city in peace. And let your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan—your two sons—be with you.'

(2 Samuel 15:28) 
'Look, I will hide in the plains of the desert until a message comes from you to inform me.'

(2 Samuel 15:29) 
So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.

(2 Samuel 15:30) 
Meanwhile, David went up the slope of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he climbed. His head was covered, and he walked barefoot. All the people who were with him also walked with their heads covered, weeping as they went.

(2 Samuel 15:31) 
Someone informed David, saying: 'Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.' And David said: 'Please, Lord, make the counsel of Ahithophel foolish.'

(2 Samuel 15:32) 
When David reached the top of the mountain, where people worshipped the Lord, suddenly Hushai the Archite met him with his tunic torn and dirt on his head.

(2 Samuel 15:33) 
And David said to him: 'If you come with me, you will be a burden to me.'

(2 Samuel 15:34) 
'But if you return to the city and say to Absalom: "I am your servant, O king! Just as I was your father's servant, so now I will be yours," then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me.'

(2 Samuel 15:35) 
'You will have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there. Every word you hear from the king's household, you must report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.'

(2 Samuel 15:36) 
'Indeed, they have their two sons with them: Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. Through them, you can send me every message you hear.'

(2 Samuel 15:37) 
So Hushai, David's loyal friend, went back into the city. Just as Hushai entered, Absalom also entered Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 15:1) 
After these events, Absalom acquired for himself chariots and horsemen, and also fifty men who would run before him, establishing a royal display.

(2 Samuel 15:2) 
And rising early in the morning, Absalom would stand beside the main entrance of the city gate—the place where legal cases were heard. When a man had a dispute and was on his way to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and ask: "From what city are you?" The man would reply: "I am your servant, from one of the tribes of Israel."

(2 Samuel 15:3) 
Then Absalom would say to him: "Your case is sound and just, but unfortunately, there is no one appointed by the king to properly hear you."

(2 Samuel 15:4) 
And he would add with a sigh: "If only someone would make me judge over the land! Then everyone with a dispute could come to me, and I would certainly give them justice."

(2 Samuel 15:5) 
And if a person would approach to show him deference—by bowing down—Absalom would extend his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.

(2 Samuel 15:6) 
Absalom acted in this way with every Israelite who came for judgment, and by doing so, he stole the loyalty of the men of Israel.

(2 Samuel 15:7) 
After four years had passed, Absalom said to the king: "Please allow me to go to Hebron, so that I may fulfill the vow I made to the Lord there."

(2 Samuel 15:8) 
He added: "For while your servant was in Geshur in Syria, I made a vow saying: 'If the Lord brings me back to Jerusalem, I will offer a sacrifice to Him.'"

(2 Samuel 15:9) 
And the king said to him: "Go in peace." So Absalom rose and went to Hebron.

(2 Samuel 15:10) 
But Absalom had secretly sent messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel with this instruction: "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, declare: 'Absalom is now king in Hebron!'"

(2 Samuel 15:11) 
Furthermore, two hundred men from Jerusalem, who had been invited by Absalom, went with him, completely unaware of his secret plot.

(2 Samuel 15:12) 
Achitophel the Gilonite, David's trusted advisor, also came from his city of Giloh and joined Absalom. The conspiracy grew strong, and the number of people gathering with Absalom continually increased.

(2 Samuel 15:13) 
So a messenger came to David, reporting: "The hearts of all Israel have turned completely to Absalom."

(2 Samuel 15:14) 
Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem: "Get up, let us flee! Otherwise, there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry and leave, lest he quickly overtake us, surround us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."

(2 Samuel 15:15) 
The king's servants responded to him: "Whatever our lord the king commands, we, your faithful servants, are ready to do it all."

(2 Samuel 15:16) 
So the king departed, and his entire household followed on foot. However, the king left behind ten concubines to guard the palace.

(2 Samuel 15:17) 
The king and all the people following in his footsteps went out, and then they stopped at a distant house.

(2 Samuel 15:18) 
All his servants passed by him, along with all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites—his personal guard. All six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath also passed by before the king.

(2 Samuel 15:19) 
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: "Why are you coming with us? Go back and stay with the new king Absalom, for you are a foreigner, and you are an exile from your own land."

(2 Samuel 15:20) 
"You only arrived yesterday, and today you are forced to leave with us? I am going wherever I must go. Return, and take your countrymen with you. May the Lord show you steadfast love and faithfulness."

(2 Samuel 15:21) 
But Ittai replied to the king: "As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be—whether it leads to death or to life—there your servant will be also."

(2 Samuel 15:22) 
David then said to Ittai: "Come, cross over with us." So Ittai the Gittite passed over, with all his men and all the families with him.

(2 Samuel 15:23) 
And all the inhabitants of the land wept with a loud voice as the entire populace passed over. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people headed toward the road leading to the wilderness.

(2 Samuel 15:24) 
And behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar went up and offered sacrifices, until all the people had finished leaving the city.

(2 Samuel 15:25) 
Then the king said to Zadok: "Carry the Ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and allow me to see it and His dwelling place again."

(2 Samuel 15:26) 
"But if He says to me: 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let Him do to me whatever seems good in His sight."

(2 Samuel 15:27) 
The king also said to Zadok the priest: "Do you understand? Return to the city in peace. And your son Ahimaaz, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son—your two sons—let them be with you.

(2 Samuel 15:28) 
Look, I will hide myself by the fords in the wilderness, until a message comes from you to inform me of the situation."

(2 Samuel 15:29) 
So Zadok and Abiathar carried the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.

(2 Samuel 15:30) 
Meanwhile, David was ascending the slope of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered, and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning and humiliation. All the people who were with him also ascended with covered heads, weeping.

(2 Samuel 15:31) 
Then it was reported to David: "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom!" And David prayed: "Please, Lord, make Ahithophel's counsel foolish."

(2 Samuel 15:32) 
As David reached the summit of the mountain—the place where the Lord was worshipped—there, Hushai the Archite came to meet him, with his tunic torn and dust sprinkled on his head as a sign of distress.

(2 Samuel 15:33) 
And David said to him: "If you come with me, you will be a burden to me:

(2 Samuel 15:34) 
But if you return to the city and say to Absalom: 'I am your servant, O king; just as I was your father's servant, so now I will be your servant,' then you can thwart Ahithophel's counsel for me."

(2 Samuel 15:35) 
Furthermore, Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, are there with you. Every word you hear from the king's household, you must report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

(2 Samuel 15:36) 
For their two sons are there with them: Zadok's son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar's son Jonathan. Through them, you will send me every message that you hear."

(2 Samuel 15:37) 
So Hushai, David's friend, returned to the city. And Absalom was entering Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 16:1) 
When King David had gone a little way past the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, appeared before him, coming to meet him. Ziba had with him a pair of donkeys, loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred baskets of summer fruits, and a wineskin filled with wine.

(2 Samuel 16:2) 
Then the king asked Ziba, 'What is the purpose of these things you have brought?' Ziba answered, 'The donkeys are for your household servants to ride upon. The bread and summer fruits are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who grows weary and thirsty in the desert to drink.'

(2 Samuel 16:3) 
The king then asked, 'Where is your master's son, Mephibosheth?' And Ziba answered the king, 'He has remained in Jerusalem, saying, 'Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.'

(2 Samuel 16:4) 
Then the king said to Ziba, 'Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.' Ziba replied, 'I bow low and plead that I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O King.'

(2 Samuel 16:5) 
So King David came to Bahurim. And behold, a man from the kindred of the house of Saul came out from there, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came forward, cursing as he approached.

(2 Samuel 16:6) 
He began throwing stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people, and all the strongest warriors, were walking on his right and on his left side.

(2 Samuel 16:7) 
And this is what Shimei said as he cursed the king: 'Get out! Get out, you man of bloodshed, and you worthless man!'

(2 Samuel 16:8) 
The Lord has brought back upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, because you seized his kingdom. And the Lord has now given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. And behold, your own evil deeds are pressing down upon you, because you are a man of bloodshed.

(2 Samuel 16:9) 
Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and cut off his head!'

(2 Samuel 16:10) 
But the king said, 'What business is it of mine or yours, O sons of Zeruiah? Let him curse. For the Lord himself has commanded him to curse David, and who is there who dares to say, 'Why have you done this?'

(2 Samuel 16:11) 
And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, 'Behold, my own son, who came out from my body, seeks my life. How much more so should this Benjaminite be allowed to curse? Let him curse, according to the Lord's command.

(2 Samuel 16:12) 
Perhaps the Lord will look upon my affliction and repay me with good for this cursing I endure today.

(2 Samuel 16:13) 
So David and his companions went on their way. But Shimei walked on the side of the mountain ridge, cursing as he went, and throwing stones at David and scattering dust.

(2 Samuel 16:14) 
And the king and all the people with him arrived, weary, and refreshed themselves there.

(2 Samuel 16:15) 
Meanwhile, Absalom and all the people of Israel with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.

(2 Samuel 16:16) 
But when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, he spoke to him, saying, 'Long live the king! Long live the king!'

(2 Samuel 16:17) 
And Absalom said to Hushai, 'Is this how you show loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend David?'

(2 Samuel 16:18) 
Hushai answered Absalom, 'No, that is not the case. But instead, the one whom the Lord has chosen, and this people, and all of Israel, I will be his servant, and I will remain with him.'

(2 Samuel 16:19) 
And furthermore, whose servant am I? Am I not the servant of your father? Just as I served before your father, so I will serve before you.

(2 Samuel 16:20) 
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, 'Give your counsel now: what should we do?'

(2 Samuel 16:21) 
And Ahithophel said to Absalom, 'Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left behind to guard the house. For when all Israel hears that you have made yourself utterly detestable to your father, the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.'

(2 Samuel 16:22) 
So Absalom had a tent pitched on the roof of the palace, and he went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

(2 Samuel 16:23) 
Now the counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was considered as if it were an oracle from the word of God. Such was all the counsel of Ahithophel, both when he was with David and now when he was with Absalom.

(2 Samuel 16:1) 
As King David had gone a little way past the top of the mountain (specifically, the Mount of Olives), Mephibosheth's servant, Ziba, appeared to meet him. Ziba was bringing two saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred bunches of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a wineskin full of wine.

(2 Samuel 16:2) 
Then the king asked Ziba, "What are these things for?" Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king and his household to ride on. The bread and fruit are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who grows faint in the wilderness to drink."

(2 Samuel 16:3) 
And the king asked, "Where is your master's son, Mephibosheth?" Ziba answered the king, "He has stayed behind in Jerusalem, saying, 'Today the house of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me.'"

(2 Samuel 16:4) 
Then the king said to Ziba, "Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." Ziba replied, "I bow down to you, my lord the king; I pray that I may always find favor in your sight."

(2 Samuel 16:5) 
So King David arrived at Bahurim, and behold, a man from the clan of Saul's family, named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there. He was walking along and cursing David as he came.

(2 Samuel 16:6) 
And Shimei threw stones at King David and at all of King David's servants. All the people and all the mighty warriors were walking on the king's right and on his left side.

(2 Samuel 16:7) 
This is what Shimei said as he cursed the king: "Get out! Get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!"

(2 Samuel 16:8) 
The Lord has made you pay back for all the bloodshed of Saul's house, because you seized his kingdom. Now the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Look, your own evil deeds have caught up with you, because you are a man of blood.

(2 Samuel 16:9) 
Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!"

(2 Samuel 16:10) 
But the king said, "What concern is this of yours and mine, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him curse. For the Lord Himself has commanded him to curse David; and who would dare to say, 'Why have you done this?'"

(2 Samuel 16:11) 
And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my own son, who came from my own body, is trying to take my life! How much more, then, should this Benjaminite be allowed to curse? Let him curse, for the Lord has commanded it."

(2 Samuel 16:12) 
Perhaps the Lord will look upon my affliction, and the Lord will repay me with good instead of this cursing I receive today.

(2 Samuel 16:13) 
So David and his companions continued on their way. Shimei kept walking along the side of the mountain ridge opposite them, cursing as he went, and throwing stones at King David, and continuously kicking up dust toward him.

(2 Samuel 16:14) 
Thus the king and all the people with him, being tired, arrived at the Jordan River, and they rested there to refresh themselves.

(2 Samuel 16:15) 
Meanwhile, Absalom and all the people of Israel with him had entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.

(2 Samuel 16:16) 
Now when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, he said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"

(2 Samuel 16:17) 
And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this the loyalty you show your friend? Why did you not go with your friend, King David?"

(2 Samuel 16:18) 
And Hushai answered Absalom, "By no means! Rather, whomever the Lord, and this people, and all of Israel have chosen, I will be with him, and I will remain with him."

(2 Samuel 16:19) 
Furthermore, whom should I serve next? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.

(2 Samuel 16:20) 
Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your counsel; what should we do?"

(2 Samuel 16:21) 
And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left behind to guard the house. Then all of Israel will hear that you have made yourself detestable to your father, and the resolve of all who are with you will be strengthened." (This act symbolically and literally cut off any reconciliation with David and asserted Absalom's claim to the throne).

(2 Samuel 16:22) 
So Absalom had a tent pitched on the roof of the palace, and he went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

(2 Samuel 16:23) 
Now the counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was as if one consulted the oracle of God. Such was all of Ahithophel's counsel, both when he was with David and when he was with Absalom. (This highlights Ahithophel's reputation for wisdom and the gravity of his advice).

(2 Samuel 17:1) 
Achitophel then presented his strategy to Absalom: "Let me select twelve thousand men for myself. I will set out this very night and pursue David."

(2 Samuel 17:2) 
"I will attack him while he is weary and exhausted. I will strike him down and scatter all the people who are with him. I will kill only the king."

(2 Samuel 17:3) 
"Then I will bring all of the people back to you, just as a bride returns to her husband. For you are seeking only the life of this one man, and afterward, all the rest of the people will be at peace."

(2 Samuel 17:4) 
This speech pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.

(2 Samuel 17:5) 
But Absalom said: "Also call Hushai the Archite, and let us hear what he too has to say."

(2 Samuel 17:6) 
When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him: "This is what Achitophel has proposed. Should we do what he has suggested, or do you advise against it?"

(2 Samuel 17:7) 
Hushai answered Absalom: "Achitophel’s counsel this time is not good."

(2 Samuel 17:8) 
Hushai added: "You know your father and the men with him, that they are mighty warriors and fiercely determined. They are like a bear robbed of her cubs in the wilderness. And your father is a man of war; he will not stay with the main army."

(2 Samuel 17:9) 
"Perhaps he is now hiding in some cave or in one of these secret places. And when he first strikes, everyone who hears of it will say, 'A great slaughter has fallen upon the people following Absalom!'"

(2 Samuel 17:10) 
"And even the bravest, strongest-hearted man will be filled with fear if he hears that those who are with David are broken. Moreover, all Israel knows that your father is a powerful warrior, and all who are with him are mighty."

(2 Samuel 17:11) 
"Instead, this is the counsel I give: Let all Israel gather to you, from Dan even to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand by the sea. And you yourself will lead them in the middle of them all."

(2 Samuel 17:12) 
"Then we will fall upon him wherever he may be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls upon the earth—so that not even one man who is with him will remain alive."

(2 Samuel 17:13) 
"If he has fled into some city, then all of Israel will surround that city. And we will drag it away with ropes until not even one small stone is found remaining there."

(2 Samuel 17:14) 
Absalom and all the men of Israel said: "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Achitophel." For the Lord had commanded that Achitophel's useful counsel be made void, so that the Lord might bring disaster upon Absalom.

(2 Samuel 17:15) 
Hushai then said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: "This is the counsel Achitophel gave to Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is the counsel I myself gave."

(2 Samuel 17:16) 
"Now therefore, quickly send word and tell David: 'Do not stay this night in the desert of the plain. But without delay, cross over the Jordan, lest perhaps the king and all the people with him be swallowed up.'"

(2 Samuel 17:17) 
Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by the Rogel Spring. A female servant went and told them the message. And they then set out to carry the message to King David, for they could not be seen entering the city.

(2 Samuel 17:18) 
However, a young man saw them and reported it to Absalom. But the messengers, hurrying quickly, rushed away and entered the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it to hide.

(2 Samuel 17:19) 
The woman then took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, as people usually do to dry grain, so that nothing at all was known of their hiding place.

(2 Samuel 17:20) 
When Absalom's servants came to the woman at her house, they asked: "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman answered them: "They hurried across the stream of water." And after they searched and did not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 17:21) 
When those pursuers had left, the two men came up out of the well. They went and informed King David, saying: "Get up, and quickly cross the river! For Achitophel has given this kind of counsel against you."

(2 Samuel 17:22) 
So David rose up, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan River before daybreak. Not even one person was left who had not crossed the river.

(2 Samuel 17:23) 
But Achitophel, seeing that his counsel had not been followed, saddled his donkey. He rose and went to his own house and to his own city. After he set his household in order, he hanged himself and died, and he was buried in his father’s tomb.

(2 Samuel 17:24) 
Meanwhile, David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom, however, crossed the Jordan River, and every man of Israel was with him.

(2 Samuel 17:25) 
Absalom then appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Amasa was the son of a man named Jethra the Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, who had been Joab's mother.

(2 Samuel 17:26) 
And Israel, with Absalom, camped in the land of Gilead.

(2 Samuel 17:27) 
When David came to Mahanaim, three men arrived to support him: Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.

(2 Samuel 17:28) 
They brought bedding and rugs and earthenware vessels. They also brought food supplies: wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, and lentils.

(2 Samuel 17:29) 
They also brought honey, butter, sheep, and cheese from cattle for David’s use and for the people who were with him. For they had supposed that the people might become hungry and exhausted in the desert.

(2 Samuel 17:1) 
Achitophel then spoke to Absalom: 'Let me choose twelve thousand men for myself, and I will rise up and pursue David this very night.'

(2 Samuel 17:2) 
'I will rush upon him while he is exhausted and weary, and I will strike him down. All the people who are with him will be scattered in terror, and I will strike the king alone.'

(2 Samuel 17:3) 
'I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. For it is only the life of one man that you seek, and then all the people will be at peace.'

(2 Samuel 17:4) 
This plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.

(2 Samuel 17:5) 
Absalom then said: 'Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he too has to say.'

(2 Samuel 17:6) 
When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said, speaking to him: 'Achitophel has spoken in this manner. Should we follow his advice or not? You advise us.'

(2 Samuel 17:7) 
And Hushai said to Absalom: 'The advice that Achitophel has given this time is not good.'

(2 Samuel 17:8) 
Hushai added: 'You know your father and the men who are with him, that they are very mighty and fierce in spirit, like a bear whose cubs have been taken from her in the wild. And your father is a warrior, and he will not spend the night with the people.'

(2 Samuel 17:9) 
'Perhaps right now he is hiding in some pit or in another secret place. And if even one of your men falls at the very beginning of the battle, the people will hear of it and say, 'There has been a great slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!''

(2 Samuel 17:10) 
'Then even the most courageous man, whose heart is like a lion, will be utterly terrified. For all of Israel knows that your father is a mighty warrior, and that all those who are with him are strong.'

(2 Samuel 17:11) 
'Instead, I advise this plan: Let all Israel gather to you, from Dan all the way to Beersheba, as countless as the sand of the sea. And you, personally, with your army, should go into battle at the head of them.'

(2 Samuel 17:12) 
'Then we will come upon him wherever he may be, and we will fall upon him as the dew falls upon the ground. And we will not leave even one of the men who are with him alive.'

(2 Samuel 17:13) 
'But if he has entered into some city, then all of Israel will surround that city, and we will drag all of its stones into the river, until not even one small stone can be found there.'

(2 Samuel 17:14) 
And it came to pass that Absalom and all the men of Israel said: 'The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Achitophel.' But it was by the will of the Lord that Achitophel's useful counsel was defeated, so that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.

(2 Samuel 17:15) 
Hushai then said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: 'Achitophel gave such and such counsel to Absalom and to the elders of Israel. And I gave such and such counsel.'

(2 Samuel 17:16) 
'Now therefore, quickly send a message and report to David, saying: 'Do not stay this night in the desert plains, but cross over quickly, lest perhaps the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.''

(2 Samuel 17:17) 
Jonathan and Ahimaaz were standing by the spring of Rogel. A servant girl would go and report to them, and they would then go and report to King David. For they could not be seen entering the city.

(2 Samuel 17:18) 
However, a certain young man saw them and reported it to Absalom. But Jonathan and Ahimaaz hurried and entered the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it.

(2 Samuel 17:19) 
And the woman took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, as if she were drying grain on it. And in this way the message was hidden.

(2 Samuel 17:20) 
When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said: 'Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' And the woman replied: 'They have crossed the stream of water.' And when they had searched and found them nowhere, they returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 17:21) 
After their departure, Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well and went and reported to King David, and they said: 'Rise up and cross the waters quickly! For Achitophel has begun to devise such and such counsel against you.'

(2 Samuel 17:22) 
So David arose, and all the people who were with him. And they crossed the Jordan River until dawn. Not even one person remained who had not crossed the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 17:23) 
Now Achitophel, seeing that his counsel had not been followed, saddled his donkey and arose, and went to his house and to his city. And he hanged himself, and so he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.

(2 Samuel 17:24) 
But David came to Mahanaim. Furthermore, Absalom crossed the Jordan River, and all the men of Israel were with him.

(2 Samuel 17:25) 
Absalom indeed appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, from Israel, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, who was Joab's mother.

(2 Samuel 17:26) 
And Israel, with Absalom, encamped in the land of Gilead.

(2 Samuel 17:27) 
When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, from Rogelim,

(2 Samuel 17:28) 
brought him mattresses, and blankets, and earthenware vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils,

(2 Samuel 17:29) 
And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cows from the herd. They gave these to David and to the people who were with him, so that they might eat. For they suspected that the people would be hungry, exhausted, and thirsty, having come into the wilderness.

(2 Samuel 18:1) 
David then reviewed his army and appointed commanders and officers over them.

(2 Samuel 18:2) 
David sent one third of the army under the command of Joab. Another third he sent under the command of Abishai, Joab's brother and son of Zeruiah. And the last third he sent under the command of Ittai the Gittite. David said to the whole army, "I will also march out with you."

(2 Samuel 18:3) 
But the army replied, "You must not go out with us! For if we have to flee, the enemy will not care about us. And if half of us fall in battle, they will not care. But you, our king, are like ten thousand of us! It is better for you to stay in the city and help us from there."

(2 Samuel 18:4) 
The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you, this I will do." So the king stood by the city gate. And the entire army marched out in groups of hundreds and thousands.

(2 Samuel 18:5) 
The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently, for my sake, with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard the king give this order about Absalom to all the commanders.

(2 Samuel 18:6) 
So the army went out into the open field against the army of Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.

(2 Samuel 18:7) 
There, the army of Israel was defeated by David's soldiers. A great slaughter happened that day, with twenty thousand men killed.

(2 Samuel 18:8) 
The battle spread across the entire region, and the dense forest killed more people than the sword.

(2 Samuel 18:9) 
Absalom happened to encounter David's men. Absalom was riding a mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak tree, Absalom's head got caught in the oak. He was left hanging between the sky and the earth, while the mule he was riding continued on its way.

(2 Samuel 18:10) 
A certain man saw this and reported it to Joab, saying, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."

(2 Samuel 18:11) 
Joab said to the man who reported it to him, "If you saw him, why didn't you strike him to the ground? I would have given you ten silver shekels and a military belt."

(2 Samuel 18:12) 
The man replied to Joab, "Even if you had weighed out a thousand silver shekels into my hand, I would not have laid a hand on the king's son. In our hearing, the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'Guard the young man Absalom, so that no one harms him.'"

(2 Samuel 18:13) 
"If I had done such a treacherous thing against his life, the king would surely have found out, and you yourself would have stood against me."

(2 Samuel 18:14) 
Joab said, "I will not wait like this. I will deal with him myself, right here in front of you." He took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while he was still struggling and alive.

(2 Samuel 18:15) 
Then ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom. They struck him and finished killing him.

(2 Samuel 18:16) 
Joab then blew the trumpet, signaling an end to the pursuit, and held back the army from chasing the fleeing Israelites. Joab wanted to spare the people.

(2 Samuel 18:17) 
They took Absalom and threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a very large heap of stones over him. Then all the remaining soldiers of Israel fled to their tents.

(2 Samuel 18:18) 
Now Absalom, during his lifetime, had erected a monument for himself in the King's Valley. He had said, "I have no son to keep my name alive." So he named the monument after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this very day.

(2 Samuel 18:19) 
Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, then said, "I will run and bring the news to the king that the Lord has avenged him against his enemies."

(2 Samuel 18:20) 
Joab said to him, "You are not the right messenger for this news today. You may deliver a message another day, but today do not carry news, because the king's son is dead."

(2 Samuel 18:21) 
Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off.

(2 Samuel 18:22) 
Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, still insisted and said to Joab, "But what if I run after the Cushite?" Joab replied, "Why do you want to run, my son? You will not be rewarded for this news."

(2 Samuel 18:23) 
"Regardless," he replied, "I will run!" So Joab said, "Go, run!" Ahimaaz then ran by way of the plain, which was a shortcut, and he overtook the Cushite.

(2 Samuel 18:24) 
Now David was sitting between the two gates of the city. A watchman was positioned on the roof of the gate's tower, and as he looked out, he saw a man running alone.

(2 Samuel 18:25) 
The watchman cried out and informed the king. The king said, "If he is alone, he brings good news." As the runner quickly approached,

(2 Samuel 18:26) 
The watchman saw another man running and called out to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man is running alone!" The king said, "He also brings good news."

(2 Samuel 18:27) 
The watchman said, "I recognize the running style of the first man; it is the stride of Ahimaaz, Zadok's son." The king said, "He is a good man, and he comes with good news."

(2 Samuel 18:28) 
Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king!"

(2 Samuel 18:29) 
The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz replied, "I saw a great commotion when Joab sent your servant, the king's servant, and me. But I do not know what it was about."

(2 Samuel 18:30) 
The king said, "Step aside and stand over here." So he stepped aside and stood.

(2 Samuel 18:31) 
Then, the Cushite arrived. The Cushite said, "Let my lord the king hear the news! For the Lord has avenged you today against all who rose up against you!"

(2 Samuel 18:32) 
The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you with evil intent, become like that young man."

(2 Samuel 18:33) 
The king was deeply distressed. He went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. As he walked, he kept saying, "My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!"

(2 Samuel 18:1) 
David then gathered all the men who were with him. He organized them into an army and appointed commanders over thousands of men and captains over hundreds.

(2 Samuel 18:2) 
David then divided his fighting men into three parts. One third was under the command of Joab. Another third was under the command of Abishai, Joab’s brother, the son of Zeruiah. The final third was under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king then spoke to the men, saying, 'I will also go out to fight with you, personally leading the charge.'

(2 Samuel 18:3) 
The men replied, 'No, you must not go with us. If we were forced to retreat, the enemy would not care much about us. And if half of us were to fall in battle, it would not be of great concern to them. This is because you, our King, are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, it is far better that you stay within the city and give us support from there.'

(2 Samuel 18:4) 
The king said to them, 'I will do whatever seems best to you.' So the king stood beside the gate of the city. All the men then marched out, organized by their hundreds and by their thousands, ready for battle.

(2 Samuel 18:5) 
The king then gave an order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He said, 'For my sake, deal gently with the young man Absalom.' All the fighting men heard the king giving this instruction to all his commanders concerning Absalom.

(2 Samuel 18:6) 
So the men of David went out into the field against the rebel army of Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.

(2 Samuel 18:7) 
There, the army of Israel was defeated by David’s servants. On that day, a great slaughter occurred, with twenty thousand men being killed.

(2 Samuel 18:8) 
The battle spread out across the entire face of the land. More men were killed by the forest itself—by its dangers and confusion—than were consumed by the sword in the fighting that day.

(2 Samuel 18:9) 
It happened that Absalom came upon David’s servants while riding a mule. The mule went under a large, low-hanging oak tree, and Absalom’s head became entangled in the branches of the oak. He was left suspended there between the sky and the ground, while the mule he had been riding continued on its way.

(2 Samuel 18:10) 
A certain man saw this occur and reported it to Joab, saying, 'I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.'

(2 Samuel 18:11) 
Joab replied, 'If you saw him, why didn’t you strike him down to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a military belt as a reward.'

(2 Samuel 18:12) 
The man answered Joab, 'Even if you were to weigh out a thousand shekels of silver into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king’s son. For we all heard the king give you, Abishai, and Ittai this command: ‘Be careful that no one harms the young man Absalom.’'

(2 Samuel 18:13) 
Truly, I would not risk my own life by daring to disregard your orders—and the king would surely find out about this. In that case, you yourself would stand against me for disobeying the king.

(2 Samuel 18:14) 
Joab then said, 'That is not how this will end. I will act in your presence!' He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive and hanging in the oak tree.

(2 Samuel 18:15) 
Then ten young men, who were Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom. They struck him again and killed him, ensuring his death.

(2 Samuel 18:16) 
Joab then blew the trumpet, signaling an end to the pursuit. He stopped the men from chasing the fleeing Israelites, for Joab wanted to spare the people of Israel from further slaughter.

(2 Samuel 18:17) 
Then David’s men took Absalom and threw his body into a large pit in the forest. They piled a very great heap of stones over him, marking his dishonorable grave. Meanwhile, all the remaining men of Israel who had fought for Absalom fled to their homes and tents.

(2 Samuel 18:18) 
Now, while Absalom was still alive, he had erected a pillar for himself in the King’s Valley. He had said, 'I have no son to keep my name alive, so this pillar will be a monument to my name.' He named the pillar after himself, and it is called to this very day, 'Absalom’s Monument.'

(2 Samuel 18:19) 
Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, 'I will run now and bring news to the king—that the Lord has given him victory over his enemies.'

(2 Samuel 18:20) 
But Joab said to him, 'You will not be the messenger today. You may be a messenger on another day, but I do not want you to be the messenger today, because the king’s son is dead, and the news will bring him great sorrow.'

(2 Samuel 18:21) 
Joab then said to a Cushite man, 'Go, tell the king what you have seen.' The Cushite bowed to Joab and quickly ran off.

(2 Samuel 18:22) 
Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, again urged Joab, saying, 'What prevents me from running after the Cushite man as well?' Joab replied, 'Why would you run, my son? You will not be bringing good news.'

(2 Samuel 18:23) 
Ahimaaz answered, 'Even so, what if I simply run?' And Joab said to him, 'Then run!' So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite man.

(2 Samuel 18:24) 
Now David was sitting between the two inner and outer gates of the city. A lookout man had gone up to the roof of the gate by the wall. When he lifted his eyes and saw a man running alone toward them,

(2 Samuel 18:25) 
he called out and informed the king. The king said, 'If he is alone, then he is bringing good news.' As the man hurried and came closer,

(2 Samuel 18:26) 
the lookout saw another man running. The first lookout called out to the king, saying, 'Look, another man is running alone!' The king replied, 'He, too, is bringing good news.'

(2 Samuel 18:27) 
The lookout then said, 'I recognize the running style of the first man; it is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok.' The king said, 'He is a good man, and he comes bringing good tidings.'

(2 Samuel 18:28) 
Ahimaaz then called out and said to the king, 'All is well, O king!' He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, 'Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king!'

(2 Samuel 18:29) 
The king asked, 'Is the young man Absalom safe?' Ahimaaz answered, 'I saw a great commotion when Joab, your servant, was sending me, your humble servant. I do not know what else happened beyond that.'

(2 Samuel 18:30) 
The king said, 'Stand aside here.' So Ahimaaz stepped aside and stood still.

(2 Samuel 18:31) 
And behold, the Cushite man arrived. He said, 'Let my lord the king hear the news! For the Lord has today granted you justice by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you!'

(2 Samuel 18:32) 
The king asked the Cushite man, 'Is the young man Absalom safe?' The Cushite answered, 'May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you with evil intent, be as that young man is now.'

(2 Samuel 18:33) 
The king was deeply shaken and distressed. He went up to the room above the gate and wept. As he walked, he spoke, saying, 'My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!'

(2 Samuel 19:1) 
It was reported to Joab that the king was weeping, and openly mourning over Absalom.

(2 Samuel 19:2) 
And so, all the joy of the people on that day turned into deep mourning, for everyone heard that the king was heartbroken over his son.

(2 Samuel 19:3) 
The people were unsettled; they entered the city in silence on that day. They were as disquieted as an army that has been defeated, and then flees in shame and confusion.

(2 Samuel 19:4) 
The king kept crying out in a loud voice: “My son Absalom, Absalom my son, my son!”

(2 Samuel 19:5) 
So Joab entered the king’s house, and said to him: “Today, you have made all of your servants ashamed. These are the men who, on this very day, saved your life, and the lives of your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your concubines.

(2 Samuel 19:6) 
You love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. You have shown today that you have no concern for your commanders or for your servants. I truly know this day that if Absalom were alive, and all of us had died, then it would please you.

(2 Samuel 19:7) 
Now get up, go out, and speak words of comfort to your servants. For I swear to you by the Lord, if you do not go out, not even one man will remain with you tonight. And this will be worse for you than all the evils that have befallen you from your youth until this present day.”

(2 Samuel 19:8) 
So the king rose up, and he sat at the city gate. And it was announced to all the people that the king was sitting at the gate. Then all the people came before the king.

(2 Samuel 19:9) 
Meanwhile, the army of Israel had fled, each man to his own tent, their homes.

(2 Samuel 19:10) 
And all the people were contending in all the tribes of Israel, saying: “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He himself rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. And now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.

(2 Samuel 19:11) 
But Absalom, whom we anointed over us as king, is dead in battle. Now then, why are you silent? Why are you not bringing the king back?”

(2 Samuel 19:12) 
But King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, saying: “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying: ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house?

(2 Samuel 19:13) 
You are my brothers, my very own flesh and blood. Why should you be the last to bring the king back?

(2 Samuel 19:14) 
And to Amasa you shall say: ‘Are you not my very own flesh and blood? May God do such to me, and add more to it, if you are not the commander of my army for all days in place of Joab.’ ”

(2 Samuel 19:15) 
And David swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as if they were one man. So they sent word to the king, saying: “Return, you and all your servants.”

(2 Samuel 19:16) 
So the king returned, and came as far as the Jordan River. And Judah had come to Gilgal to meet the king, so that they might escort him across the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 19:17) 
Then Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.

(2 Samuel 19:18) 
There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him. Also, Ziba, the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons, and his twenty servants were with him. And they rushed into the Jordan ahead of the king.

(2 Samuel 19:19) 
They crossed the river by ferry boat to carry over the king’s household and to do whatever he commanded. Shimei also, the son of Gera, prostrated himself before the king when he had just crossed the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 19:20) 
He said to the king: “My lord, do not hold my iniquity against me. Let what your servant did perversely on the day my Lord the King departed from Jerusalem not be remembered. Do not take it to heart, O King.

(2 Samuel 19:21) 
For your servant knows that I have sinned. And because of this, behold, I am the first of all the house of Joseph —meaning the northern tribes of Israel— to come down and meet you, my Lord the King.”

(2 Samuel 19:22) 
But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said: “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord’s anointed king?”

(2 Samuel 19:23) 
And David said: “What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? Why do you oppose me today? Shall any man be put to death in Israel today? Do you not know that today I have been established as king over Israel?”

(2 Samuel 19:24) 
And the king said to Shimei: “You shall not die.” And the king swore an oath to him.

(2 Samuel 19:25) 
Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, also came down to meet the king. He had not washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes from the day the king had departed in flight until the day he returned in peace.

(2 Samuel 19:26) 
When he had greeted the king, the king said to him: “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?”

(2 Samuel 19:27) 
And he answered, saying: “My Lord the king, my servant Ziba deceived me. For I said to him, ‘Saddle an ass for me, so I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for I am lame.

(2 Samuel 19:28) 
And he —Ziba— has falsely slandered me to you, my lord the king. But you, my lord the king, are like an angel of God. Do what pleases you.

(2 Samuel 19:29) 
For indeed, the house of my father —Saul's house— was deserving of nothing but death from my lord the king. Yet you placed your servant among those who eat at your own table. So what just reason do I have to still complain to the king?”

(2 Samuel 19:30) 
And the king said: “Why do you speak further? I have said: you and Ziba shall divide the land possessions.”

(2 Samuel 19:31) 
Then Mephibosheth said to the king: “Indeed, let him —Ziba— take everything, now that my Lord the King has returned to his house in peace.”

(2 Samuel 19:32) 
Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim, and he crossed the Jordan with the king to escort him and provide for him on his journey.

(2 Samuel 19:33) 
Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. And he had provided sustenance for the king while he stayed at Mahanaim. For he was a very wealthy man.

(2 Samuel 19:34) 
So the king said to Barzillai: “Come with me, so that you may be cared for by me in Jerusalem.”

(2 Samuel 19:35) 
And Barzillai answered the king: “How many days are there in the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?

(2 Samuel 19:36) 
I am eighty years old today. Can I still discern what is good or bad? Can your servant still delight in food or drink? Can I still hear the voice of male or female singers? Why should your servant be a burden to my Lord the King?

(2 Samuel 19:37) 
Let your servant just escort the king across the Jordan. Do not repay me with this kindness that I cannot fully appreciate.

(2 Samuel 19:38) 
But let your servant return, and I will die in my own city, and be buried beside the tomb of my father and my mother. However, your servant Chimham is here. Let him go with you, my Lord the King, and do for him whatever pleases you.”

(2 Samuel 19:39) 
And the king said: “Let Chimham go with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you request of me, you shall obtain.”

(2 Samuel 19:40) 
Then all the people crossed the Jordan, and the king was in their midst. And when the king returned, he came to Gilgal, and Chimham with him. All the people of Judah had escorted the king, and half of the people of Israel.

(2 Samuel 19:1) 
And it was reported to Joab that the king was weeping and mourning over Absalom.

(2 Samuel 19:2) 
And all the joy of the people turned into mourning on that day, because the people heard that the king was grieving deeply over his son.

(2 Samuel 19:3) 
And the people entered the city in a stealthy manner on that day, just as a people who are ashamed and have fled from battle are accustomed to enter secretly.

(2 Samuel 19:4) 
But the king was crying out, with his face covered, and with a loud voice, saying: "My son Absalom, my son Absalom! Oh, that I had died for you, my son Absalom!"

(2 Samuel 19:5) 
So Joab came to the king in his house and said: "Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants who have fought today for your life, and for the lives of your sons and your daughters, and for the lives of your wives, and for the lives of your concubines."

(2 Samuel 19:6) 
"You love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. And you have shown today that you care nothing for your commanders and your servants. Indeed, I know now that if Absalom were alive, and all of us had died today, then that would have pleased you."

(2 Samuel 19:7) 
"So now, get up and go out, and speak words of comfort to your servants. For I swear to you by the Lord, that if you do not go out, not even one man will remain with you this night. And this will be worse for you than all the evils that have happened to you from your youth until now."

(2 Samuel 19:8) 
So the king got up and sat in the city gate. And it was announced to all the people that the king was sitting in the gate. Then all the multitude came before the king.

(2 Samuel 19:9) 
Meanwhile, all of Israel had fled to their tents.

(2 Samuel 19:10) 
And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he himself rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. And now he had been forced to flee from the land because of Absalom."

(2 Samuel 19:11) 
"But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now then, why do you not take steps to bring the king back?"

(2 Samuel 19:12) 
Now King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, saying: "Speak to the elders of Judah, saying: 'Why are you the very last to bring the king back to his house?'" For the words of all Israel had reached the king in his house.

(2 Samuel 19:13) 
"And say to Amasa: 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of my army before me at all times instead of Joab.'"

(2 Samuel 19:14) 
And he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man. So they sent word to the king, saying: "Return, you and all your servants."

(2 Samuel 19:15) 
So the king returned and came as far as the Jordan River. And Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king, to escort him across the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 19:16) 
But Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.

(2 Samuel 19:17) 
And a thousand men of Benjamin were with him. Also Ziba, the servant of Saul's house, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, were with him. And they rushed into the Jordan, going ahead of the king.

(2 Samuel 19:18) 
And they crossed the ford to help the king's household cross over and to do whatever he commanded. And Shimei himself prostrated himself before the king, after the king had already crossed the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 19:19) 
He said to the king: "Do not count against me, my lord, this iniquity, nor remember what I did wickedly on the day when you departed from Jerusalem, my lord the king. Let your heart not bear a grudge, O king."

(2 Samuel 19:20) 
"For I, your servant, confess my sin. And behold, for this reason, I am the first of all the house of Joseph — meaning the northern tribes of Israel — who has come down today to meet my lord the king."

(2 Samuel 19:21) 
But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said: "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?"

(2 Samuel 19:22) 
And David said: "What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know today that I am established as king over Israel?"

(2 Samuel 19:23) 
And the king said to Shimei: "You shall not die." And the king swore an oath to him.

(2 Samuel 19:24) 
Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, also came down to meet the king. And he was in mourning, with unwashed feet and an untrimmed beard, from the day the king had departed until the day of his peaceful return.

(2 Samuel 19:25) 
When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him: "Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?"

(2 Samuel 19:26) 
He answered and said: "My lord the king, my servant Ziba despised me. For I said to him that he should saddle a donkey for me, so that I might ride upon it and go with the king, because your servant is lame."

(2 Samuel 19:27) 
"And he himself, your servant Ziba, has slandered me to you, my lord the king. But you, O king, are like an angel of God; do what is pleasing to you."

(2 Samuel 19:28) 
"For there was nothing from all my father's house but that which was worthy of death before you. Yet you placed your servant among those who eat at your table. What then do I have to complain about justly? Or what more can I cry out to the king?"

(2 Samuel 19:29) 
And the king said to him: "Why do you speak further? I have decided: You and Ziba divide the land."

(2 Samuel 19:30) 
And Mephibosheth answered the king: "Let him even take everything, since my lord the king has returned to his house in peace."

(2 Samuel 19:31) 
Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim and accompanied the king across the Jordan, to go with him beyond the Jordan.

(2 Samuel 19:32) 
Now Barzillai was very old, that is, eighty years old. And he himself had provided for the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.

(2 Samuel 19:33) 
And the king said to Barzillai: "Come with me, that you may rest with me in Jerusalem."

(2 Samuel 19:34) 
And Barzillai said to the king: "How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"

(2 Samuel 19:35) 
"I am eighty years old today. Can I still discern good from bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voice of male and female singers? Why should your servant be a burden to you in all these things?"

(2 Samuel 19:36) 
"Your servant will only tarry a little while across the Jordan. I beg you, let me return and die in my own city, and be buried near the tomb of my father and my mother. Behold, your servant Chimham is here; let him go with you, my lord the king, and do for him whatever pleases you."

(2 Samuel 19:37) 
And the king said: "Let Chimham go with you, and I will do for him whatever pleases you, and everything you ask of me, you shall obtain."

(2 Samuel 19:38) 
When all the people had crossed the Jordan, and the king also crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him. And Barzillai returned to his own place.

(2 Samuel 19:39) 
So the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham with him. All the people of Judah had escorted the king, and half the people of Israel as well.

(2 Samuel 19:40) 
And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, saying to the king: "Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, and his household, and all the men of David with him, across the river?"

(2 Samuel 20:1) 
And behold, there was a lawless man there, named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. This man blew a trumpet, and cried out, saying: "We have no portion with David, nor do we have any inheritance in the son of Jesse—that is, in David's lineage! Every man, return now to your own homes, O Israel!"

(2 Samuel 20:2) 
So all the other tribes of Israel withdrew their loyalty from David and followed Sheba, the son of Bichri. However, the men of Judah remained completely loyal to their king, from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 20:3) 
When King David arrived at his house in Jerusalem, he took his ten concubine women whom he had left behind to watch over the palace during his flight. Because they had been defiled by Absalom, David placed them in a secluded house, like women in widowhood. He provided them with food and everything they needed, but he never had relations with them again. They remained shut away in this condition until the day they died, living as if they were true widows.

(2 Samuel 20:4) 
Then King David said to Amasa: "Summon all the men of Judah to assemble for me within three days, and make sure that you yourself are present."

(2 Samuel 20:5) 
So Amasa went out to summon Judah, but he delayed much longer than the time the king had set for him to return.

(2 Samuel 20:6) 
Therefore, David said to Abishai: "Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more harm than Absalom ever did. Take therefore your master's servants—that is, my personal guard—and pursue him, lest he seize fortified cities and escape from us."

(2 Samuel 20:7) 
So Joab's men went out with Abishai, along with the Cherethites, and the Pelethites—that is, David's elite guard—and all the strong warriors. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, the son of Bichri.

(2 Samuel 20:8) 
As they were near the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was girded with his military tunic over his usual garment, and around his waist was a tightly fastened belt with a dagger sheathed in it. As he went forward, the dagger immediately fell out of its sheath and to the lower part of his body—unbeknownst to Amasa, this was a deliberate maneuver.

(2 Samuel 20:9) 
And Joab said to Amasa: "Greetings, my brother!" Then with his right hand, Joab took hold of Amasa's beard, as if to kiss him.

(2 Samuel 20:10) 
But Amasa did not notice the sword that Joab held in his left hand. With it, Joab struck him in the side, spilling his intestines out onto the ground. He did not need a second wound; Amasa died immediately. After this, Joab and Abishai, his brother, continued their pursuit of Sheba, the son of Bichri.

(2 Samuel 20:11) 
And one of Joab's servants, standing by Amasa's body, cried out: "Whoever is for Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!"

(2 Samuel 20:12) 
Now Amasa was writhing in his own blood in the middle of the road. That man saw that all the people were stopping because of the sight. So he dragged Amasa off the road into a field and covered him with a garment, so that passersby would not stop and hinder the pursuit because of him.

(2 Samuel 20:13) 
Once Amasa was removed from the road, all the men who were following Joab continued their march to pursue Sheba, the son of Bichri.

(2 Samuel 20:14) 
Sheba, however, passed through all the tribes of Israel, going to Abel of Beth-Maachah, and through all the communities of the Berites. There, all the people gathered and followed him.

(2 Samuel 20:15) 
So Joab arrived and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-Maachah. They built a siege ramp and a trench around the city. Then all the troops who were with Joab took their positions and began to undermine the city walls.

(2 Samuel 20:16) 
Then a wise woman from the city called out: "Listen! Listen! Speak to Joab! Tell him to come closer, so I may speak with him."

(2 Samuel 20:17) 
When Joab approached, she asked: "Are you Joab?" He answered: "I am." And she said: "Hear the words of your handmaid." He replied: "I am listening."

(2 Samuel 20:18) 
Then she spoke: "There is an old saying, and it is spoken: 'Whoever inquires in Abel, that is how the matter is resolved.'"

(2 Samuel 20:19) 
She continued: "I am among those who seek counsel and pursue peace in Israel. Yet you are trying to overthrow a city, and to destroy a mother in Israel—a principal city. Why would you devastate the inheritance of the Lord?"

(2 Samuel 20:20) 
And Joab answered, saying: "Far be it, far be it from me! This will never happen!"

(2 Samuel 20:21) 
He continued: "That is not the case at all! Rather, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba, the son of Bichri, has raised his hand in rebellion against King David. Just hand him over, and we will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab: "Behold, his head will be thrown over the wall to you."

(2 Samuel 20:22) 
So the woman went to all the people and spoke to them with wisdom. Then they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and threw it over the wall to Joab. Joab then blew the trumpet, and all the men dispersed from the city, each returning to his own home. Joab, for his part, returned to Jerusalem to the king.

(2 Samuel 20:23) 
Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel. Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in command over the Cherethites and the Pelethites—David's personal bodyguards.

(2 Samuel 20:24) 
Adoram was in charge of collecting tribute. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder of official records.

(2 Samuel 20:25) 
Sheva was the secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.

(2 Samuel 20:26) 
And Ira, the Jairite, was also a priest alongside David, serving as his personal chaplain.

(2 Samuel 20:1) 
It happened then that a wicked man named Sheba, son of Bochri, from the tribe of Benjamin, found a trumpet and blew it, declaring to the people: "We have no portion in David! We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse (meaning King David)! Everyone to your tents, O Israel!" So all the people of Israel turned away from David and followed Sheba, son of Bochri. But the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, accompanying him from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem.

(2 Samuel 20:2) 
When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines whom he had left behind to guard the household. He placed them under house arrest, providing for their sustenance, but he no longer had marital relations with them. They remained confined, living as widows until the day they died.

(2 Samuel 20:3) 
Indeed, when the king arrived at his house in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubine women whom he had sent away to guard the house. He confined them to a house, placing them under guard, and provided them with food. He did not go in to them, and they remained locked away, living like widows until their death.

(2 Samuel 20:4) 
Then the king said to Amasa: "Call the men of Judah for me to gather by the third day, and you must be present there yourself."

(2 Samuel 20:5) 
So Amasa went to summon the men of Judah, but he delayed beyond the appointed time that the king had set for him.

(2 Samuel 20:6) 
And David said to Abishai: "Now Sheba, son of Bochri, will do us more harm than Absalom did. Therefore, take your master's soldiers and pursue him, lest he find fortified cities and escape from us."

(2 Samuel 20:7) 
So Joab's men went out after Abishai, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, son of Bochri.

(2 Samuel 20:8) 
When they were near the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military uniform, and over it, a sword was belted to his waist, sheathed at his side. As he stepped forward, the sword slipped out of its sheath and fell.

(2 Samuel 20:9) 
And Joab said to Amasa: "Greetings, my brother!" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand, as if to kiss him.

(2 Samuel 20:10) 
But Amasa did not pay attention to the sword that Joab held in his left hand. Joab then stabbed him in the side, piercing his groin, and spilled his intestines onto the ground. He did not need to strike a second blow, and Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued their pursuit of Sheba, son of Bochri.

(2 Samuel 20:11) 
Meanwhile, one of Joab's young men (soldiers) stood by Amasa's body and said: "Let anyone who is for Joab, and who is for David, follow us!"

(2 Samuel 20:12) 
Now Amasa lay writhing in his blood in the middle of the road. That soldier saw that all the people who were passing by were stopping to look. So he dragged Amasa from the road into a field and covered him with a garment, so that the sight of him would not delay the people who were passing by.

(2 Samuel 20:13) 
Therefore, once Amasa's body was removed from the road, all the men continued on to pursue Sheba, son of Bochri, with Joab and all who were with him.

(2 Samuel 20:14) 
Sheba then traveled through all the tribes of Israel and came to Abel of Beth Maachah and all the Berites. There, many people gathered and followed him.

(2 Samuel 20:15) 
Joab's forces came and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth Maachah. They surrounded the city, and against its walls, they built a siege ramp. All the multitude that was with Joab began undermining the wall, attempting to cause it to collapse.

(2 Samuel 20:16) 
Then a wise woman cried out from the city: "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab: Come near here, and I will speak with you."

(2 Samuel 20:17) 
When Joab approached her, the woman asked: "Are you Joab?" And he answered: "I am." She said to him: "Hear the words of your servant." And he replied: "I hear."

(2 Samuel 20:18) 
And she said: "There is an old saying among the people who would declare: 'When they seek counsel in Abel, they bring matters to completion.'" (This proverb highlights Abel's reputation as a place of wisdom and resolution.)

(2 Samuel 20:19) 
I am one of those who seek peace and receive a peaceful answer in Israel. So why do you want to destroy a city that is one of the chief cities in Israel? And why do you seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord (meaning God's people)?

(2 Samuel 20:20) 
And Joab answered, saying: "Far be it from me, far be it from me, that I should destroy or demolish anything!"

(2 Samuel 20:21) 
That is not the case. Instead, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba, son of Bochri, has raised his hand against King David. Hand over him alone, and we will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab: "Behold, his head will be thrown over the wall to you."

(2 Samuel 20:22) 
So the woman went to all the people and spoke to them wisely. And they cut off the head of Sheba, son of Bochri, and threw it to Joab. He immediately blew the trumpet, signaling the end of the siege, and they withdrew from the city, each man returning to his own tents. Joab then returned to Jerusalem to the king.

(2 Samuel 20:23) 
Therefore, Joab remained commander over all the army of Israel. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites (David's elite bodyguard and executioners).

(2 Samuel 20:24) 
Adoram was in charge of the tribute (overseeing forced labor and taxes). Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder (the royal chronicler or secretary of state).

(2 Samuel 20:25) 
Sheva was the scribe (the secretary who managed royal correspondence and records). And Zadok and Abiathar were the priests (the two high priests serving David).

(2 Samuel 20:26) 
Moreover, Ira the Jairite was also a priest for David (likely a personal or honorary priestly advisor to the king).

(2 Samuel 21:1) 
And a famine came upon the land during the reign of King David, and this famine lasted for three continuous years. King David sought to know the reason, so he consulted the oracle of the Lord for divine instruction. And the Lord revealed: 'This famine is because of Saul, and because of his entire house, which is guilty of shedding innocent blood — a bloodguilt incurred when Saul, in his zeal, massacred the Gibeonites.'

(2 Samuel 21:2) 
So King David called the Gibeonites to him and spoke with them. (Now, the Gibeonites were not from the Israelite people, but were a remnant of the Amorites. The sons of Israel had sworn an oath to them long ago, but Saul, in his misguided zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah, had sought to kill them all.)

(2 Samuel 21:3) 
Then David said to the Gibeonites: 'What must I do for you? And what atonement can be made, so that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord — meaning, the people and land of Israel?'

(2 Samuel 21:4) 
And the Gibeonites answered him: 'It is not a matter of silver or gold for us concerning Saul or his house. Nor do we desire that any specific man of Israel be put to death by our hand.' But they had something else in mind. And David said to them: 'Whatever you ask for, I will do it for you.'

(2 Samuel 21:5) 
They responded to the king: 'Concerning the man who crushed us, who utterly destroyed us, and who planned for us to be completely annihilated — so that we would no longer exist within any of the borders of Israel—'

(2 Samuel 21:6) 
'Let seven men from his sons be given to us. We will then impale them before the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, the very place where Saul, the Lord's chosen king, once lived.' And the king said: 'I will give them to you.'

(2 Samuel 21:7) 
However, the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, who was Saul's son. He did this because of the solemn oath made before the Lord that had existed between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.

(2 Samuel 21:8) 
So King David took two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul: Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.

(2 Samuel 21:9) 
And David gave these seven men into the hand of the Gibeonites. They impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. And these seven fell together — they died on the very first days of the harvest, right as the people were beginning to cut the wheat.

(2 Samuel 21:10) 
But Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it for herself on a rock from the beginning of the harvest season. She stayed there, watching over the bodies, until rain poured down upon them from the sky — signifying God's acceptance of the atonement. During all this time, she did not allow the birds of the sky to rest upon the bodies by day, nor the wild animals of the field to approach them by night.

(2 Samuel 21:11) 
And it was reported to King David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done in her faithfulness.

(2 Samuel 21:12) 
Then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead. These men had secretly taken them from the public square of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they killed Saul on Mount Gilboa.

(2 Samuel 21:13) 
And from there, David brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan. He also gathered the bones of those men who had been impaled.

(2 Samuel 21:14) 
And they buried them — meaning, all the bones — with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin, in Zela, in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. They carried out everything the king had commanded. After these things were done, God was appeased concerning the land, and the famine ended.

(2 Samuel 21:15) 
Now, it happened again that there was a battle of the Philistines against Israel. David went down, and his servants went with him, and they fought against the Philistines. And during the fighting, David grew weary and exhausted.

(2 Samuel 21:16) 
Then Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the descendants of the giant Rapha, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze — equivalent to a heavy amount of gold — and who was armed with a new sword, tried to kill King David.

(2 Samuel 21:17) 
But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to David's rescue. He struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore an oath to him, saying: 'You shall not go out with us into battle anymore, lest you extinguish the lamp of Israel' — meaning, the very light and hope of our nation.

(2 Samuel 21:18) 
After this, another battle occurred in Gob against the Philistines. At that time, Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was also one of the descendants of the giant Rapha.

(2 Samuel 21:19) 
And again, battle was fought in Gob against the Philistines. In this engagement, Elhanan, the craftsman — whose proper name `Adeodatus faber` means 'God-given artisan' — struck down the Gittite giant, who was surnamed Goliath, and whose spear shaft was so massive it resembled a weaver's beam.

(2 Samuel 21:20) 
There was also another battle in Gath, in which there was a man of great stature. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — that is, twenty-four digits in total. And he was also one of the descendants of the giant Rapha.

(2 Samuel 21:21) 
And he — this giant — blasphemed Israel, challenging them. And Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.

(2 Samuel 21:22) 
These four — meaning these four giants from the lineage of Rapha who lived in Gath — all fell by the hand of King David and his servants.

(2 Samuel 21:1) 
During David's reign, a famine that lasted continuously for three years occurred. So David inquired of the Lord, seeking His divine answer. The Lord then said: "This famine is because of Saul and his household's bloodguilt, and because he killed the Gibeonites."

(2 Samuel 21:2) 
The king then summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (The Gibeonites, by the way, were not descendants of Israel but were among the remaining Amorites. The sons of Israel had once sworn an oath to them, but Saul, in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah, had attempted to wipe them out.)

(2 Samuel 21:3) 
David then asked the Gibeonites: "What do you want me to do for you? What atonement can I make so that you may bless the Lord's inheritance—His people and His land—and the famine will end?"

(2 Samuel 21:4) 
The Gibeonites answered him: "Our claim against Saul and his house is not about silver or gold. Nor do we desire that any ordinary Israelite be put to death." David then pressed them again: "What then *do* you want me to do for you?"

(2 Samuel 21:5) 
They answered the king: "Concerning the man who crushed us and cruelly persecuted us with the intent to wipe us out completely from all the borders of Israel—"

(2 Samuel 21:6) 
"—let seven men of his descendants be given to us, so that they may be impaled before the Lord in Gibeon, Saul's city, who was once the Lord's chosen king." The king replied: "I will give them."

(2 Samuel 21:7) 
However, the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan (Saul's son), because of the sacred oath sworn before the Lord between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.

(2 Samuel 21:8) 
So the king took the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, whom Saul had fathered: Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, Saul's daughter, whom Hadriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite, had fathered.

(2 Samuel 21:9) 
And he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, who then impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. These seven died together during the first days of the harvest, right at the beginning of the barley harvest.

(2 Samuel 21:10) 
Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, also took sackcloth for herself and spread it out upon a rock, making a vigil. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until the rains finally poured down on the bodies from the sky. During that entire time, she did not allow the birds of the sky to settle on them by day, nor the wild beasts of the field to approach them by night.

(2 Samuel 21:11) 
And it was reported to David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done.

(2 Samuel 21:12) 
David then went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead. These men had previously rescued the bodies, stealing them from the public square of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines had displayed them after killing Saul on Mount Gilboa.

(2 Samuel 21:13) 
From there, David brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan. He also gathered the bones of those who had been impaled by the Gibeonites.

(2 Samuel 21:14) 
And they buried them (the bones of the seven impaled men) along with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan, in the land of Benjamin, in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. They carried out everything the king had commanded. After these acts, God was finally appeased for the land of Israel.

(2 Samuel 22:1) 
David spoke this song to the Lord, on the very day the Lord had rescued him from the power of all his enemies, and from the power of Saul.

(2 Samuel 22:2) 
And David said: “The Lord is my strength and my fortified place, my refuge and my savior.

(2 Samuel 22:3) 
My God is my Rock, in Him I will trust. He is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my sanctuary. My Savior, you will deliver me from injustice.

(2 Samuel 22:4) 
When I call upon the Lord with praise, I will be saved from my enemies.

(2 Samuel 22:5) 
For the waves of death had surrounded me; the destructive currents of iniquity terrified me.

(2 Samuel 22:6) 
The snares of hell encircled me; the traps of death had seized me.

(2 Samuel 22:7) 
In my distress, I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God. And from His holy temple, He heard my voice, and my cry came to His ears.

(2 Samuel 22:8) 
Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were stirred, and they were made low, because the Lord was angry with them.

(2 Samuel 22:9) 
Smoke rose from His nostrils, and fire from His mouth devoured; burning coals were ignited by Him.

(2 Samuel 22:10) 
He bowed the sky and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet.

(2 Samuel 22:11) 
And He rode upon a Cherub and flew; He glided upon the wings of the winds.

(2 Samuel 22:12) 
He made darkness His hidden place all around Him, His tent was all around Him: dark water and thick clouds of the sky.

(2 Samuel 22:13) 
From the brilliance before Him, coals of fire were kindled.

(2 Samuel 22:14) 
The Lord thundered from the sky, and the Most High gave forth His voice.

(2 Samuel 22:15) 
He sent forth arrows and scattered them; He sent lightning and put them to flight.

(2 Samuel 22:16) 
Then the ocean floor became visible, and the foundations of the earth were uncovered at the Lord's rebuke, at the blast of the breath of His fury.

(2 Samuel 22:17) 
He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of many waters.

(2 Samuel 22:18) 
He rescued me from my mighty enemies, and from those who hated me, because they were too strong for me.

(2 Samuel 22:19) 
They confronted me on the day of my distress, but the Lord became my protector.

(2 Samuel 22:20) 
And He brought me out into a wide-open place; He delivered me because I was pleasing to Him.

(2 Samuel 22:21) 
The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands, He will repay me.

(2 Samuel 22:22) 
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not acted wickedly against my God.

(2 Samuel 22:23) 
For all His judgments are before my eyes, and I have not turned His commands away from me.

(2 Samuel 22:24) 
I will be blameless before Him, and I will keep myself from my iniquity.

(2 Samuel 22:25) 
Therefore the Lord will repay me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of His eyes.

(2 Samuel 22:26) 
With the holy, You will be holy; and with the mighty, You will be perfect.

(2 Samuel 22:27) 
With the chosen, You will be chosen; and with the perverse, You will be perverse.

(2 Samuel 22:28) 
And You will save the humble people, but You will humble the eyes of the proud.

(2 Samuel 22:29) 
For You, O Lord, are my lamp; and You, O Lord, will illuminate my darkness.

(2 Samuel 22:30) 
For by Your help, I will charge into battle prepared, and by the power of my God, I will leap over any wall.

(2 Samuel 22:31) 
God makes my way perfect; the word of the Lord is proven by fire; He is a shield to all who trust in Him.

(2 Samuel 22:32) 
For who is God except the Lord? And who is strong besides our God?

(2 Samuel 22:33) 
God is the one who has girded me with strength and made my path perfect.

(2 Samuel 22:34) 
He made my feet like those of deer, enabling me to stand firm on my high places.

(2 Samuel 22:35) 
He trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

(2 Samuel 22:36) 
You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your gentleness has made me great.

(2 Samuel 22:37) 
You will make my steps wide beneath me, and my ankles will not falter.

(2 Samuel 22:38) 
I will pursue my enemies and crush them; I will not turn back until I have destroyed them.

(2 Samuel 22:39) 
I will consume them and break them, so that they cannot rise; they will fall beneath my feet.

(2 Samuel 22:40) 
You have girded me with strength for the battle; You have subdued those who rise against me beneath my power.

(2 Samuel 23:1) 
These are the final words of David. David, the son of Jesse, declared them. Thus declared the man who was established by the Anointed One of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel:

(2 Samuel 23:2) 
The Spirit of the Lord has spoken through me, and His word has been on my tongue.

(2 Samuel 23:3) 
The God of Israel has spoken, the Strong One of Israel has spoken to me: 'The Ruler over humanity is a just ruler, ruling in the fear of God.'

(2 Samuel 23:4) 
His rule will be like the morning light when the sun rises without clouds, shining brightly. It will be like the grass that sprouts from the earth after the rains.

(2 Samuel 23:5) 
Indeed, my household is not so great before God, for He has made an eternal covenant with me, firm in all things and secured. For all my salvation and all my desire come from Him, and His covenant will not fail in the future.

(2 Samuel 23:6) 
But all the sons of Belial (worthless men) are like burning thorns that cannot be grasped by hand.

(2 Samuel 23:7) 
And if anyone wishes to touch them, he must be armed with iron and a spear shaft, and they will be utterly consumed by fire in that very place.

(2 Samuel 23:8) 
These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: Isboseth, who sat on the throne, the wisest prince among the top three warriors. He was like a very tender worm in wood, yet he killed eight hundred men in one attack.

(2 Samuel 23:9) 
After him was Eleazar, the son of his uncle Ahohite, one of the three mighty men who were with David when they defied the Philistines, who had gathered there for battle.

(2 Samuel 23:10) 
When the men of Israel had gone up, he stood firm and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and stiff from holding his sword. The Lord brought about a great victory on that day, and the people who had fled returned only to plunder the dead.

(2 Samuel 23:11) 
And after him was Semma, the son of Age from Arari. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi; there was a field full of lentils there. When the people fled from the Philistines,

(2 Samuel 23:12) 
He himself stood in the middle of the field and defended it. He struck down the Philistines, and the Lord brought about a great victory.

(2 Samuel 23:13) 
Three of the thirty chief warriors went down and came to David during the rye harvest, into the cave of Odollam. The Philistine army was encamped in the valley of Raphaim.

(2 Samuel 23:14) 
And David was in a stronghold there, while the Philistine outpost was then in Bethlehem.

(2 Samuel 23:15) 
David then expressed a longing, saying, 'If only someone would give me water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which is near the gate!'

(2 Samuel 23:16) 
So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which was at the gate. They brought it to David, but David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord, saying:

(2 Samuel 23:17) 
'May the Lord be merciful to me, that I should not do this. Should I drink the blood of these men who went risking their very lives?' And he refused to drink it. These three mighty deeds were performed by the strongest warriors.

(2 Samuel 23:18) 
Abisai also, the brother of Joab, son of Sarvia, was a chief among a group of three. He was the one who lifted his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and he was renowned among this group of three.

(2 Samuel 23:19) 
And he was the most powerful among these three, and he became their commander. Nevertheless, he did not reach the status of the first three (the top warriors).

(2 Samuel 23:20) 
Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was a very robust man, capable of great deeds, from Cabseel. He struck down two lion-like men of Moab, and he also went down into a cistern and struck down a lion on a snowy day.

(2 Samuel 23:21) 
He also killed an Egyptian man of extraordinary stature, who had a spear in his hand. Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.

(2 Samuel 23:22) 
These deeds were done by Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada.

(2 Samuel 23:23) 
And he was renowned among the three powerful ones, who themselves were considered more noble than the thirty other warriors; nevertheless, he did not attain the rank of the first three (top warriors). David made him his privy counselor.

(2 Samuel 23:24) 
Asael, Joab's brother, was among the thirty warriors; Eleanan, the son of his uncle, from Bethlehem.

(2 Samuel 23:25) 
Samma from Harodi, Elica from Harodi.

(2 Samuel 23:26) 
Heles from Palti, Hira, the son of Acces, from Thecua.

(2 Samuel 23:27) 
Abiezer from Anathoth, Mobonnai from Husati.

(2 Samuel 23:28) 
Selmon, an Ahohite; Maharai, a Netophathite.

(2 Samuel 23:29) 
Heled, the son of Banaa, from Netophath; Ithai, the son of Ribai, from Gabaath of the children of Benjamin.

(2 Samuel 23:30) 
Benaiah, a Pharathonite; Hiddai from Nahale Gaas.

(2 Samuel 23:31) 
Abialbon, an Arbathite; Azmaveth from Beromi.

(2 Samuel 23:32) 
Eliaba from Saalboni, along with the sons of Jasen: Jonathan.

(2 Samuel 23:33) 
Samma from Arari, Ahiam, the son of Sarar, from Arari.

(2 Samuel 23:34) 
Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai, the son of Machati; Eliam, the son of Achitophel, a Gelonite.

(2 Samuel 23:35) 
Hesrai from Carmelo, Pharai from Arbi.

(2 Samuel 23:36) 
Igaal, the son of Nathan, from Soba; Bonni from Gadi.

(2 Samuel 23:37) 
Selec, an Ammonite; Naharai, a Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab, the son of Sarvia.

(2 Samuel 23:38) 
Ira, a Jethrite; Gareb, a Jethrite.

(2 Samuel 23:39) 
Uriah, the Hethite.

(2 Samuel 23:40) 
In total, there were thirty-seven.

(2 Samuel 23:1) 
These are David's last words. David, Jesse's son, declared this message: The man who was established by the God of Jacob as His anointed ruler, the renowned psalmist of Israel, spoke this revelation.

(2 Samuel 23:2) 
The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me, and His message was on my tongue.

(2 Samuel 23:3) 
The God of Israel spoke to me. The Strong One of Israel declared this truth: The Ruler of all humanity is a just ruler, governing in the reverent fear of God.

(2 Samuel 23:4) 
His rule is like the morning light, shining brightly when the sun rises without clouds. It is like the rain that makes the earth sprout with life.

(2 Samuel 23:5) 
Indeed, my royal house is not so great in God's sight, that He would enter into an eternal covenant with me, steadfast in every way and secured. Yet, this is all my salvation and all my desire; and even if no heir of mine should truly flourish by his own power, God's promise stands.

(2 Samuel 23:6) 
But the wicked are all like thorns that have been torn out, which cannot be gathered by hand. If anyone desires to handle them, he must arm himself with iron and a spear, for they will surely be consumed by fire right where they are found.

(2 Samuel 23:7) 
These are the names of David's mighty warriors. Josheb-basshebeth, the wisest chief among the three, was the same as Adino the Eznite, who with a single attack killed eight hundred men.

(2 Samuel 23:8) 
After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was among the three mighty warriors with David. They were with David when they defied the Philistines, who had gathered there for battle. When the men of Israel had retreated,

(2 Samuel 23:9) 
Eleazar stood firm and fought the Philistines until his hand grew weary and stiff, clenched to his sword. And the Lord brought about a great victory on that day. The people who had fled then returned, but only to plunder the slain.

(2 Samuel 23:10) 
After Eleazar was Shammah, son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered in Lehi, where there was a field full of lentils. When the people fled from the Philistines,

(2 Samuel 23:11) 
Shammah stood his ground in the middle of the field and defended it. He struck down the Philistines, and the Lord brought about a great victory.

(2 Samuel 23:12) 
Three of the thirty chief warriors went down and came to David during harvest time at the cave of Adullam. At that time, the Philistine camp was set up in the Valley of Rephaim.

(2 Samuel 23:13) 
At that time, David was in a stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.

(2 Samuel 23:14) 
So David longed for water and said: 'Oh, if only someone would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the city gate!'

(2 Samuel 23:15) 
So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well of Bethlehem, which was by the city gate. They brought it to David, but David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord,

(2 Samuel 23:16) 
saying: 'May the Lord forbid that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?' And because of this, he would not drink it. These were the deeds of the three mighty warriors.

(2 Samuel 23:17) 
Abishai, the brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He was the one who lifted his spear against three hundred men and killed them; he became renowned among the three.

(2 Samuel 23:18) 
He was the first among the three, and much more illustrious than the other two, and he became their commander. Nevertheless, he did not reach the level of the first three mighty warriors.

(2 Samuel 23:19) 
Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, a very mighty man who performed great deeds, came from Kabzeel. He killed two of Moab's most powerful warriors. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day.

(2 Samuel 23:20) 
He also struck down an Egyptian, a man of remarkable stature, who had a spear in his hand. Benaiah went down to him with only a staff, wrestled the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and then killed him with his own spear.

(2 Samuel 23:21) 
These were the deeds of Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and he became renowned among the three mighty warriors.

(2 Samuel 23:22) 
He was the chief of the thirty, though he did not reach the level of the first three. David appointed him as his chief counselor.

(2 Samuel 23:23) 
Among the thirty were Asahel, Joab's brother, and Elhanan, son of Dodo from Bethlehem.

(2 Samuel 24:1) 
The Lord’s just anger continued to burn against Israel. He stirred up David to act against them, saying, “Go, take a census of the men of Israel and Judah.”

(2 Samuel 24:2) 
So the king told Joab, the commander of his army: “Go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, and count the people. I want to know their total number.”

(2 Samuel 24:3) 
But Joab replied to the king: “May the Lord your God increase the number of these people a hundredfold more than they are now! And may my lord the king live to see it with his own eyes. Why, then, does my lord the king want to do this thing?”

(2 Samuel 24:4) 
Yet the king insisted on his command to Joab and the army commanders. So Joab and the generals departed from the king’s presence to take a census of the people of Israel.

(2 Samuel 24:5) 
When they had crossed the Jordan River, they came to Aroer, and to the city that is on the right side of the valley of Gad.

(2 Samuel 24:6) 
From there, they went through Midian and Gilead, and into the lower land, that is, Hodesh. They came to the forested area of the Sun, which is the city of the Sidonians.

(2 Samuel 24:7) 
They then traveled from there, facing Tyre, and through all the land of the Hivites and Canaanites. They finally arrived in the south of Judah, at Beersheba.

(2 Samuel 24:8) 
After surveying all the land, they returned to Jerusalem after nine months and twenty days.

(2 Samuel 24:9) 
Joab reported the number of the registered people to the king: In Israel, there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who could wield a sword. In Judah, there were five hundred thousand fighting men.

(2 Samuel 24:10) 
But David’s conscience troubled him after he had counted the people. So he said to the Lord: “I have sinned greatly in this act. But I beg You, Lord, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted foolishly.”

(2 Samuel 24:11) 
When David rose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying:

(2 Samuel 24:12) 
“Go, and speak to David: ‘This is what the Lord says: I offer you three choices. Choose one, and I will bring it upon you.’”

(2 Samuel 24:13) 
When Gad came to David, he reported to him, saying: “Either seven years of famine will come upon your land, or for three months you will flee from your adversaries as they pursue you, or for three days there will be a plague in your land. Now then, decide, and see what answer I should give to the One who sent me.”

(2 Samuel 24:14) 
And David said to Gad: “I am in a very distressed situation. But it is better that I fall into the hand of the Lord, for His compassions are great, rather than into the hand of man.”

(2 Samuel 24:15) 
So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from that morning until the appointed time. And from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men among the people died.

(2 Samuel 24:16) 
When the angel extended his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the afflicted people. He said to the angel who was destroying the people: “Enough! Do not extend your hand further.” Now the Lord’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

(2 Samuel 24:17) 
And when David saw the angel striking the people, he said to the Lord: “It is I who have sinned, I have acted wickedly. These people are like sheep; what have they done? I beg You, let Your hand be turned against me and against my father’s house.”

(2 Samuel 24:18) 
Now Gad came to David on that day and said to him: “Go up and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”

(2 Samuel 24:19) 
So David went up, just as Gad had told him, according to the Lord’s command.

(2 Samuel 24:20) 
Araunah looked up and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So he went out to meet the king and prostrated himself before him with his face to the ground, showing his respect.

(2 Samuel 24:21) 
And Araunah said: “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David replied to him: “To buy the threshing floor from you, so I can build an altar to the Lord and stop the plague of death from affecting the people.”

(2 Samuel 24:22) 
Araunah said to David: “Let my lord the king take and offer whatever pleases him. You have oxen here for a burnt offering, and the threshing sledges, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.”

(2 Samuel 24:23) 
Araunah the king gave all these things to the king. And Araunah said to the king: “May the Lord your God be gracious to you.”

(2 Samuel 24:24) 
But the king replied to him: “No, not as you wish. I will certainly buy it from you for a price. For I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty silver shekels.

(2 Samuel 24:25) 
And David built an altar there to the Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the Lord was moved to mercy for the land, and the plague was lifted from Israel.
