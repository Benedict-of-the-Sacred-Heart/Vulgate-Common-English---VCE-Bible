(Genesis 1:1) 
In the beginning, God created the universe and the earth.

(Genesis 1:2) 
The earth wasn't finished yet.
The matter of the earth was present but not yet formed or inhabited, and it was dark,
and God's Spirit was there, hovering over the unformed earth.

(Genesis 1:3) 
God then created light by saying "Let there be light!"

(Genesis 1:4) 
God saw that the light was good
and caused the light to travel through the darkness of space.

(Genesis 1:5) 
He called the time when it is bright "day",
and the time when it is dark "night". The first ever evening and morning passed—the first day of all of history.

(Genesis 1:6) 
And God said: "Let there be an atmosphere to separate Earth from the rest of creation."

(Genesis 1:7) 
So God made the atmosphere
between the unformed Earth
and the rest of the universe that was still being formed,
and the Earth was separated from the rest of the universe.

(Genesis 1:8) 
He called the atmosphere "the sky".
Evening and morning then came, the second day.

(Genesis 1:9) 
God said "Let the oceans and land of the earth appear and take their proper places."
And it was immediately so.

(Genesis 1:10) 
And God called the oceans "the sea"
and the dry ground "land",
and God saw that it was good.

(Genesis 1:11) 
And God said, “Let the earth sprout every sort of plant.
Let there be all types of grasses, herbs, and trees, including those that produce fruit.
Let the plants produce seeds that grow into the same species of plant.”
After God said this, the earth was filled with plant life.

(Genesis 1:12) 
The earth then produced lush plant life. It brought forth all types of grasses and herbs, each with seeds that would reproduce its own kind. It also brought forth trees that produced fruit, each with its own seeds that would reproduce its own kind. God saw that this was good.

(Genesis 1:13) 
Evening and morning passed; it was the third day.

(Genesis 1:14) 
God then said, "Let there be sources of light in the sky to separate day from night. Let them serve as indicators for marking holy days, seasons, days, and years.

(Genesis 1:15) 
Let them shine in the sky to illuminate the earth." And so it was.

(Genesis 1:16) 
God created two great sources of light: the sun, the greater light, to govern the day, and the moon, the lesser light, to govern the night. He also created the stars.

(Genesis 1:17) 
God placed these sources of light in the sky to shine upon the earth,

(Genesis 1:18) 
and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that this was good.

(Genesis 1:19) 
Evening and morning passed; it was the fourth day.

(Genesis 1:20) 
God also said, "Let the waters teem with every type of living creature, and let birds fly above the earth, across the sky."

(Genesis 1:21) 
So God created the great sea monsters and every other living creature that moves, with which the waters teem, each according to its species. He also created every winged bird according to its species. God saw that this was good.

(Genesis 1:22) 
God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas. And let the birds multiply on the earth."

(Genesis 1:23) 
Evening and morning passed; it was the fifth day.

(Genesis 1:24) 
God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its species." And so it was.

(Genesis 1:25) 
God made the wild animals of the earth according to their species, the cattle according to their species, and all creatures that move along the ground according to their species. God saw that this was good.

(Genesis 1:26) 
Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creature that moves along the ground."

(Genesis 1:27) 
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God, He created him. He created them male and female.

(Genesis 1:28) 
God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living creature that moves on the earth."

(Genesis 1:29) 
Then God said, "Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. These will be your food.

(Genesis 1:30) 
And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to every creature that moves along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food." And so it was.

(Genesis 1:31) 
God looked at everything He had made, and indeed, it was very good. Evening and morning passed; it was the sixth day.

(Genesis 2:1) 
So, the universe and the earth, and all that fills them, were finished.

(Genesis 2:2) 
By the seventh day, God had finished all the work of creation He had been doing. He ceased His work on the seventh day, resting from everything He had made.

(Genesis 2:3) 
And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on that day He had finished all His work of creation.

(Genesis 2:4) 
This is the historical account of the universe and the earth at their creation, at the time when the Lord God made the universe and the earth.

(Genesis 2:5) 
There was no plant yet growing in the field, nor had any herb of the region sprouted. For the Lord God had not yet caused rain to fall upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the land.

(Genesis 2:6) 
Instead, a spring of water would rise up from the earth, watering the entire surface of the ground.

(Genesis 2:7) 
So the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and He breathed into his face the breath of life, and thus man became a living soul.

(Genesis 2:8) 
Then the Lord God had planted the Garden of Paradise in the beginning towards the East, and there He placed the man whom He had formed.

(Genesis 2:9) 
And the Lord God caused to grow from the ground every tree that was pleasing to the eye and good for food. He also placed the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

(Genesis 2:10) 
A river flowed out of the place of delight to water the Garden, and from there it divided into four branches.

(Genesis 2:11) 
The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the entire land of Havilah, where gold is found.

(Genesis 2:12) 
The gold of that land is of excellent quality. Bdellium (a fragrant resin) and the onyx stone are also found there.

(Genesis 2:13) 
The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the entire land of Cush (Ethiopia).

(Genesis 2:14) 
The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows eastward toward Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.

(Genesis 2:15) 
Therefore, the Lord God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Paradise to cultivate and keep it.

(Genesis 2:16) 
And the Lord God gave the man this command, saying: "From every tree of the Garden you may freely eat.

(Genesis 2:17) 
But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat; for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die."

(Genesis 2:18) 
Then the Lord God said: "It is not good for man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him."

(Genesis 2:19) 
So, the Lord God, having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the sky, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.

(Genesis 2:20) 
Adam gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to all the beasts of the field. But for Adam himself, no suitable helper was found.

(Genesis 2:21) 
So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. And while he was sleeping, God took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh in its place.

(Genesis 2:22) 
And the Lord God formed the rib, which He had taken from Adam, into a woman, and He brought her to Adam.

(Genesis 2:23) 
Then Adam said: "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh! She shall be called 'Woman' because she was taken out of Man."

(Genesis 2:24) 
Therefore, a man will leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

(Genesis 2:25) 
And the man and his wife were both naked, but they felt no shame.

(Genesis 3:1) 
Now, the serpent was the most cunning creature among all the animals the Lord God had made on the earth. It came to the woman and said, 'Why did God give you a command that you should not eat from *any* tree in this entire Garden?' —the serpent twisted God's actual prohibition, making it sound like they were forbidden from everything.

(Genesis 3:2) 
The woman answered the serpent, 'We may eat the fruit from the trees throughout the Garden;'

(Genesis 3:3) 
but from the fruit of the tree that stands in the very center of the Garden, God has strictly commanded us not to eat, nor even to touch it—an addition the woman made to God's original command—lest we die.'

(Genesis 3:4) 
But the serpent said to the woman, 'No, you will not die at all!'

(Genesis 3:5) 
For God knows that on the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will become like gods, knowing both good and evil, just as He does.'

(Genesis 3:6) 
Therefore, the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was beautiful to the eyes, and that it was delightful to look at. She then took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate it.

(Genesis 3:7) 
And the eyes of both of them were indeed opened, not to wisdom but to shame; and when they realized they were naked, they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves to hide their nakedness.

(Genesis 3:8) 
And when they heard the voice of the Lord God, Who was walking about in the Garden during the cool afternoon breeze, Adam and his wife immediately hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, concealing themselves among the trees of the garden.

(Genesis 3:9) 
And the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, 'Where are you?'

(Genesis 3:10) 
He answered, 'I heard Your voice in the Garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.'

(Genesis 3:11) 
And God said to him, 'Who told you that you were naked, unless it was because you had eaten from the very tree about which I commanded you not to eat?'

(Genesis 3:12) 
And Adam said, 'The woman You gave to be my companion—she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.'

(Genesis 3:13) 
And the Lord God said to the woman, 'What is this that you have done?' And she replied, 'The serpent cleverly deceived me, and so I ate.'

(Genesis 3:14) 
And the Lord God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, you are cursed above all living creatures and all beasts of the earth. You shall crawl on your belly, and you shall metaphorically eat the dust of the earth—meaning, you shall always be humbled and defeated—all the days of your life.'

(Genesis 3:15) 
I will put enmities, a spiritual warfare, between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. She, the Woman, shall crush your head—a prophecy of Mary and her Son, Jesus Christ, triumphing over you—and you, in turn, shall lie in wait for her heel, attempting to wound Him.

(Genesis 3:16) 
To the woman He also said, 'I will greatly multiply your sorrows and your painful conceptions. In great pain you shall give birth to children; and you shall be subject to your husband's authority, and he shall rule over you.'

(Genesis 3:17) 
And to Adam He said, 'Because you listened to the voice of your wife, and ate from the tree concerning which I specifically commanded you, "You shall not eat from it," therefore, the very ground is now cursed because of your deed. You shall eat from it only through hard labor and toil all the days of your life.'

(Genesis 3:18) 
Thorns and thistles shall the earth bring forth for you, and you shall eat the wild plants of the field to survive.

(Genesis 3:19) 
By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the very ground from which you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return in death.

(Genesis 3:20) 
And Adam called the name of his wife 'Eve'—meaning 'life-giver'—because she would be the mother of all who live.

(Genesis 3:21) 
And the Lord God also made garments of animal skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them with these, providing a more lasting covering than their fig leaves and foreshadowing future atonement.

(Genesis 3:22) 
And the Lord God said, 'Behold, Adam has now become like one of Us—meaning, like the divine beings in heaven—by knowing good and evil in a fallen way. Now, therefore, lest he reach out his hand and also take from the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever in this fallen state—'

(Genesis 3:23) 
Therefore, the Lord God sent Adam out from the Garden of Eden—the Garden of Paradise—so that he might work the very ground from which he was taken, as a consequence of his sin.

(Genesis 3:24) 
And so He drove Adam out; and at the eastern side of the Garden of Paradise, He stationed Cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way, to guard the path to the Tree of Life and prevent humanity from reaching it in their fallen state.

(Genesis 4:1) 
Adam knew his wife, Eve. She conceived and gave birth to Cain, saying, "I have gotten a man through God."

(Genesis 4:2) 
Again, she gave birth to his brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the ground.

(Genesis 4:3) 
After a period of many days, Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the produce of the earth.

(Genesis 4:4) 
Abel also offered from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. The Lord looked with favor upon Abel and his offering.

(Genesis 4:5) 
But upon Cain and his offering, He did not look with favor. Cain became extremely angry, and his face fell.

(Genesis 4:6) 
Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has your face fallen?"

(Genesis 4:7) 
If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is waiting at the door, and its desire is for you, but you must master it.

(Genesis 4:8) 
Cain then spoke to his brother Abel, saying, "Let us go out to the field." When they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and murdered him.

(Genesis 4:9) 
Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He answered, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"

(Genesis 4:10) 
And He said to him, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the earth!"

(Genesis 4:11) 
Now, therefore, you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.

(Genesis 4:12) 
When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You shall be a restless wanderer on the earth.

(Genesis 4:13) 
And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is too great for me to bear."

(Genesis 4:14) 
Behold, today you are driving me from the face of the earth, and from your presence I shall be hidden. I shall be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."

(Genesis 4:15) 
Then the Lord said to him, "Not so! If anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." And the Lord put a protective mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.

(Genesis 4:16) 
So Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and lived as an exile in the land of Nod, to the east of Eden.

(Genesis 4:17) 
Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Cain then built a city and named it Enoch, after his son.

(Genesis 4:18) 
To Enoch was born Irad. Irad begot Maviael. Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech.

(Genesis 4:19) 
Lamech took two wives. The name of the first was Ada, and the name of the second was Sella.

(Genesis 4:20) 
Ada gave birth to Jabal. He became the father of those who dwell in tents and keep livestock.

(Genesis 4:21) 
His brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all who play the lyre and the pipe.

(Genesis 4:22) 
Sella also gave birth to Tubalcain, who was an instructor and smith in every kind of bronze and iron work. The sister of Tubalcain was Noema.

(Genesis 4:23) 
Then Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella: "Hear my voice, wives of Lamech; listen to my speech. For I have killed a man who wounded me, and a young man who bruised me."

(Genesis 4:24) 
If vengeance for Cain was sevenfold, then for Lamech it will be seventy-sevenfold.

(Genesis 4:25) 
Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has appointed for me another child in place of Abel, whom Cain murdered."

(Genesis 4:26) 
To Seth also a son was born, whom he named Enos. It was then that people began to invoke the name of the Lord.

(Genesis 5:1) 
This is the record of Adam's lineage. At the time when God created mankind, He made him in God's own likeness.

(Genesis 5:2) 
He created them as male and female. He blessed them, and He called their collective name 'Mankind' (Adam), at the time they were created.

(Genesis 5:3) 
Adam lived for one hundred and thirty years, and then he begot a son in his own image and likeness, whom he named Seth.

(Genesis 5:4) 
After he begot Seth, Adam lived for eight hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:5) 
Adam lived for a total of nine hundred and thirty years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:6) 
Seth also lived for one hundred and five years, and then he begot Enos.

(Genesis 5:7) 
After he begot Enos, Seth lived for eight hundred and seven more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:8) 
Seth lived for a total of nine hundred and twelve years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:9) 
Enos lived for ninety years, and then he begot Cainan.

(Genesis 5:10) 
After he begot Cainan, Enos lived for eight hundred and fifteen more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:11) 
Enos lived for a total of nine hundred and five years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:12) 
Cainan lived for seventy years, and then he begot Malaleel.

(Genesis 5:13) 
After he begot Malaleel, Cainan lived for eight hundred and forty more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:14) 
Cainan lived for a total of nine hundred and ten years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:15) 
Malaleel lived for sixty-five years, and then he begot Jared.

(Genesis 5:16) 
After he begot Jared, Malaleel lived for eight hundred and thirty more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:17) 
Malaleel lived for a total of eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:18) 
Jared also lived for one hundred and sixty-two years, and then he begot Enoch.

(Genesis 5:19) 
After he begot Enoch, Jared lived for eight hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:20) 
Jared lived for a total of nine hundred and sixty-two years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:21) 
Enoch lived for sixty-five years, and then he begot Methuselah.

(Genesis 5:22) 
And Enoch walked closely with God. After he begot Methuselah, Enoch lived for three hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:23) 
Enoch lived for a total of three hundred and sixty-five years.

(Genesis 5:24) 
Enoch continued to walk closely with God, and then he was no longer seen, because God took him from the earth.

(Genesis 5:25) 
Methuselah also lived for one hundred and eighty-seven years, and then he begot Lamech.

(Genesis 5:26) 
After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived for seven hundred and eighty-two more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:27) 
Methuselah lived for a total of nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:28) 
Lamech lived for one hundred and eighty-two years, and then he begot a son.

(Genesis 5:29) 
He named the boy Noah, saying, 'This son will bring us comfort from our toil and from the hard labor of our hands, which comes from the earth that the Lord God has cursed.'

(Genesis 5:30) 
After he begot Noah, Lamech lived for five hundred and ninety-five more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 5:31) 
Lamech lived for a total of seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and then he died.

(Genesis 5:32) 
When Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

(Genesis 6:1) 
And when human beings began to multiply on the earth, and they had given birth to daughters,

(Genesis 6:2) 
the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they chose wives for themselves from all of them whom they desired.

(Genesis 6:3) 
And God said, "My Spirit will not always strive within man, because man is merely flesh. Therefore, his days will be limited to one hundred and twenty years."

(Genesis 6:4) 
Now, giants were on the earth in those days—and even after—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men, and they bore children. These were the mighty ones of ancient times, men of renown and fame.

(Genesis 6:5) 
But God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and without ceasing.

(Genesis 6:6) 
And God regretted that He had made man on the earth. He was grieved in His heart by man's evil.

(Genesis 6:7) 
God said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth—from man to beast, from creeping thing to the birds of the sky—for I regret that I have made them."

(Genesis 6:8) 
But Noah found grace and favor in the sight of the Lord.

(Genesis 6:9) 
These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, blameless and upright in his generations; Noah walked with God.

(Genesis 6:10) 
And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

(Genesis 6:11) 
The earth, however, was corrupt before God; the earth was filled with iniquity and violence.

(Genesis 6:12) 
When God saw that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth—their moral path was depraved),

(Genesis 6:13) 
God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me; for the earth is filled with iniquity and violence because of them. And behold, I will destroy them with the earth."

(Genesis 6:14) 
Make yourself an ark of smooth, polished gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ark, and you shall pitch it with asphalt inside and out to make it watertight.

(Genesis 6:15) 
And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. (A cubit is approximately 18 inches, so about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, 45 feet high).

(Genesis 6:16) 
You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit above; and the door of the ark you shall set in its side. You shall make lower, second, and third decks in it.

(Genesis 6:17) 
For behold, I, myself, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the spirit of life from under the sky. Everything that is on the earth shall die.

(Genesis 6:18) 
But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.

(Genesis 6:19) 
And from every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.

(Genesis 6:20) 
Of birds after their kind, and of livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, so they may live.

(Genesis 6:21) 
And you shall take for yourself every sort of food that is eaten, and you shall gather it into the ark. And it shall be food for you and for them.

(Genesis 6:22) 
Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.

(Genesis 7:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Noah, saying, "Go into the ark, you and your whole household. I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation."

(Genesis 7:2) 
"From all of the clean animals, take seven pairs—a male and a female of each. But from the unclean animals, take only two—one male and one female of each."

(Genesis 7:3) 
"And from the birds of the sky, take seven pairs of each, a male and a female. This is so that their offspring may be preserved on the face of the entire earth after the flood."

(Genesis 7:4) 
"For in exactly seven days, I will send rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will then wipe out every living thing that I have made from the face of the earth."

(Genesis 7:5) 
So Noah did everything that the Lord had commanded him to do.

(Genesis 7:6) 
Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters began to swell over the earth.

(Genesis 7:7) 
Noah entered the ark because of the floodwaters. His sons, his wife, and his sons' wives also entered with him.

(Genesis 7:8) 
All the animals, both clean and unclean, and all the birds, and all the creeping creatures that move upon the earth—

(Genesis 7:9) 
—they entered the ark with Noah, two by two, a male and a female of each, just as the Lord had commanded Noah.

(Genesis 7:10) 
After the seven days had passed, the floodwaters began to swell over the earth.

(Genesis 7:11) 
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month of that year, all the subterranean fountains of the great deep burst forth. At the same time, the floodgates of the sky were opened wide.

(Genesis 7:12) 
And heavy rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights without stopping.

(Genesis 7:13) 
On that same day, Noah, and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with Noah's wife and his three daughters-in-law, all entered the ark.

(Genesis 7:14) 
With them went every kind of wild animal, every kind of domestic animal, every kind of creeping creature that moves on the earth, and every kind of bird and winged creature—all of them according to their own species.

(Genesis 7:15) 
They entered the ark with Noah, two by two, from every living creature that had the breath of life in it.

(Genesis 7:16) 
Those that entered were male and female from every kind of living creature, just as the Lord had commanded Noah. Then the Lord himself shut the door securely behind Noah.

(Genesis 7:17) 
The flood continued for forty days upon the earth. The waters swelled, lifting the ark high, so it was raised up from the ground.

(Genesis 7:18) 
The waters became exceedingly mighty and covered everything on the surface of the earth. But the ark floated securely on the surface of the waters.

(Genesis 7:19) 
The waters prevailed with extreme might over the earth. All the high mountains that were under the entire sky were completely covered by the flood.

(Genesis 7:20) 
The water rose fifteen cubits (about twenty-two feet) above the highest mountains, completely submerging them.

(Genesis 7:21) 
Every living creature that moved on the earth perished: all birds, all wild animals, all domestic beasts, all creeping creatures that crawled on the earth, and all mankind.

(Genesis 7:22) 
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.

(Genesis 7:23) 
God wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the earth, from man to domestic animal, and all creeping creatures, and all birds of the sky. They were all utterly destroyed from the earth. Only Noah remained alive, along with those who were with him in the ark.

(Genesis 7:24) 
The waters covered the earth and remained at their height for one hundred and fifty days.

(Genesis 8:1) 
But the Lord took Noah and all the living creatures and all the cattle that were with him in the ark to heart. He sent a powerful wind across the earth, and the floodwaters began to recede.

(Genesis 8:2) 
And the underground springs that supplied the floodwaters were closed, and the floodgates of the sky were shut. The rain from the sky was stopped.

(Genesis 8:3) 
The waters continued to recede from the earth, constantly flowing back and forth. After one hundred and fifty days, they began to significantly diminish.

(Genesis 8:4) 
And in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat (which are in Armenia).

(Genesis 8:5) 
However, the waters continued to recede and diminish until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.

(Genesis 8:6) 
And it happened that after forty days had passed, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made, and he released a raven.

(Genesis 8:7) 
The raven flew out and did not return to the ark, as it waited for the waters upon the earth to dry completely.

(Genesis 8:8) 
Then Noah also sent out a dove after the raven, to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the earth.

(Genesis 8:9) 
But the dove could not find any place to rest its foot, because the waters still covered the entire surface of the earth. So it returned to Noah in the ark. Noah reached out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back inside the ark.

(Genesis 8:10) 
Noah waited for seven more days, and again he released the dove from the ark.

(Genesis 8:11) 
And the dove came back to him in the evening, carrying a fresh olive branch with green leaves in its beak. So Noah understood that the waters had finally receded from the earth.

(Genesis 8:12) 
Noah waited for seven more days, and then he released the dove again. This time, it did not return to him.

(Genesis 8:13) 
Therefore, in the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, in the first month, on the first day of that month, the waters had receded from the earth. Noah opened the covering of the ark, looked out, and saw that the surface of the land was dry.

(Genesis 8:14) 
In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the entire earth was dry.

(Genesis 8:15) 
Then God spoke to Noah, saying:

(Genesis 8:16) 
 'Come out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.

(Genesis 8:17) 
 'Bring out with you all the living creatures that are with you, from every kind of flesh: the birds, the cattle, and all the creeping things that crawl upon the earth. Go forth onto the earth, and grow in number, and multiply upon it.' 

(Genesis 8:18) 
So Noah went out, and his wife, and his sons, and his sons' wives with him.

(Genesis 8:19) 
And all the living creatures, all the creeping things, and all the birds, everything that moves upon the earth, came out of the ark according to their kinds.

(Genesis 8:20) 
Then Noah built an altar to the Lord. And taking from every clean animal and every clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar.

(Genesis 8:21) 
And the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma of the sacrifice, and He said in His heart: 'Never again will I curse the earth because of humans, for the intention and the inclination of the human heart are prone to evil from its youth. Therefore, I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done.

(Genesis 8:22) 
 'For all the days the earth endures, planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall never cease.' 

(Genesis 9:1) 
God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the entire earth."

(Genesis 9:2) 
And your powerful presence and authority shall be upon all the animals of the land, and upon all the birds of the sky, with all the creatures that move upon the earth; all the fish of the sea are now given into your control.

(Genesis 9:3) 
Every moving, living thing will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants before the flood, I have now given you all these things to eat.

(Genesis 9:4) 
But you shall not eat the flesh of an animal with its blood still in it, because its life is in its blood.

(Genesis 9:5) 
For I will certainly demand an account for the blood that holds your life; I will demand it from every wild beast, and from the hand of man. Indeed, from the hand of every man and his brother, I will demand an account for the life of a human being.

(Genesis 9:6) 
Whoever sheds human blood, his blood shall also be shed in return; for indeed, God made man in His own divine image and likeness.

(Genesis 9:7) 
But as for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and fill it.

(Genesis 9:8) 
Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons who were with him, saying:

(Genesis 9:9) 
"Behold, I am now establishing my solemn covenant with you and with your descendants who will come after you."

(Genesis 9:10) 
"And with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and every wild beast of the earth that is with you—all that came out of the ark, and indeed, all the living creatures of the earth."

(Genesis 9:11) 
"I establish my covenant with you: never again shall all living creatures be cut off by the waters of a flood; nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy the entire earth."

(Genesis 9:12) 
And God said, "This is the sign of my solemn covenant, which I now give between me and you, and between me and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:"

(Genesis 9:13) 
"I will place my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between me and the entire earth."

(Genesis 9:14) 
"And whenever I bring clouds over the sky, my rainbow will appear in those clouds."

(Genesis 9:15) 
"And I will remember my covenant that is between me and you, and with every living creature that possesses life; never again shall the waters of a flood destroy all living creatures."

(Genesis 9:16) 
"So the rainbow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the everlasting covenant, which was established between God and every living creature of all flesh upon the earth."

(Genesis 9:17) 
And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all living creatures upon the entire earth."

(Genesis 9:18) 
The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the one who became the father of Canaan.

(Genesis 9:19) 
These three are the sons of Noah, and from these three, the entire earth was populated.

(Genesis 9:20) 
Noah, a farmer, was the first to cultivate the land and he planted a vineyard.

(Genesis 9:21) 
He drank some wine and became drunk, and was lying uncovered inside his tent.

(Genesis 9:22) 
And when Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness, he went out and told his two brothers.

(Genesis 9:23) 
But Shem and Japheth took a cloak, laid it on both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned away so they did not see their father's nakedness.

(Genesis 9:24) 
When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his younger son—Ham—had done to him,

(Genesis 9:25) 
He said, "Cursed be Canaan! He shall be the lowest of servants to his brothers."

(Genesis 9:26) 
Then he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem! And Canaan shall be his servant."

(Genesis 9:27) 
"May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall also be his servant."

(Genesis 9:28) 
Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years after the great flood.

(Genesis 9:29) 
And all the days of Noah's life were nine hundred and fifty years; then he died.

(Genesis 10:1) 
These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Children were born to them after the great flood that reset humanity.

(Genesis 10:2) 
The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Mosoch, and Thiras.

(Genesis 10:3) 
The sons of Gomer were Aschenez, Riphath, and Thogorma.

(Genesis 10:4) 
The sons of Javan were Elisa, Tharsis, Cetthim, and Dodanim.

(Genesis 10:5) 
From these descendants, the peoples of the nations spread out to their own lands, each according to their language, their families, and their nations.

(Genesis 10:6) 
The sons of Ham were Chus, Mesraim, Phuth, and Chanaan.

(Genesis 10:7) 
The sons of Chus were Saba, Hevila, Sabatha, Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma were Saba and Dadan.

(Genesis 10:8) 
Furthermore, Chus was the father of Nemrod. This Nemrod began to be a mighty leader on the earth.

(Genesis 10:9) 
He was a powerful hunter, a great man in the sight of the Lord. For this reason, it became a saying: 'Like Nemrod, a powerful hunter in the sight of the Lord.'

(Genesis 10:10) 
The beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne, in the land of Sennaar.

(Genesis 10:11) 
From that land, Assur went forth, and he built Ninive, and its city squares, and Calach.

(Genesis 10:12) 
He also built Resen, which is between Ninive and Calach. This is a great city.

(Genesis 10:13) 
Indeed, Mesraim was the father of Ludim, Anamim, Laabim, and Nephthuim.

(Genesis 10:14) 
And also Phetrusim and Casluim, from whom the Philisthiim and Caphtorim descended.

(Genesis 10:15) 
And Chanaan was the father of Sidon, his firstborn son, and also Hethæum.

(Genesis 10:16) 
And also the Jebusæum, Amorrhæum, and Gergesæum.

(Genesis 10:17) 
Also the Hevæum, Aracæum, and Sinæum.

(Genesis 10:18) 
And the Aradium, Samaræum, and Hamathæum. After this, the peoples of the Chananæans spread out.

(Genesis 10:19) 
The territory of Chanaan extended from Sidon, going towards Gerara as far as Gaza, and then to Sodom, Gomorrham, Adama, and Seboim, reaching as far as Lesa.

(Genesis 10:20) 
These are the descendants of Ham, organized by their family groups, languages, regions, and nations.

(Genesis 10:21) 
And children were also born to Shem, who was the father of all the descendants of Heber, and the elder brother of Japheth.

(Genesis 10:22) 
The sons of Shem were Ælam, Assur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

(Genesis 10:23) 
The sons of Aram were Us, Hul, Gether, and Mes.

(Genesis 10:24) 
Indeed, Arphaxad was the father of Sala, and from Sala, Heber was born.

(Genesis 10:25) 
To Heber, two sons were born. The name of one was Phaleg, because in his days the peoples of the earth were divided and spread out. And his brother's name was Jectan.

(Genesis 10:26) 
This Jectan was the father of Elmodad, Salaph, Asarmoth, and Jare.

(Genesis 10:27) 
And Aduram, Uzal, and Decla.

(Genesis 10:28) 
And Ebal, Abimaël, and Saba.

(Genesis 10:29) 
And Ophir, Hevila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Jectan.

(Genesis 10:30) 
Their dwelling place extended from Messa, as one travels towards Sephar, a mountain in the east.

(Genesis 10:31) 
These are the descendants of Shem, according to their family groups, languages, regions, and nations.

(Genesis 10:32) 
These are the family groups descended from Noah, according to their peoples and nations. From these, the nations of the earth spread out and divided after the great flood.

(Genesis 11:1) 
At that time, everyone on the whole earth spoke the same language, using the same words and expressions.

(Genesis 11:2) 
As people migrated from the east, they discovered a vast plain in the land called Shinar and chose to settle there.

(Genesis 11:3) 
Then people said to each other, 'Let us make bricks and burn them very thoroughly to make them strong.' They used these bricks instead of stones, and they used bitumen, a natural asphalt, as their mortar.

(Genesis 11:4) 
They also said, 'Come, let us build a great city for ourselves, and a tower that reaches so high it seems to touch the sky. This will establish our name and legacy, preventing us from being scattered across the face of the whole world.'

(Genesis 11:5) 
But then the Lord came down from His sublime dwelling —not because He needed to, but to observe the city and the tower that the children of Adam were building.

(Genesis 11:6) 
And the Lord said, 'See, they are one people, and they all speak a single language. This is only the beginning of what they plan to do; they will not stop pursuing their intentions until they have achieved them through their actions.'

(Genesis 11:7) 
Then He said, 'Come, let Us —the Holy Trinity— descend and there confuse their language, so that no one will be able to understand what his neighbor is saying.'

(Genesis 11:8) 
And in this way, the Lord scattered them from that place across the face of the whole earth. Because of this, they stopped building the city.

(Genesis 11:9) 
That is why the place was called Babel —meaning 'confusion'— because there the Lord confused the language of the entire world. From that place, the Lord scattered them across the face of all the regions of the earth.

(Genesis 11:10) 
These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old when his son Arphaxad was born, two years after the great flood.

(Genesis 11:11) 
After Arphaxad was born, Shem lived for another five hundred years, and during this time, he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:12) 
Arphaxad lived for thirty-five years, and then he became the father of Sala.

(Genesis 11:13) 
After Sala was born, Arphaxad lived for another three hundred and three years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:14) 
Sala lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Heber.

(Genesis 11:15) 
After Heber was born, Sala lived for another four hundred and three years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:16) 
Heber lived for thirty-four years, and then he became the father of Peleg.

(Genesis 11:17) 
After Peleg was born, Heber lived for another four hundred and thirty years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:18) 
Peleg lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Reu.

(Genesis 11:19) 
After Reu was born, Peleg lived for another two hundred and nine years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:20) 
Reu lived for thirty-two years, and then he became the father of Serug.

(Genesis 11:21) 
After Serug was born, Reu lived for another two hundred and seven years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:22) 
Serug lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Nahor.

(Genesis 11:23) 
After Nahor was born, Serug lived for another two hundred years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:24) 
Nahor lived for twenty-nine years, and then he became the father of Terah.

(Genesis 11:25) 
After Terah was born, Nahor lived for another one hundred and nineteen years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.

(Genesis 11:26) 
Terah lived for seventy years, and then he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

(Genesis 11:27) 
Now, these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.

(Genesis 11:28) 
However, Haran died in the land where he was born, in Ur of the Chaldeans, while his father Terah was still alive.

(Genesis 11:29) 
Abram and Nahor both took wives. Abram’s wife was named Sarai. Nahor’s wife was named Milcah, who was the daughter of Haran —meaning Milcah was also Haran's daughter, and the sister of Iscah.

(Genesis 11:30) 
However, Sarai was infertile and unable to have children.

(Genesis 11:31) 
So Terah gathered his son Abram, and his grandson Lot —who was Haran's son— and his daughter-in-law Sarai, who was Abram's wife. He led them out of Ur of the Chaldeans, intending to travel to the land of Canaan. But when they reached a place called Haran, they settled there instead.

(Genesis 11:32) 
Terah lived for a total of two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.

(Genesis 12:1) 
The Lord said to Abram, "Go out from your country, and away from your relatives, and away from your father's household. Come instead into the land that I will show you."

(Genesis 12:2) 
"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing for others."

(Genesis 12:3) 
"I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you. Through you, all the families of the earth will receive blessings."

(Genesis 12:4) 
So Abram immediately went out just as the Lord had commanded him; Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he went out from Haran, ready to begin his journey of faith.

(Genesis 12:5) 
Abram also took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions which they had acquired, and all the people they had gained while in Haran. They set out to go into the land of Canaan. And when they came into the land of Canaan,

(Genesis 12:6) 
Abram passed through the land as far as the place called Shechem, to the prominent valley. At that time, the Canaanites were living in that land, presenting an initial challenge for Abram.

(Genesis 12:7) 
Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, "I will give this very land to your descendants." So Abram, in an act of worship and thanksgiving, built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.

(Genesis 12:8) 
From there, he moved on to the mountain which was to the east of Bethel. He pitched his tent there, having the city of Bethel on his west and the city of Ai on his east. He also built another altar there to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord, continuing his journey of faith and worship.

(Genesis 12:9) 
And Abram journeyed further, continuing to move toward the southern regions of the land.

(Genesis 12:10) 
However, a severe famine occurred in the land where Abram was. So Abram went down into Egypt to reside there as a foreigner, for the famine in the land had become extremely severe.

(Genesis 12:11) 
When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, "I know that you are a very beautiful woman."

(Genesis 12:12) 
"When the Egyptians see you, they will surely say, 'She is his wife.' Then they will kill me to take you, but they will spare your life."

(Genesis 12:13) 
"Please say that you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on account of your beauty."

(Genesis 12:14) 
So when Abram had entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was exceedingly beautiful, just as Abram had feared.

(Genesis 12:15) 
And the princes of Pharaoh saw her and praised her to Pharaoh. Then the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house, an act which would later bring divine judgment.

(Genesis 12:16) 
And because of Sarai, Pharaoh treated Abram well. Abram received sheep, oxen, male donkeys, menservants, maidservants, and camels, enriching him greatly.

(Genesis 12:17) 
But the Lord, in His divine intervention, struck Pharaoh and his entire household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife, revealing her true relationship to Abram.

(Genesis 12:18) 
So Pharaoh called Abram and, angered by the deception, said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?"

(Genesis 12:19) 
"Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' leading me to take her as my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go, leave my land!"

(Genesis 12:20) 
And Pharaoh gave orders to his men concerning Abram, and they escorted him out, along with his wife and all that he had acquired while in Egypt.

(Genesis 13:1) 
So Abram went up from Egypt, with his wife and all their possessions. Lot also went with him to the southern region.

(Genesis 13:2) 
Now Abram was very rich with gold, silver, and many livestock.

(Genesis 13:3) 
He returned by the same route he had taken from the south, all the way to Bethel, to the place where he had first pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai.

(Genesis 13:4) 
It was where he had built an altar earlier, and there Abram worshipped the Lord, invoking His name.

(Genesis 13:5) 
However, Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had his own flocks, tents, and herds.

(Genesis 13:6) 
The land could not sustain them living together, because their possessions were so many that they could not dwell in the same area.

(Genesis 13:7) 
This led to a quarrel between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen. At that time, the Canaanites and the Perizzites also inhabited the land.

(Genesis 13:8) 
So Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no quarreling between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.”

(Genesis 13:9) 
“Is not the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you choose the left, I will go to the right. If you choose the right, I will go to the left.”

(Genesis 13:10) 
So Lot, raising his eyes, saw the entire region of the Jordan Plain, which was completely irrigated—this was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. It was like the Garden of the Lord, and like Egypt as you go toward Zoar.

(Genesis 13:11) 
Therefore, Lot chose for himself the entire Jordan Plain, and he moved eastward, and they were separated from one another.

(Genesis 13:12) 
Abram remained in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities near the Jordan and pitched his tents as far as Sodom.

(Genesis 13:13) 
Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked, and they were great sinners against the Lord.

(Genesis 13:14) 
And after Lot had separated from him, the Lord said to Abram, “Lift your eyes and look from the place where you now are, to the north, to the south, to the east, and to the west.”

(Genesis 13:15) 
“For all the land that you see, I will give to you and to your descendants forever.”

(Genesis 13:16) 
“And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth. If anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants will also be numbered.”

(Genesis 13:17) 
“Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth, for I am about to give it to you.”

(Genesis 13:18) 
So Abram moved his tent and came to dwell by the Oak of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.

(Genesis 14:1) 
Now, it happened during the time of Amraphel, who was king of Sennaar; and Arioch, who was king of Pontus; and Chedorlaomer, who was king of the Elamites; and Tidal, who was king of nations—

(Genesis 14:2) 
—all these kings gathered together in the Forest Valley, which is now known as the Salt Sea.

(Genesis 14:3) 
All of these rulers came together in the Forest Valley, which is the Salt Sea.

(Genesis 14:4) 
For twelve years, these kings from the Forest Valley had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled against him.

(Genesis 14:5) 
So, in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer came with the kings who were allied with him. They attacked the Rephaim people in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim people were with them, and also the Emim people in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

(Genesis 14:6) 
and they also attacked the Horite people in the mountains of Seir, extending all the way to the plains of Paran, which is in the wilderness.

(Genesis 14:7) 
Then, turning back, they arrived at the spring of Misphat, which is also called Kadesh. There, they struck down all the territory of the Amalekite people, and also the Amorite people who were living in Hazazonthamar.

(Genesis 14:8) 
Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela—which is also called Zoar—marched out. They arranged their battle lines against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Forest Valley,

(Genesis 14:9) 
—they were facing Chedorlaomer, king of the Elamites, Tidal, king of nations, Amraphel, king of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus. It was four kings against five.

(Genesis 14:10) 
The Forest Valley had many tar pits. So, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and their soldiers fell into the pits. Those who remained alive ran away into the mountains.

(Genesis 14:11) 
The victorious kings took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions of food, and then they left.

(Genesis 14:12) 
They also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and all his possessions from Sodom, and then they left.

(Genesis 14:13) 
Then, one of the people who had escaped from the battle came and reported all this to Abram the Hebrew. Abram was living in the valley of Mamre the Amorite, who was a brother of Eshcol and a brother of Aner. These men, Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner, were allied with Abram.

(Genesis 14:14) 
When Abram heard that his brother's son, Lot, had been captured, he immediately assembled his three hundred and eighteen trained servants, who had been born in his household. He then pursued the kings' army all the way to Dan.

(Genesis 14:15) 
He divided his men into groups and attacked the enemy by night. He struck them down and pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is located to the north of Damascus.

(Genesis 14:16) 
Abram recovered all the captured possessions. He also brought back Lot, his nephew, along with Lot's possessions, and all the women and the people who had been taken captive.

(Genesis 14:17) 
After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh, which was known as the King's Valley.

(Genesis 14:18) 
But then, Melchizedek, who was king of Salem, and also a priest of God Most High, came out. He brought bread and wine for Abram.

(Genesis 14:19) 
He blessed Abram, saying, 'May Abram be blessed by God Most High, who created the universe and the earth!'

(Genesis 14:20) 
And blessed be God Most High, who protected you and delivered your enemies into your power!' And then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the spoils he had recovered.

(Genesis 14:21) 
Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, 'Give me the people who were rescued, but you may keep all the remaining possessions for yourself.'

(Genesis 14:22) 
Abram replied to the king of Sodom, 'I raise my hand in an oath to the Lord God Most High, the One who possesses the universe and the earth—'

(Genesis 14:23) 
—I will not take anything that belongs to you, not even a single thread or a sandal strap. I do this so that you cannot say, 'I am the one who made Abram rich.'

(Genesis 14:24) 
However, I will not take anything for myself, except for the food my young men have already eaten. But as for Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, the men who came with me, they will certainly take their rightful share of the spoils.

(Genesis 15:1) 
After these things, the Lord God spoke to Abram, appearing to him in a vision. He said: 'Do not be afraid, Abram, for I am your protector, and your reward will be exceedingly great.'

(Genesis 15:2) 
Abram responded: 'Lord God, what can You give me? I am going on without an heir, and the one who manages my household, Eliezer of Damascus, is the only one who could inherit from me.'

(Genesis 15:3) 
And Abram added: 'You have given me no children, and behold, a servant born in my house is now my heir.'

(Genesis 15:4) 
Immediately, the Lord's word came to him, saying: 'This man will not be your heir. Instead, one who comes forth from your own body — he will be your heir.'

(Genesis 15:5) 
Then God led Abram outside and said to him: 'Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can.' And He said to him: 'So numerous will your descendants be.'

(Genesis 15:6) 
Abram believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

(Genesis 15:7) 
Then God said to him: 'I am the Lord, Who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land so that you may possess it.'

(Genesis 15:8) 
But Abram said: 'Lord God, how can I know that I will possess it?'

(Genesis 15:9) 
And the Lord responded, saying: 'Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, also a turtledove, and a young pigeon.'

(Genesis 15:10) 
So Abram brought all these to God. He cut the animals in half down the middle and laid each half opposite the other half. But he did not cut the birds in half.

(Genesis 15:11) 
Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.

(Genesis 15:12) 
As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great, dreadful darkness enveloped him.

(Genesis 15:13) 
And it was said to him: 'Know for certain that your descendants will be foreigners in a land not their own. They will be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years.'

(Genesis 15:14) 
'Nevertheless, I will judge the nation whom they will serve. And after this, they will come out with great possessions.'

(Genesis 15:15) 
'But you yourself will go to your ancestors in peace, buried in a good old age.'

(Genesis 15:16) 
'And in the fourth generation, they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete enough for them to be dispossessed.'

(Genesis 15:17) 
So when the sun had set, and it was very dark, behold, a smoking brazier and a flaming torch appeared, passing between the halves of the divided animals.

(Genesis 15:18) 
On that very day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'To your descendants I will give this land, from the river of Egypt all the way to the great river Euphrates—'

(Genesis 15:19) 
'—including the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,'

(Genesis 15:20) 
'—and the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,'

(Genesis 15:21) 
'—and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.'

(Genesis 16:1) 
Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne him any children. Now, she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.

(Genesis 17:1) 
It came to pass that when Abraham was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said to him: “I am God Almighty. Walk and live your life in My presence, and strive for perfection.”

(Genesis 17:2) 
I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply your descendants beyond measure.

(Genesis 17:3) 
Abram fell down, prostrate on his face, and God continued to speak to him, saying:

(Genesis 17:4) 
“I am He, and this is My covenant with you: you will be the father of many nations.”

(Genesis 17:5) 
“Your name will no longer be called Abram. Instead, your name will be Abraham, because I have made you the father of many nations.”

(Genesis 17:6) 
“I will make you incredibly fruitful, and I will make you into many nations, and kings will come forth from you.”

(Genesis 17:7) 
“And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and your descendants after you, throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant: that I may be your God, and the God of your descendants after you, forever.”

(Genesis 17:8) 
“And I will give to you and your descendants the land where you now live as an alien—all the land of Canaan—as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.”

(Genesis 17:9) 
God also said to Abraham: “You, therefore, shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.”

(Genesis 17:10) 
“This is My covenant, which you shall observe, between Me and you, and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.”

(Genesis 17:11) 
“You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be a visible sign of the covenant between Me and you.”

(Genesis 17:12) 
“Every male among you, in your generations, shall be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those bought with money, who are not of your direct lineage.”

(Genesis 17:13) 
“Both those born in your household and those bought with money must be circumcised. My covenant will be visibly marked in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.”

(Genesis 17:14) 
“Any uncircumcised male, whose foreskin has not been circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has broken My covenant and rendered it null and void.”

(Genesis 17:15) 
God also said to Abraham: “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai; rather, her name shall be Sarah.”

(Genesis 17:16) 
“I will bless her, and indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will become the mother of nations, and kings of peoples will be born from her.”

(Genesis 17:17) 
Abraham fell on his face and laughed within his heart, saying to himself: “Will a son indeed be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, actually give birth?”

(Genesis 17:18) 
And Abraham said to God: “Oh, that Ishmael might live and thrive in Your presence!”

(Genesis 17:19) 
Then God said: “No, truly, Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant, and with his descendants after him.”

(Genesis 17:20) 
“And concerning Ishmael, I have also heard your prayer. Behold, I will bless him, and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.”

(Genesis 17:21) 
“But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time, in the coming year.”

(Genesis 17:22) 
When God had finished speaking with Abraham, He then ascended from him.

(Genesis 17:23) 
So Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all those born in his household, and all those whom he had bought—every male among the men of his household—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins immediately on that very day, just as God had commanded him.

(Genesis 17:24) 
Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.

(Genesis 17:25) 
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.

(Genesis 17:26) 
On that very same day, Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son with him.

(Genesis 17:27) 
And all the men of his household—both those born in his house, and those bought with money, and even foreigners living among them—were circumcised with him at the same time.

(Genesis 18:1) 
The Lord then appeared to him in the valley of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent during the hottest part of the day.

(Genesis 18:2) 
And when he lifted his eyes, three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran from the door of his tent to meet them, and bowed down to the ground.

(Genesis 18:3) 
And he said: "My Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant."

(Genesis 18:4) 
Let me bring a little water, and you may wash your feet and then rest yourselves under this tree.

(Genesis 18:5) 
And I will bring a piece of bread, so you can refresh yourselves. After that, you may continue on your way, because that is why you have turned aside to your servant." And they said: "Do as you have spoken."

(Genesis 18:6) 
Abraham hurried to his tent to Sarah, and said to her: "Quickly, take three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make flat bread."

(Genesis 18:7) 
And he himself ran to the herd and took from there a very tender and choice calf, and gave it to a young man, who quickly prepared and cooked it.

(Genesis 18:8) 
He also brought butter and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set them before them. But he himself stood by them under the tree.

(Genesis 18:9) 
And when they had eaten, they said to him: "Where is Sarah your wife?" He responded: "Behold, she is in the tent."

(Genesis 18:10) 
And one of them said to him: "I will surely return to you at this time next year, if life continues as it is, and your wife Sarah will have a son." When Sarah heard this, she laughed to herself behind the door of the tent.

(Genesis 18:11) 
Now both Abraham and Sarah were old and advanced in age, and Sarah had ceased to have the monthly custom of women.

(Genesis 18:12) 
So Sarah laughed to herself, saying: "After I have become old, and my master is also old, shall I indeed have pleasure, or bear a child?"

(Genesis 18:13) 
And the Lord said to Abraham: "Why did Sarah laugh, saying: 'Shall I truly bear a child, being an old woman?'"

(Genesis 18:14) 
Is anything too difficult for God? I will return at the same time next year, if life continues as it is, and Sarah will have a son.

(Genesis 18:15) 
Sarah denied it, saying: "I did not laugh," because she was terrified. The Lord said: "It is not so; but you did laugh."

(Genesis 18:16) 
Then, when the men rose from there, they looked toward Sodom. And Abraham walked with them, accompanying them on their way.

(Genesis 18:17) 
And the Lord said: "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?"

(Genesis 18:18) 
For Abraham will surely become a great and very powerful nation, and in him, all the nations of the earth will be blessed.

(Genesis 18:19) 
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord and to do righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham everything He has spoken to him.

(Genesis 18:20) 
Therefore, the Lord said: "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah has greatly increased, and their sin has become exceedingly grievous."

(Genesis 18:21) 
I will go down and see if they have indeed carried out the full measure of the outcry that has come to me, or if it is not so; so that I may know with certainty.

(Genesis 18:22) 
So the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom. But Abraham still stood before the Lord.

(Genesis 18:23) 
And Abraham approached and said: "Will you truly destroy the righteous along with the wicked?"

(Genesis 18:24) 
If there are perhaps fifty righteous people in the city, will you destroy them? And will you not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who are in it?

(Genesis 18:25) 
Far be it from you to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous are treated like the wicked. Far be it from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?

(Genesis 18:26) 
And the Lord said: "If I find fifty righteous people in Sodom within the city, I will spare the entire place for their sake."

(Genesis 18:27) 
And Abraham responded and said: "Behold, I have dared to speak to my Lord, though I am but dust and ashes."

(Genesis 18:28) 
What if there are five fewer than fifty righteous people? Will you destroy the entire city because of those five?" And He said: "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."

(Genesis 18:29) 
And he spoke to Him again: "What if forty righteous people are found there?" He said: "I will not strike it for the sake of the forty."

(Genesis 18:30) 
Then he said: "Please, Lord, do not be angry if I speak again: what if thirty righteous people are found there?" He answered: "I will not do it if I find thirty there."

(Genesis 18:31) 
And he said: "Since I have begun, I will speak to my Lord again: what if twenty righteous people are found there?" He said: "I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty."

(Genesis 18:32) 
Then he said: "I beg you, Lord, do not be angry if I speak just one more time: what if ten righteous people are found there?" He answered: "I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten."

(Genesis 18:33) 
And the Lord departed after He had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his own place.

(Genesis 19:1) 
Two angels arrived in the city of Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting at the city gate, where people conducted legal and civic matters. When he saw them, he stood up and went out to meet them, bowing down with his face to the ground as a sign of deep respect and humility.

(Genesis 19:2) 
And Lot said, 'Please, sirs, come to your servant's house and stay the night there. You can wash your feet, and then depart on your journey in the morning.' But they replied, 'No, we will stay in the public square.'

(Genesis 19:3) 
But Lot urged them strongly, so they turned aside and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them, baking unleavened bread, and they ate.

(Genesis 19:4) 
Before they lay down to sleep, the men of the city of Sodom surrounded the house—every single person, from the youngest boy to the oldest man.

(Genesis 19:5) 
They called out to Lot and said to him, 'Where are the men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them intimately in a sinful way.'

(Genesis 19:6) 
Lot went out to them, closing the door behind him, and said,

(Genesis 19:7) 
'Please, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.'

(Genesis 19:8) 
'Look, I have two virgin daughters. I will bring them out to you, and you may do to them whatever you please. But do nothing to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.'

(Genesis 19:9) 
But they shouted back, 'Stand back!' And again they said, 'You came here as a foreigner, and now you want to judge us? We will treat you worse than we will treat them!' And they pressed violently against Lot, and were already close to breaking down the door.

(Genesis 19:10) 
Then the men inside (the angels) stretched out their hands, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door.

(Genesis 19:11) 
And they struck the men outside with blindness, from the youngest to the oldest, so that they could not find the door anymore.

(Genesis 19:12) 
Then the angels said to Lot, 'Do you have anyone else here who belongs to you? Your son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and everyone else who is yours—bring them out of this city.'

(Genesis 19:13) 
'For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before the Lord, who has sent us to destroy them.'

(Genesis 19:14) 
So Lot went out and spoke to his future sons-in-law, who were going to marry his daughters. He said, 'Get up, get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy this city.' But he seemed to them to be joking.

(Genesis 19:15) 
When the dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot, saying, 'Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you, so that you do not perish along with the city in its wickedness.'

(Genesis 19:16) 
When Lot hesitated, the angels grasped his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters, because the Lord had mercy on him. They led him out and placed him outside the city.

(Genesis 19:17) 
When they had led them outside, one of the angels said, 'Escape for your life! Do not look back behind you, and do not stop anywhere in the surrounding plain. Escape to the mountains, so that you do not perish along with everyone else!'

(Genesis 19:18) 
And Lot said to them, 'Oh no, my Lord, please do not make me do that!'

(Genesis 19:19) 
'Look, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown great mercy to me by saving my life. But I cannot escape to the mountains, for fear that some evil might overtake me there, and I will die.'

(Genesis 19:20) 
'See, there is this nearby town to which I can flee, and it is a small one. Please, let me escape there so that my life may be saved, for it is indeed a very small town.'

(Genesis 19:21) 
And the angel said to him, 'See, I have granted your request in this matter as well, that I will not overthrow the town for which you have pleaded.'

(Genesis 19:22) 
'Hurry and escape there, because I can do nothing until you arrive there.' That is why the name of that city was called Zoar, meaning 'small.'

(Genesis 19:23) 
The sun had risen over the earth when Lot entered Zoar.

(Genesis 19:24) 
Then the Lord rained down sulfur and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord, out of the sky.

(Genesis 19:25) 
And He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding plain, along with all the inhabitants of the cities, and every living thing growing on the ground.

(Genesis 19:26) 
But Lot's wife looked back behind him, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.

(Genesis 19:27) 
But Abraham, rising early in the morning, went to the place where he had previously stood before the Lord.

(Genesis 19:28) 
And he looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and across the entire land of that region. He saw smoke ascending from the earth, like the smoke from a furnace.

(Genesis 19:29) 
When God overthrew the cities of that region, He remembered Abraham, and rescued Lot from the destruction of the cities where he had lived.

(Genesis 19:30) 
Then Lot went up out of Zoar and settled in the mountains, with his two daughters, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He lived in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.

(Genesis 19:31) 
And the older daughter said to the younger, 'Our father is old, and there is no man left in this land to come in to us according to the custom of all the earth, to take us as wives and have children with us.'

(Genesis 19:32) 
'Come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father.'

(Genesis 19:33) 
So they gave their father wine to drink that night. Then the older daughter went in and lay with her father, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.

(Genesis 19:34) 
The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, 'See, I lay with my father last night. Let us make him drunk with wine tonight as well, and you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father.'

(Genesis 19:35) 
So they gave their father wine to drink that night also. And the younger daughter went in and lay with him, but he also did not know when she lay down or when she got up.

(Genesis 19:36) 
Thus, Lot's two daughters conceived children by their father.

(Genesis 19:37) 
The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of the Moabites to this very day.

(Genesis 19:38) 
The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi, which means 'son of my people.' He is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this very day.

(Genesis 20:1) 
Abraham then departed from that place and journeyed into the land to the south. He settled between Kadesh and Shur, and then lived for a time as a foreign visitor in Gerar.

(Genesis 20:2) 
He said about Sarah, his wife, 'She is my sister.' So Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her for himself.

(Genesis 20:3) 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him, 'Indeed, you will certainly die because of the woman you have taken, for she is already married to another man.'

(Genesis 20:4) 
But Abimelech had not had relations with her, and he said, 'Lord, will You destroy an innocent and righteous people?'

(Genesis 20:5) 
Did he not himself tell me, 'She is my sister,' and did she herself not say, 'He is my brother'? I did this with a sincere heart and clean hands, believing them.

(Genesis 20:6) 
And God said to him, 'Yes, I also know that you acted with a sincere heart, and therefore I prevented you from committing this sin against Me. I did not permit you to have relations with her.'

(Genesis 20:7) 
Now, therefore, restore the man's wife — Abraham's wife — because he is a prophet of God, and he will intercede for you, and your life will be spared. But if you are unwilling to return her, know that you yourself will certainly die, along with everyone and everything belonging to you.

(Genesis 20:8) 
Immediately, Abimelech got up in the night and called all his servants. He related everything that had been said to them, and all the people became very fearful.

(Genesis 20:9) 
Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, 'What is this that you have done to us? What offense have we committed against you that you would bring such a great sin upon me and my kingdom? You have done deeds to us that should never have been done.'

(Genesis 20:10) 
And Abimelech said to Abraham, 'What possible reason did you have for doing this?'

(Genesis 20:11) 
Abraham answered, 'I was afraid, thinking to myself, 'Perhaps there is no reverence for God in this place, and they would kill me to take my wife.''

(Genesis 20:12) 
Moreover, she is truly my sister; she is my father's daughter, though not my mother's, and I married her.

(Genesis 20:13) 
When God called me to leave my father's house, I said to her, 'Do this favor for me: in every place we go, you must say, 'He is my brother.''

(Genesis 20:14) 
So Abimelech took flocks and herds, male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he gave back Sarah, his wife, to him.

(Genesis 20:15) 
And Abimelech said, 'Look, my land is at your disposal; live wherever you wish.'

(Genesis 20:16) 
And to Sarah he also said, 'Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. Let this be a public vindication for you among all who witnessed this, and wherever you go, let it be a reminder of what happened.'

(Genesis 20:17) 
So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants so that they were able to conceive children.

(Genesis 20:18) 
For the Lord had indeed sealed every womb in Abimelech's household because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

(Genesis 21:1) 
The Lord had remembered Sarah, just as He promised. And He brought to pass everything He had spoken.

(Genesis 21:2) 
And she conceived and gave birth to a son in her old age, at the very time God had predicted to her.

(Genesis 21:3) 
And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac.

(Genesis 21:4) 
And he circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, just as God had commanded him.

(Genesis 21:5) 
Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

(Genesis 21:6) 
And Sarah said, "God has given me a reason to laugh! Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."

(Genesis 21:7) 
And again she said, "Who would have believed Abraham when he said that Sarah would nurse a child, and that she would give birth to him in her old age?"

(Genesis 21:8) 
So the boy grew, and he was weaned from his mother's milk. And Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.

(Genesis 21:9) 
But when Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian woman, making fun of Isaac her son,

(Genesis 21:10) 
she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave-woman and her son, for the son of this slave-woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac."

(Genesis 21:11) 
This matter seemed very difficult to Abraham because it involved his son.

(Genesis 21:12) 
But God said to him, "Do not let this seem harsh to you concerning the boy and your slave-woman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac your lineage will be called forth."

(Genesis 21:13) 
But I will also make the son of the slave-woman into a great nation, because he is your descendant too.

(Genesis 21:14) 
So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and put them on her shoulder, and he sent the boy with her. Then he sent her away. And when she had gone, she wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

(Genesis 21:15) 
And when the water in the bottle was used up, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.

(Genesis 21:16) 
Then she went and sat down opposite him, as far away as an arrow can be shot. For she said, "I will not see the boy die." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted her voice and wept.

(Genesis 21:17) 
Now God heard the voice of the boy. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the sky, saying, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from the place where he is."

(Genesis 21:18) 
Rise, take the boy, and hold his hand, for I will make him into a great nation.

(Genesis 21:19) 
Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of living water. So she went and filled the bottle and gave the boy to drink.

(Genesis 21:20) 
And God was with him, and he grew, and he lived in the wilderness, becoming a young archer.

(Genesis 21:21) 
And he lived in the desert of Paran, and his mother found him a wife from the land of Egypt.

(Genesis 21:22) 
At that same time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do."

(Genesis 21:23) 
Therefore, swear to me now by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my descendants, nor with my lineage. But according to the kindness I have shown to you, you will show kindness to me and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.

(Genesis 21:24) 
And Abraham said, "I will swear."

(Genesis 21:25) 
Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.

(Genesis 21:26) 
And Abimelech answered, "I do not know who did this. You did not tell me anything, and I did not hear of it until today."

(Genesis 21:27) 
So Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. And both of them made a covenant.

(Genesis 21:28) 
And Abraham set aside seven ewe-lambs from the flock.

(Genesis 21:29) 
And Abimelech said to him, "What do these seven ewe-lambs mean, which you have set aside?"

(Genesis 21:30) 
And he said, "You shall accept these seven ewe-lambs from my hand, that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well."

(Genesis 21:31) 
Because of this reason, that place was called Beersheba, which means 'well of the oath', because there both of them swore an oath.

(Genesis 21:32) 
So they made a covenant in Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.

(Genesis 21:33) 
And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.

(Genesis 21:34) 
And he sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.

(Genesis 22:1) 
After these things had happened, God put Abraham to the test. God said to him, 'Abraham! Abraham!' Abraham answered, 'Here I am.'

(Genesis 22:2) 
God said, 'Take your son, your only son, Isaac—the son whom you love—and go to the land of vision. There, offer him as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that I will show you.'

(Genesis 22:3) 
So, Abraham got up before dawn and saddled his donkey. He took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. Abraham cut the wood for the burnt offering and then set off for the place God had told him about.

(Genesis 22:4) 
On the third day of their journey, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.

(Genesis 22:5) 
Abraham told his servants, 'You two stay here with the donkey. My son and I will go up to the mountain to worship, and then we will come back to you.' —This implies Abraham's faith that Isaac would be returned to him.

(Genesis 22:6) 
Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon his son Isaac’s shoulders. Abraham himself carried the fire and the knife in his hands. And so, the two of them walked on together.

(Genesis 22:7) 
Isaac spoke to his father Abraham, saying, 'My father!' Abraham answered, 'What is it, my son?' Isaac said, 'Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?'

(Genesis 22:8) 
Abraham replied, 'My son, God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering.' And so, the two of them walked on together.

(Genesis 22:9) 
When they arrived at the place God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there. He arranged the wood upon it. Then, Abraham bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.

(Genesis 22:10) 
Abraham then reached out his hand and took the knife, ready to sacrifice his son.

(Genesis 22:11) 
But behold, an angel of the Lord called to him from the sky, saying, 'Abraham! Abraham!' Abraham answered, 'Here I am!'

(Genesis 22:12) 
The angel said, 'Do not lay a hand on the boy, and do not do anything to him! Now I know that you truly revere God, for you did not withhold your only son from Me.'

(Genesis 22:13) 
Abraham looked up and saw a ram behind him, caught by its horns in a thicket. So Abraham took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

(Genesis 22:14) 
Abraham called the name of that place, 'The Lord Will Provide.' —Using the prophetic sense of 'sees'. That is why, to this day, people say, 'On the mountain, the Lord will provide.'

(Genesis 22:15) 
Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the sky,

(Genesis 22:16) 
saying, 'By Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord. Because you have done this and have not withheld your only son—'

(Genesis 22:17) 
'—I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants as countless as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.'

(Genesis 22:18) 
'Through your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.'

(Genesis 22:19) 
Then Abraham returned to his servants, and together they went to Beersheba. And Abraham settled there.

(Genesis 22:20) 
After these events, Abraham received a message, saying, 'Listen! Your brother Nahor’s wife, Milcah, has also given birth to sons!'

(Genesis 22:21) 
These are their names: Huz, his firstborn, Buz, his brother, and Kemuel, who became the father of the Aramean people.

(Genesis 22:22) 
Also Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. It was from Bethuel that Rebekah was born.

(Genesis 22:23) 
These eight sons Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.

(Genesis 22:24) 
His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore children: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

(Genesis 23:1) 
And Sarah lived for one hundred and twenty-seven years.

(Genesis 23:2) 
And she died in the city of Arbee, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan. So Abraham came to mourn and to weep for her.

(Genesis 23:3) 
After Abraham had finished with his duties concerning the deceased, he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying:

(Genesis 23:4) 
“I am a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Grant me a place to bury my dead among you, so that I can bury my deceased wife.”

(Genesis 23:5) 
And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying:

(Genesis 23:6) 
“Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty leader sent by God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our burial places. No one among us will refuse you from burying your dead in his own burial place.”

(Genesis 23:7) 
Abraham then stood up and bowed down respectfully before the people of the land, that is, the sons of Heth.

(Genesis 23:8) 
And he spoke to them, saying, “If you are truly willing for me to bury my dead, then hear me and intercede for me with Ephron, the son of Zohar.”

(Genesis 23:9) 
“Tell him to give me the double-chambered cave that he owns at the far end of his field. He must sell it to me for its full price in silver, in your presence, so that I may possess it as a burial place.”

(Genesis 23:10) 
Now Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth. And Ephron answered Abraham in the hearing of all those who were entering the gate of his city, saying:

(Genesis 23:11) 
“By no means, my lord! I give you the field itself, and the cave which is in it, freely to you. In the presence of the sons of my people, you may bury your dead.”

(Genesis 23:12) 
Abraham then bowed down before the people of the land.

(Genesis 23:13) 
And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “I beg you, hear me! I will give you money for the field. Accept it from me, and so I may bury my dead there with you.”

(Genesis 23:14) 
And Ephron answered him:

(Genesis 23:15) 
“My lord, hear me. The land is valued at one hundred talents of silver. What is that amount between you and me? Just bury your dead.”

(Genesis 23:16) 
When Abraham heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had demanded: one hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard public weight.

(Genesis 23:17) 
And so, Ephron's field, which contained the double-chambered cave facing Mamre, was legally transferred. Both the field itself, the cave, and all the trees within its boundaries, were legally confirmed.

(Genesis 23:18) 
It was transferred to Abraham as a permanent possession, witnessed by the sons of Heth and all who entered the gate of that city.

(Genesis 23:19) 
And so Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the double-chambered cave of the field that faced Mamre, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

(Genesis 23:20) 
And the field, along with the cave within it, was legally confirmed to Abraham by the sons of Heth as a permanent burial possession.

(Genesis 24:1) 
Abraham was now very old and had lived many years, and the Lord had blessed him in everything he did and possessed.

(Genesis 24:2) 
He said to his senior servant, the one in charge of his entire household, and who managed all of Abraham's possessions:

(Genesis 24:3) 
He said to him, 'Swear an oath by the Lord, the God of the universe and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I now live.

(Genesis 24:4) 
Instead, you must go to my own country and to my own relatives, and there you will find a wife for my son, Isaac.'

(Genesis 24:5) 
The servant replied, 'But what if the woman is unwilling to follow me back to this land? Must I then take your son back to the land you came from?'

(Genesis 24:6) 
Abraham responded, 'Under no circumstances are you to take my son back there!'

(Genesis 24:7) 
The Lord, the God of the universe, who took me from my father's house and from the land where I was born—He is the one who spoke to me and swore an oath, saying: 'I will give this land to your descendants.'

(Genesis 24:8) 
He himself will send His angel ahead of you, and you will successfully find a wife there for my son.

(Genesis 24:9) 
However, if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you will be released from this oath. Just do not take my son back to that place.'

(Genesis 24:10) 
So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his master, and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.

(Genesis 24:11) 
Then the servant took ten camels from his master's herd and brought with him a selection of his master's finest goods. He then set out for Mesopotamia, traveling toward the city of Nahor.

(Genesis 24:12) 
When he had finished praying, he said: 'Lord, God of my master Abraham, I beg you, grant me success today, and show covenant faithfulness to my master Abraham.'

(Genesis 24:13) 
'Look, I am standing here beside this well of water, and the daughters of the city's inhabitants will soon come out to draw water.'

(Genesis 24:14) 
'May it be that the young woman to whom I say, "Please lower your jar so I can drink," and who then replies, "Drink, and I will also water your camels"—that she is the one you have prepared for your servant Isaac. By this sign, I will know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.'

(Genesis 24:15) 
He had barely finished speaking when, behold, Rebekah appeared. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother. She carried a water jar on her shoulder.

(Genesis 24:16) 
The young woman was exceptionally beautiful, a pure virgin, and no man had ever been with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and then started to come back up.

(Genesis 24:17) 
The servant hurried to meet her and said: 'Please, let me drink a little water from your jar.'

(Genesis 24:18) 
She immediately replied, 'Drink, my lord.' She quickly lowered her jar to her arm and gave him a drink.

(Genesis 24:19) 
After he had finished drinking, she said: 'I will also draw water for your camels until they have all had enough to drink.'

(Genesis 24:20) 
So she quickly emptied her jar into the watering trough, and then ran back to the well to draw more water, and she continued drawing for all his camels.

(Genesis 24:21) 
The man watched her in silence, wanting to know if the Lord had truly made his journey successful, or not.

(Genesis 24:22) 
After the camels had finished drinking, the man took out two gold nose rings, together weighing two shekels, and two gold bracelets, weighing ten shekels.

(Genesis 24:23) 
Then he asked her, 'Whose daughter are you? Please tell me: Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?'

(Genesis 24:24) 
She answered, 'I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.'

(Genesis 24:25) 
She added, saying: 'We have plenty of straw and fodder, and also space for you to spend the night.'

(Genesis 24:26) 
The man bowed his head and worshipped the Lord,

(Genesis 24:27) 
saying: 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His covenant faithfulness and His truth from my master. He has led me directly to the house of my master's brother!'

(Genesis 24:28) 
So the young woman ran off and reported everything she had heard in her mother's household.

(Genesis 24:29) 
Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he quickly rushed out to the man at the spring.

(Genesis 24:30) 
When he saw the nose rings and bracelets on his sister's hands, and heard all the words she recounted, he came to the man who was still standing by the camels, near the water spring.

(Genesis 24:31) 
And he said, 'Come in, blessed of the Lord! Why are you standing outside? I have prepared the house, and a place for your camels.'

(Genesis 24:32) 
So Laban brought the man into the house. He then unloaded the camels, gave straw and fodder to the camels, and provided water for washing his feet and the feet of the men who had come with him.

(Genesis 24:33) 
When food was set before him, he said, 'I will not eat until I have spoken my message.' Laban replied to him, 'Speak.'

(Genesis 24:34) 
Then he said, 'I am Abraham's servant.'

(Genesis 24:35) 
And the Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become very prosperous. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.

(Genesis 24:36) 
And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master, even after she was already old. My master has given everything he owns to that son.

(Genesis 24:37) 
My master made me swear an oath, saying: 'You must not choose a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I am living;'

(Genesis 24:38) 
'but you are to go to my father's house, and choose a wife for my son from among my relatives.'

(Genesis 24:39) 
And I said to my master, 'What if the woman is unwilling to come with me?'

(Genesis 24:40) 
He replied, 'The Lord, in whose presence I live and walk, will send His angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you will find a wife for my son from my own relatives and from my father's household.'

(Genesis 25:1) 
Abraham, for his part, married again, and took a wife named Keturah.

(Genesis 25:2) 
She bore for him Zamran, Jecsan, Madan, Madian, Jesboc, and Sue.

(Genesis 25:3) 
Jecsan, for his part, begot Saba and Dadan. The sons of Dadan were Rassum, Lugum, and Lemin.

(Genesis 25:4) 
Furthermore, the sons of Madian were Epha, Opher, Henoch, Abida, and Eldaa. All these were descendants through Keturah.

(Genesis 25:5) 
And Abraham gave all that he possessed to Isaac.

(Genesis 25:6) 
But to the sons of his concubines, he gave gifts, and he separated them from Isaac, his son, while he was still living, sending them toward the eastern region.

(Genesis 25:7) 
Now the days of Abraham's life, which he lived, were one hundred seventy-five years.

(Genesis 25:8) 
And being fully aged, he died in a good old age, full of days, and was gathered to his people.

(Genesis 25:9) 
And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is situated opposite Mamre, in the field of Ephron, the son of Seor the Hethite.

(Genesis 25:10) 
Abraham had purchased this cave from the sons of Heth: there he was buried, and Sarah his wife.

(Genesis 25:11) 
And after his death, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac then lived near the Well of Vision.

(Genesis 25:12) 
These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.

(Genesis 25:13) 
And these are the names of Ishmael's sons, according to their names and their generations: Ishmael’s firstborn was Nabajoth, then Cedar, Adbeel, Masma,

(Genesis 25:14) 
and Massa, and Iduma, and Massa (this is a repeated name or variant spelling in the text),

(Genesis 25:15) 
and Badad, and Thema, and Jetur, and Naphis, and Cedma.

(Genesis 25:16) 
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their towns and their encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.

(Genesis 25:17) 
And the years of Ishmael’s life were one hundred thirty-seven. He then weakened, died, and was gathered to his people.

(Genesis 25:18) 
From Havila to Hemath, as far as one comes to Sur, which faces Egypt as one journeys towards the Assyrians—he died in the presence of all his brethren.

(Genesis 25:19) 
These also are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac.

(Genesis 25:20) 
When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebecca, the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian from Mesopotamia, the sister of Laban the Syrian.

(Genesis 25:21) 
Isaac then implored the Lord for his wife, because she was barren. The Lord heard him, and Rebecca, his wife, conceived.

(Genesis 25:22) 
But the children struggled violently within her womb. She said, “If this is how it will be for me, why was it necessary to conceive?” And she went to consult the Lord.

(Genesis 25:23) 
And the Lord responded: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be divided from your body. One people will overcome the other people, and the older will serve the younger.”

(Genesis 25:24) 
When the time for her to give birth arrived, behold, there were twins in her womb.

(Genesis 25:25) 
The first one who came out was reddish, and entirely hairy like a cloak. And his name was called Esau.

(Genesis 25:26) 
After him came his brother, whose hand grasped Esau’s heel. And therefore, his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born to him.

(Genesis 25:27) 
Now the boys grew up. Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field. Jacob, however, was a simple man, dwelling in tents.

(Genesis 25:28) 
Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his game. And Rebecca loved Jacob.

(Genesis 25:29) 
Now Jacob cooked a stew. And when Esau came in from the field, weary,

(Genesis 25:30) 
he said, “Give me some of that red dish, for I am extremely famished.” For this reason, his name was called Edom (meaning 'red').

(Genesis 25:31) 
To him Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright first.”

(Genesis 25:32) 
He replied, “Look, I am about to die. What good will a birthright be to me?”

(Genesis 25:33) 
And Jacob said, “Swear to me then.” Esau swore, and sold his birthright to Jacob.

(Genesis 25:34) 
And so, Jacob gave him bread and the lentil stew. Esau ate, and drank, and rose up, and went away, showing little regard for having sold his birthright.

(Genesis 25:35) 
Now a famine occurred in the land, following the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar.

(Genesis 25:36) 
And the Lord appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt, but remain in the land which I will tell you about.

(Genesis 25:37) 
Journey as a stranger in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all these regions, fulfilling the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.

(Genesis 25:38) 
And I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the sky. And I will give all these regions to your descendants. And all the nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring,

(Genesis 25:39) 
because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My precepts and My commandments, and observed My ceremonies and rituals.”

(Genesis 25:40) 
So Isaac remained in Gerar.

(Genesis 26:1) 
Now there was a famine in the land—a new one, after the previous famine that had happened during the time of Abraham. And so Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar.

(Genesis 26:2) 
And the Lord appeared to Isaac, saying: 'Do not go down to Egypt; instead, stay in the land that I will show you.'

(Genesis 26:3) 
Live as a temporary resident in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you. For to you and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, fulfilling the oath that I swore to Abraham, your father.

(Genesis 26:4) 
And I will multiply your descendants, making them as numerous as the stars of the sky. And I will give all these lands to your descendants. And through your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed,

(Genesis 26:5) 
because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My commands and My ordinances, and observed My ceremonies and rituals.

(Genesis 26:6) 
So Isaac remained in Gerar.

(Genesis 26:7) 
When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, 'She is my sister.' For he was afraid to admit that she was his wife by marriage, thinking that they might kill him because of her great beauty.

(Genesis 26:8) 
After many days had passed, and while he was living there, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked out through a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebecca, his wife.

(Genesis 26:9) 
And calling Isaac, he said to him: 'It is clear that she is your wife. Why did you lie, saying she was your sister?' Isaac replied, 'I was afraid that I might die because of her.'

(Genesis 26:10) 
And Abimelech said: 'What is this that you have done to us? Any one of my people could have slept with your wife, and you would have brought great guilt upon us.'

(Genesis 26:11) 
And he commanded all his people, saying: 'Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.'

(Genesis 26:12) 
Now Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that same year, he harvested a hundredfold. And the Lord blessed him abundantly.

(Genesis 26:13) 
And the man became great, and he continued to prosper and grow, until he became very wealthy and powerful.

(Genesis 26:14) 
For he possessed many flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and a large household of servants. Therefore, the Philistines envied him.

(Genesis 26:15) 
All the wells that the servants of his father, Abraham, had dug, Abimelech had stopped up by filling them with earth.

(Genesis 26:16) 
Finally, he warned Isaac himself to leave his territory, saying: 'Go away from us, for you have become much too powerful for us.'

(Genesis 26:17) 
So Isaac moved away from there, and after setting up his tents in the valley of Gerar, he lived there.

(Genesis 26:18) 
He again dug out the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death. And he called them by the same names that his father had called them before.

(Genesis 26:19) 
And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and they found a well of flowing water.

(Genesis 26:20) 
But even there, the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, 'The water is ours!' Therefore, he named that well 'Quarrel', because they had disputed with him there.

(Genesis 26:21) 
They also dug another well, and they quarreled over that one as well. So he named it 'Enmity'.

(Genesis 26:22) 
Moving on from there, he dug another well, and for this one, there was no contention. Therefore, he named it 'Broad Places', saying: 'Now the Lord has made room for us, and given us a spacious place, so that we may flourish and increase in the land.'

(Genesis 26:23) 
From that place, he went up to Beersheba.

(Genesis 26:24) 
And the Lord appeared to him on that very night, saying: 'I am the God of Abraham, your father. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of Abraham, My servant.'

(Genesis 26:25) 
So he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord. Then he pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.

(Genesis 26:26) 
And Abimelech came to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzath, his friend, and Phicol, the commander of his army.

(Genesis 26:27) 
And Isaac said to them: 'Why have you come to me, a man whom you hated, and whom you drove away from among you?'

(Genesis 26:28) 
They replied: 'We clearly saw that the Lord is with you, and therefore we said to ourselves: "Let there now be an oath between us and you, and let us make a covenant together," – an agreement of peace.'

(Genesis 26:29) 
'that you will do us no harm, just as we intended no harm against you. Instead, we sent you away in peace, because you were greatly blessed by the Lord.'

(Genesis 26:30) 
So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.

(Genesis 26:31) 
And rising early in the morning, they swore an oath to one another. Then Isaac sent them away, and they returned to their own land.

(Genesis 26:32) 
On that very same day, Isaac's servants came to tell him about the well they had dug, saying, 'We have found water!'

(Genesis 26:33) 
And he called it 'Abundance'. Therefore, the city was called Beersheba from that name, even to this present day.

(Genesis 26:34) 
Now when Esau was forty years old, he took wives: Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.

(Genesis 26:35) 
Both of whom caused bitterness and sorrow to the spirit of Isaac and Rebecca.

(Genesis 27:1) 
Now it came to pass, when Isaac had become old and his eyes had grown so dim that he could no longer see, he called Esau, his firstborn son, and said to him: 'My son.'

(Genesis 27:2) 
Esau answered: 'Here I am.' Isaac then said: 'Look, I am now an old man, and I do not know the day of my death.'

(Genesis 27:3) 
Therefore, take your hunting weapons—your quiver and your bow—and go out into the field. When you catch something by hunting,

(Genesis 27:4) 
make me a stew from it, just as you know I like it, and bring it to me, so I may eat. After that, my soul will bless you before I die.

(Genesis 27:5) 
Rebecca, however, had overheard when Isaac spoke to Esau, his son. So when Esau had gone out into the field to hunt and bring back what he had caught,

(Genesis 27:6) 
Rebecca said to Jacob, her son: 'I heard your father speaking with your brother Esau, saying:'

(Genesis 27:7) 
'Bring me some of your game, and make me a meal so I may eat it, and then I will bless you before the Lord before I die.'

(Genesis 27:8) 
'Now therefore, my son, listen to my counsel, which I am commanding you to follow.'

(Genesis 27:9) 
'Go to the flock and bring me two of the best young goats, so I may prepare a meal from them for your father, the kind he enjoys eating.'

(Genesis 27:10) 
'When you bring them in and he eats them, he will bless you before he dies.'

(Genesis 27:11) 
Jacob answered her: 'You know my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin.'

(Genesis 27:12) 
'If my father touches me and feels my skin, I am afraid he will think I am trying to deceive him, and then I will bring a curse upon myself instead of a blessing.'

(Genesis 27:13) 
His mother said to him: 'Upon me be that curse, my son. Only listen to my voice and go and bring what I have told you.'

(Genesis 27:14) 
So he went and brought them and gave them to his mother. She then prepared the food, just as she knew his father liked it.

(Genesis 27:15) 
Then she dressed Jacob in Esau's best clothes, which she kept with her in the house. She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the skins of the young goats.

(Genesis 27:16) 
She said to him: 'Bring this to your father, so that when he eats, he may bless you.'

(Genesis 27:17) 
So he brought it to his father. When Isaac had eaten, he said: 'Who are you, my son?'

(Genesis 27:18) 
Jacob answered: 'I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you commanded me. Rise up, sit down, and eat of my game, so that your soul may bless me.'

(Genesis 27:19) 
Isaac said: 'How is it, my son, that you were able to find it so quickly?'

(Genesis 27:20) 
Jacob answered: 'It was God's will that what I sought quickly came before me.'

(Genesis 27:21) 
Isaac said: 'Come closer here, so that I may touch you, my son, and determine whether you are truly Esau or not.'

(Genesis 27:22) 
Jacob came closer to his father. Isaac, having felt him, said: 'The voice, indeed, is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.'

(Genesis 27:23) 
And he did not recognize him, because his hairy hands resembled those of his elder son Esau. So Isaac blessed him.

(Genesis 27:24) 
And he said: 'Are you truly my son Esau?'

(Genesis 27:25) 
Jacob answered: 'I am.' Then Isaac said: 'Bring it to me, so I may eat of your game, my son, and my soul may bless you.'

(Genesis 27:26) 
When Jacob brought it and Isaac had eaten, Isaac then brought out wine. After he had drunk it,

(Genesis 27:27) 
he said to Jacob: 'Come near me and kiss me, my son.'

(Genesis 27:28) 
Jacob came near and kissed him. As soon as Isaac smelled the fragrance of his garments, he blessed him and said: 'Look, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field full of crops, a field which the Lord has blessed.'

(Genesis 27:29) 
'May God give you of the dew of the sky and of the richness of the earth, an abundance of grain and of new wine.'

(Genesis 27:30) 
'May peoples serve you, and tribes bow down before you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down before you.'

(Genesis 27:31) 
'Whoever curses you, let him be cursed; and whoever blesses you, let him be filled with blessings.'

(Genesis 27:32) 
Scarcely had Isaac finished speaking these words, and Jacob had just gone out, when Esau arrived, returning from his hunt.

(Genesis 27:33) 
After preparing a fine meal, he brought it to his father, saying: 'Arise, my father, and eat of your son's game, so that your soul may bless me.'

(Genesis 27:34) 
Isaac was utterly terrified, and amazed beyond belief, saying: 'Who then was it who just now brought me game, and I ate everything before you came? And I blessed him — and he will remain blessed.'

(Genesis 27:35) 
When Esau heard his father's words, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry, and said: 'Bless me too, my father!'

(Genesis 27:36) 
But Isaac said: 'Your brother came deceitfully and took away your blessing.'

(Genesis 27:37) 
Esau answered: 'He is rightly named Jacob, for he has now supplanted me a second time. First he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing too!' And again he said to his father: 'Have you not reserved a blessing for me as well?'

(Genesis 27:38) 
Isaac answered: 'I have made him your master, and all his brothers I have subjected to his service. I have sustained him with grain and wine. And for you, my son, what more can I do?'

(Genesis 27:39) 
Esau said to him: 'Have you only one blessing, father? Please, bless me also.' And as he wailed and wept,

(Genesis 27:40) 
Isaac was moved and said to him: 'Behold, your blessing shall be from the richness of the earth and from the dew of the sky above.'

(Genesis 28:1) 
So Isaac called Jacob, and he gave Jacob his blessing. Then Isaac gave Jacob a command, saying: "Do not take a wife from the people of Canaan."

(Genesis 28:2) 
Instead, go and journey to Mesopotamia in Syria, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father. From there, take a wife for yourself from among the daughters of Laban, your uncle.

(Genesis 28:3) 
And may Almighty God bless you, cause you to grow, and make you fruitful, so that you may become a vast assembly of peoples.

(Genesis 28:4) 
And may He give you the blessings that Abraham received, and to your descendants after you. This is so you may possess the land where you are a sojourner—the land He promised to your grandfather, Abraham.

(Genesis 28:5) 
So after Isaac had sent Jacob away, Jacob went to Mesopotamia in Syria, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, who was the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's mother.

(Genesis 28:6) 
Now Esau saw that his father had blessed Jacob and sent him to Mesopotamia in Syria to get a wife from there. He also heard that after the blessing, Isaac had commanded Jacob, saying: "Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."

(Genesis 28:7) 
Esau also saw that Jacob had obeyed his parents and had gone to Mesopotamia in Syria.

(Genesis 28:8) 
So Esau understood that the daughters of Canaan were not pleasing to his father, Isaac.

(Genesis 28:9) 
Therefore, Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, and the sister of Nebaioth, as a wife in addition to the wives he already had.

(Genesis 28:10) 
So Jacob set out from Beersheba and traveled towards Haran.

(Genesis 28:11) 
When he came to a certain place where he intended to spend the night because the sun had set, he took one of the stones lying there, placed it under his head, and lay down to sleep in that same spot.

(Genesis 28:12) 
Then he had a dream: he saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to the universe itself, where God dwells beyond the created cosmos. He also saw the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

(Genesis 28:13) 
And behold, the Lord was standing above the ladder, saying to him: "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which you are sleeping, I will give to you and to your descendants."

(Genesis 28:14) 
Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants.

(Genesis 28:15) 
And behold, I will be your protector wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have fulfilled everything I have spoken to you.

(Genesis 28:16) 
When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said: "Surely the Lord is present in this place, and I did not know it."

(Genesis 28:17) 
He was afraid and said: "How awesome is this place! This is nothing less than the house of God, and the gateway to the spiritual realm, beyond the created sky."

(Genesis 28:18) 
So Jacob rose early in the morning, took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a monument, and poured oil on top of it.

(Genesis 28:19) 
And he called the name of that place Beth-el, which was formerly called Luz.

(Genesis 28:20) 
Jacob also made a solemn vow, saying: "If God will be with me and protect me on the journey I am taking, and give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,

(Genesis 28:21) 
and if I return safely to my father’s house, then the Lord will truly be my God."

(Genesis 28:22) 
"And this stone, which I have set up as a monument, will be a house of God. Of all the things you give me, I will faithfully return a tenth to you."

(Genesis 29:1) 
So Jacob continued on his journey and arrived in the land of the eastern peoples. There, he saw a well in a field with three flocks of sheep resting beside it. The shepherds used this well to water their flocks, and its opening was covered by a large stone.

(Genesis 29:2) 
For it was from this well that the shepherds usually watered their animals. But they would only roll the stone away from the well's opening once all the flocks were gathered together, and after watering them, they would put the stone back in its place.

(Genesis 29:3) 
Jacob then asked them, "Brothers, where are you from?" They answered, "We are from Haran."

(Genesis 29:4) 
He then asked them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?" They replied, "We know him."

(Genesis 29:5) 
Jacob asked, "Is he doing well?" They answered, "He is well, and look, his daughter Rachel is coming now with her flock."

(Genesis 29:6) 
Jacob said to the shepherds, "It is still bright daylight, and it's not yet time to bring the animals back to their pens for the night. You should water the sheep and then take them back to the pastures."

(Genesis 29:7) 
But the shepherds replied, "We cannot do that until all the flocks have gathered, and we all together roll the stone away from the opening of the well so we can water the animals."

(Genesis 29:8) 
While Jacob was still speaking, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess and cared for the flock herself.

(Genesis 29:9) 
When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban—his mother's brother—and Laban's sheep, he immediately went up to the well. He single-handedly rolled away the stone from the opening and watered Laban's entire flock.

(Genesis 29:10) 
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and, overcome with emotion, he began to weep loudly.

(Genesis 29:11) 
He told her that he was a relative of her father, and that he was Rebekah's son. Rachel then ran quickly to tell her father this news.

(Genesis 29:12) 
When Laban heard the news about Jacob, he immediately ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him, then brought him to his house. Jacob recounted everything that had happened during his journey.

(Genesis 29:13) 
After hearing everything, Laban said, "You are truly my own flesh and blood." So Jacob stayed with Laban for a full month.

(Genesis 29:14) 
After that month, Laban said to him, "Just because you are my relative, should you work for me for free? Tell me, what wages do you expect to receive?"

(Genesis 29:15) 
Now, Laban had two daughters. The older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel.

(Genesis 29:16) 
Leah's eyes were weak, or perhaps not as striking, but Rachel was beautiful in form and had a lovely appearance.

(Genesis 29:17) 
Jacob loved Rachel deeply, so he said to Laban, "I will serve you for seven years in exchange for your younger daughter, Rachel."

(Genesis 29:18) 
Laban answered, "It is better that I give her to you than to another man. So stay here with me."

(Genesis 29:19) 
So Jacob served Laban for seven years for Rachel. Because of the great love he had for her, those seven years seemed to him like only a few days.

(Genesis 29:20) 
Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for the time of my service is completed, and I wish to be with her as my wife."

(Genesis 29:21) 
Laban then gathered all the men of that place and held a wedding feast.

(Genesis 29:22) 
But in the evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her, believing she was Rachel.

(Genesis 29:23) 
When morning came, Jacob realized that it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What have you done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me like this?"

(Genesis 29:24) 
Laban answered, "It is not the custom in our country to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one."

(Genesis 29:25) 
Laban continued, "Complete the week of celebration for this marriage, and then I will also give you Rachel, but in return, you must serve me for another seven years."

(Genesis 29:26) 
Jacob agreed to this arrangement. After he had completed the week for Leah's wedding, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.

(Genesis 29:27) 
And Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.

(Genesis 29:28) 
So Jacob also went in to Rachel as his wife, and he loved Rachel much more deeply than Leah. He then served Laban for another seven years as agreed.

(Genesis 29:29) 
Now, the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, or at least less loved than Rachel. So God enabled her to conceive children, while Rachel remained unable to bear children.

(Genesis 29:30) 
Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben, saying, "The Lord has seen my humiliation. Now, surely my husband will love me."

(Genesis 29:31) 
She conceived again and bore a second son, and she named him Simeon, explaining, "Because the Lord heard that I was unloved, He has given me this son."

(Genesis 29:32) 
She conceived a third time and bore another son, and she said, "Now this time, my husband will surely be joined to me in affection, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore, she named him Levi.

(Genesis 29:33) 
She conceived again and bore a fourth son, and she said, "This time I will praise the Lord." Therefore, she named him Judah. After this, she stopped bearing children for a time.

(Genesis 30:1) 
Seeing that Rachel was barren and had not given birth, she became jealous of her sister, Leah. So she said to Jacob, 'Give me children, or else I will die!'

(Genesis 30:2) 
Jacob became angry with Rachel and answered her directly. He said, 'Am I in the place of God, who has made you unable to bear children?'

(Genesis 30:3) 
Rachel said to him, 'Look, here is my maidservant, Bilhah. Go to her and have relations with her. Let her give birth to a child that I can claim as my own, so that I may have children through her.'

(Genesis 30:4) 
So Rachel gave Jacob her maidservant, Bilhah, as a concubine. Jacob then had relations with her.

(Genesis 30:5) 
Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son.

(Genesis 30:6) 
Rachel said, 'God has judged my cause fairly, and He has heard my voice by giving me a son.' For this reason, she named the child Dan, which means 'judge'.

(Genesis 30:7) 
Bilhah conceived again and gave birth to a second son.

(Genesis 30:8) 
Rachel then declared, 'I have wrestled with my sister in a mighty struggle from God, and I have overcome her.' So she named him Naphtali, meaning 'my wrestling'.

(Genesis 30:9) 
When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took her maidservant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a concubine.

(Genesis 30:10) 
When Zilpah had relations with Jacob, she conceived and gave birth to a son.

(Genesis 30:11) 
Leah exclaimed, 'What good fortune has come!' For this reason, she named him Gad, meaning 'fortune' or 'troop'.

(Genesis 30:12) 
Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, also gave birth to a second son.

(Genesis 30:13) 
And Leah said, 'How happy I am! Women will now call me blessed!' For this reason, she named him Asher, meaning 'happy' or 'blessed'.

(Genesis 30:14) 
One day, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the field and found mandrakes. He brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, 'Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.'

(Genesis 30:15) 
Leah answered her, 'Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes too?' Rachel then said, 'Very well, Jacob will sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.'

(Genesis 30:16) 
When Jacob returned from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him. She told him, 'You are to come to me tonight, because I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.' So he slept with her that night.

(Genesis 30:17) 
God listened to Leah’s prayers, and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son.

(Genesis 30:18) 
Leah declared, 'God has given me my reward, because I gave my maidservant to my husband.' So she named him Issachar, meaning 'reward'.

(Genesis 30:19) 
Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son.

(Genesis 30:20) 
She said, 'God has provided me with a good dowry. Now my husband will honor me, because I have given him six sons.' So she named him Zebulun.

(Genesis 30:21) 
After this, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.

(Genesis 30:22) 
Then the Lord remembered Rachel. He listened to her prayers and opened her womb.

(Genesis 30:23) 
She conceived and gave birth to a son, saying, 'God has taken away my disgrace of barrenness.'

(Genesis 30:24) 
She named him Joseph, meaning 'may He add,' saying, 'May the Lord add another son to me.'

(Genesis 30:25) 
After Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban, 'Let me go, so that I may return to my own land and my homeland.'

(Genesis 30:26) 
'Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, so that I may leave. You know well how I have served you.'

(Genesis 30:27) 
Laban replied to him, 'If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.'

(Genesis 30:28) 
Then Laban said, 'Name your wages for me, and I will pay them.'

(Genesis 30:29) 
Jacob answered, 'You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared under my care.'

(Genesis 30:30) 
'For the little you had when I arrived has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I went. Now, when will I be able to provide for my own household as well?'

(Genesis 30:31) 
Laban then asked, 'What shall I give you?' Jacob replied, 'You don't need to give me anything upfront. But if you will agree to what I am asking, I will again tend and keep your flocks.'

(Genesis 30:32) 
'Today I will go through all your flocks and separate every speckled and spotted animal, and every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and every spotted and speckled goat among the goats. These will be my wages.'

(Genesis 30:33) 
'My honesty will be evident for me tomorrow, when you come to inspect my wages in your presence. Any animal that is not speckled or spotted, or any sheep that is not dark-colored, if found among my animals, will be considered stolen.'

(Genesis 30:34) 
Laban replied, 'Very well! Let it be as you have said, and I will gladly do it.'

(Genesis 30:35) 
However, that same day, Laban secretly separated all the male goats that were striped or spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled or spotted, and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep. He put them in the care of his sons.

(Genesis 30:36) 
Then he put a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.

(Genesis 30:37) 
But Jacob took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees. He then peeled strips of bark from them, exposing the white wood underneath, while other parts remained dark.

(Genesis 30:38) 
He placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. The animals would look at the striped branches when they came to drink, and they would conceive while looking at them.

(Genesis 30:39) 
As a result, the flocks conceived in front of the branches and gave birth to offspring that were striped, speckled, and spotted.

(Genesis 30:40) 
Jacob then separated the flocks and made sure that all of Laban’s dark-colored and spotted animals faced the striped branches in the troughs. He thus caused all of Laban’s flocks to become striped, speckled, and spotted.

(Genesis 31:1) 
Jacob heard Laban's sons saying that Jacob had taken everything that belonged to their father, and from what was their father's, Jacob had made himself all these riches.

(Genesis 31:2) 
Jacob also noticed Laban's demeanor, and it was not favorable toward him, as it had been on previous days.

(Genesis 31:3) 
And the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to your ancestral land, to your family, and I will be with you."

(Genesis 31:4) 
So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah, calling them to the field where his flocks were grazing.

(Genesis 31:5) 
He said to them, "I see that your father's disposition towards me is no longer what it was in previous days. Yet, the God of my father has remained with me."

(Genesis 31:6) 
And you both know that I have served your father with all my strength.

(Genesis 31:7) 
But your father has repeatedly cheated me, changing my wages ten times; yet God did not allow him to cause me any harm.

(Genesis 31:8) 
If ever he declared, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the sheep would bear speckled young. But if he said, 'The striped ones,' then all the flocks would bear striped young.

(Genesis 31:9) 
In this way, God has taken away your father's flocks and given them to me.

(Genesis 31:10) 
For when the sheep were conceiving, I lifted my eyes in a dream and saw that the male goats mounting the ewes were speckled, striped, and mottled.

(Genesis 31:11) 
And in that dream, the angel of God called to me, "Jacob!" And I answered, "Here I am."

(Genesis 31:12) 
He said, "Look up and see all the male goats mounting the ewes are speckled, mottled, and striped. I have observed everything Laban has done to you."

(Genesis 31:13) 
"I am the God of Bethel, where you consecrated a stone pillar and made a solemn vow to me. Now, arise and leave this land, and return to the land where you were born."

(Genesis 31:14) 
Rachel and Leah responded, "Do we have any remaining share or inheritance in our father's household?"

(Genesis 31:15) 
"Did he not treat us as strangers, sell us into marriage, and then spend all the money that was due to us?"

(Genesis 31:16) 
"All the wealth and possessions that God has taken from our father now belong to us and our children. Therefore, do everything God has commanded you."

(Genesis 31:17) 
So Jacob prepared to depart. He put his children and wives on camels and set out.

(Genesis 31:18) 
He made haste to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan, taking with him all his possessions, all his flocks, and everything he had acquired in Mesopotamia.

(Genesis 31:19) 
Meanwhile, Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel secretly took her father's household idols.

(Genesis 31:20) 
Jacob kept his departure a secret from Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he was fleeing.

(Genesis 31:21) 
After he and all he possessed had departed and crossed the river, Jacob set his course toward Mount Gilead.

(Genesis 31:22) 
On the third day, Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.

(Genesis 31:23) 
So Laban took his kinsmen with him and pursued Jacob for seven days, finally overtaking him on Mount Gilead.

(Genesis 31:24) 
That night, Laban saw the Lord in a dream, who said to him, "Be careful not to speak anything harsh or threatening to Jacob."

(Genesis 31:25) 
Jacob had already pitched his tent on the mountain. When Laban arrived with his companions, they also pitched their tents on the same Mount Gilead.

(Genesis 31:26) 
Laban then said to Jacob, "Why have you done this? Why did you secretly lead away my daughters as if they were captives taken by the sword?"

(Genesis 31:27) 
"Why did you not tell me, so that I could have sent you off with joy and songs, accompanied by tambourines and harps?"

(Genesis 31:28) 
"You did not even allow my daughters and their children to kiss their father goodbye. You have acted foolishly and thoughtlessly."

(Genesis 31:29) 
"I have the power to do you great harm. But the God of your father said to me yesterday, 'Be careful not to speak anything harsh or threatening to Jacob.'"

(Genesis 31:30) 
"Alright, granted, you left because of your longing for home and your distress. But why did you steal my household gods?"

(Genesis 31:31) 
Jacob replied, "Because I was afraid that you might forcefully take your daughters away from me."

(Genesis 31:32) 
"If you find your gods with anyone here, that person shall die. In the presence of our kinsmen, examine whatever you find among my belongings and take it." Jacob said this, unaware that Rachel had stolen them.

(Genesis 31:33) 
So Laban went into Jacob's tent, then Leah's tent, and then the tents of both maidservants, but he found nothing. When he entered Rachel's tent,

(Genesis 31:34) 
Rachel, quickly, had hidden the idols under the camel's saddle on which she was sitting. And after he had searched all parts of the tent and found nothing,

(Genesis 31:35) 
she said, "Do not be angry, my lord, that I cannot rise in your presence, for I am experiencing a woman's customary condition." In this way, she deceived her father, and he did not find what he was looking for.

(Genesis 31:36) 
Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. He said, "What is my offense? What is my sin that you have pursued me so fiercely?"

(Genesis 31:37) 
"After you have thoroughly searched through all my possessions, what have you found here that belongs to your household? Place it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, and let them judge between us."

(Genesis 31:38) 
"I have been with you for twenty years. Your ewes and female goats were never barren, and I never ate the rams from your flock."

(Genesis 31:39) 
"I never showed you an animal torn by wild beasts; I always bore the burden of such loss myself. Whatever was stolen, you demanded compensation from me."

(Genesis 31:40) 
"By day, I was tormented by the scorching heat, and by night, by the bitter frost. Sleep often fled from my eyes."

(Genesis 32:1) 
Jacob continued on his journey. Angels of God met him along the way.

(Genesis 32:2) 
When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's camp!" So he named that place Mahanaim—meaning "Two Camps".

(Genesis 32:3) 
Jacob then sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, before he arrived.

(Genesis 32:4) 
He gave them this instruction: "Tell my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says this: "I have lived as a foreigner with Laban and stayed there until today."

(Genesis 32:5) 
" 'I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and both male and female servants. I am sending this message to my lord now, so that I may find favor in your sight.' "

(Genesis 32:6) 
The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We went to your brother Esau, and look, he is coming to meet you, and he has four hundred men with him."

(Genesis 32:7) 
Jacob was extremely frightened. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two separate groups.

(Genesis 32:8) 
He said, "If Esau attacks one group and destroys it, then at least the other remaining group will be saved."

(Genesis 32:9) 
Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, You told me, 'Return to your land and to the place of your birth, and I will be good to you.'"

(Genesis 32:10) 
"I am unworthy of all the acts of mercy and the faithfulness You have shown to your servant. I crossed this Jordan River with nothing but my staff, and now I am returning with these two large groups of people and animals."

(Genesis 32:11) 
"Please, rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, because I am very afraid of him. I fear that he may come and attack me, slaughtering both mothers and children alike."

(Genesis 32:12) 
"You Yourself promised that You would do good to me and multiply my descendants like the sand of the sea, which is so numerous it cannot be counted."

(Genesis 32:13) 
That night, after he had settled down to sleep, Jacob took some of his possessions to be a gift for his brother Esau.

(Genesis 32:14) 
The gift consisted of two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

(Genesis 32:15) 
thirty female camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys with ten of their young.

(Genesis 32:16) 
He gave these animals to his servants, dividing them into separate groups. He then instructed his servants, "Go on ahead of me, and leave a clear space between each group of animals."

(Genesis 32:17) 
He commanded the first servant, saying, "If my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Whose servant are you? Where are you going? And to whom do these animals belong that you are driving?'"

(Genesis 32:18) 
"You are to answer, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and Jacob himself is coming right behind us.'"

(Genesis 32:19) 
He gave the same instructions to the second servant, and to the third, and to all those who followed with the animal groups, saying, "Speak these exact same words to Esau when you encounter him."

(Genesis 32:20) 
"And be sure to add, 'Your servant Jacob is also coming right behind us.' " Jacob thought to himself, "I will appease him with these gifts that are going ahead of me. After that, when I see his face directly, perhaps he will receive me kindly and be reconciled with me."

(Genesis 32:21) 
So the gifts went ahead of him, and Jacob spent that night in the camp.

(Genesis 32:22) 
That very night, Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River.

(Genesis 32:23) 
After he had sent them across the river, he sent over all his possessions as well.

(Genesis 32:24) 
Jacob remained alone on the other side. Then, a man wrestled with him until dawn.

(Genesis 32:25) 
When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched Jacob’s hip socket, and immediately Jacob's hip was dislocated as they wrestled.

(Genesis 32:26) 
The man said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."

(Genesis 32:27) 
The man then asked him, "What is your name?" He answered, "Jacob."

(Genesis 32:28) 
The man said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and have overcome." This new name signifies "He struggles with God" or "God strives."

(Genesis 32:29) 
Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But the man replied, "Why do you ask for my name?" And He blessed Jacob right there in that place.

(Genesis 32:30) 
Jacob named that place Penuel—meaning "Face of God"—saying, "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved."

(Genesis 32:31) 
The sun rose upon him just as he was passing Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.

(Genesis 32:32) 
For this reason, to this very day, the children of Israel do not eat the sinew that is on the hip socket—the one that had shrunk in Jacob's thigh—because the man had touched the sinew of Jacob's hip, and it had shrunken.

(Genesis 33:1) 
Jacob looked up, and there was Esau approaching. With Esau were four hundred men, which was cause for Jacob's immediate alarm.

(Genesis 33:2) 
Jacob then divided his children among Leah and Rachel, and also among their two servant women, arranging them for protection.

(Genesis 33:3) 
He placed the two servant women and their children at the very front of the procession; Leah and her children were placed behind them; and Rachel and Joseph, his most beloved, were placed last, in the safest position.

(Genesis 33:4) 
But Jacob himself went ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times in extreme submission, doing so until his brother Esau came close to him.

(Genesis 33:5) 
Then Esau ran to meet his brother. He embraced him, put his arms around his neck, and kissed him, and they both wept.

(Genesis 33:6) 
Esau looked up and saw the women and children. He asked Jacob, "Who are these with you?" Jacob replied, "These are the children that God has graciously given to your servant."

(Genesis 33:7) 
Then the servant women and their children came forward, and they all bowed down to Esau.

(Genesis 33:8) 
Next, Leah and her children came forward, and they likewise bowed down. Finally, Rachel and Joseph came forward and bowed down to Esau.

(Genesis 33:9) 
Esau then asked, "What do you mean by all these droves and herds that I met on the way?" Jacob replied, "I hope to find favor in your sight, my lord."

(Genesis 33:10) 
Esau said to him, "I have enough, my brother. Keep what is yours. I am well-provided for."

(Genesis 33:11) 
Jacob replied, "No, I beg you, if I have truly found favor in your eyes, then please accept this gift from my hand. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me graciously."

(Genesis 33:12) 
Please accept the blessing, this gift that I have brought for you, because God has been gracious to me and has given me everything I need and more." So Jacob urged him, and Esau took the gift.

(Genesis 33:13) 
Jacob kept urging him, and Esau finally accepted it.

(Genesis 33:14) 
Esau then said, "Let's set out and go. I will go along with you to Seir."

(Genesis 33:15) 
Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds nursing their young are a burden to me. If I drive them too hard for even one day, all the animals will die."

(Genesis 33:16) 
So please, my lord, go on ahead of your servant. I will follow slowly, at the pace of the livestock and the children, until I come to you in Seir."

(Genesis 33:17) 
Esau said, "Let me at least leave some of my people with you to help on the journey." But Jacob replied, "What need is there for that, my lord? I am content with your kindness and protection for all these things."

(Genesis 33:18) 
So Esau turned back that day and went his way toward Seir.

(Genesis 33:19) 
Meanwhile, Jacob journeyed to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and made temporary shelters for his livestock. Therefore, he called the place Succoth, which means 'Shelters' or 'Booths'.

(Genesis 33:20) 
Jacob then traveled safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, after returning from Paddan-aram in Syria. He camped near the city.

(Genesis 33:21) 
There, he bought a plot of land where he had pitched his tents from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money, or 'qesitas' in the ancient currency.

(Genesis 33:22) 
He erected an altar there and called it El-Elohe-Israel, which means 'God, the God of Israel the Most Powerful'.

(Genesis 34:1) 
Dina, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of that land.

(Genesis 34:2) 
When Shechem saw her, he was the son of Hamor the Hivite, and ruler of that land. He desired her strongly, seized her, and then violently raped her.

(Genesis 34:3) 
Afterward, his affections became fixed on Dina, Jacob’s daughter. He loved the girl and spoke to her with words meant to soothe her heart.

(Genesis 34:4) 
So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, 'Get this girl for me as a wife.'

(Genesis 34:5) 
Jacob, however, heard the news that his daughter Dina had been violently disgraced. His sons were out in the fields tending the sheep at the time. So he remained silent, waiting for them to come home.

(Genesis 34:6) 
Then Hamor, Shechem's father, came out to Jacob to speak with him about the matter.

(Genesis 34:7) 
When Jacob’s sons returned from the field, they heard what had been done. They were deeply enraged by the despicable act committed against Dina and the family’s honor in Israel, which was an intolerable crime.

(Genesis 34:8) 
Then Hamor spoke to them, saying, 'My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. Please, give her to him in marriage. Let us form a bond of kinship between our families.'

(Genesis 34:9) 
'Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves as wives. Then you can live among us.'

(Genesis 34:10) 
'The land is at your disposal. You may cultivate it, engage in trade, and acquire property within it.'

(Genesis 34:11) 
Shechem then said to Dina's father and brothers, 'Grant me this favor, please. Whatever you ask of me, I will give you.'

(Genesis 34:12) 
'Demand as great a bride-price and gifts as you wish. I will gladly provide whatever you determine, as long as you give me the girl to be my wife.'

(Genesis 34:13) 
Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, speaking out of anger and a desire for vengeance, because Shechem had defiled their sister Dina.

(Genesis 34:14) 
They told them, 'We cannot do this, nor can we give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.'

(Genesis 34:15) 
'We will only form an alliance and friendship with you on this condition: if you are willing to become like us, and every male among you is circumcised.'

(Genesis 34:16) 
'Then we will both take your daughters as wives and give our daughters to you. We will live among you, and we will become one people.'

(Genesis 34:17) 
'But if you men refuse to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter back and leave your land.'

(Genesis 34:18) 
Their words seemed good to Hamor and to his son Shechem.

(Genesis 34:19) 
The young man Shechem did not delay, but immediately did what had been commanded. He loved the girl very much, and he was the most respected and honored in all his father's house.

(Genesis 34:20) 
Then Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the people there.

(Genesis 34:21) 
'These men are peaceful toward us and wish to settle in our land. Let them conduct business and cultivate the land; it is spacious and vast enough for everyone. There is no reason why we should not take their daughters as wives and give our daughters to them.'

(Genesis 34:22) 
'There is only one condition by which this friendship and alliance can be established: if all our males are circumcised, just as they themselves are circumcised.'

(Genesis 34:23) 
'Their wealth, their livestock, and all their possessions will become ours. We only agree to this condition, and then we will live together with them as one people.'

(Genesis 34:24) 
All the men who came out of the city gate agreed to their proposal, and every male among them was circumcised.

(Genesis 34:25) 
Now on the third day, when the pain from their wounds was most intense, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dina's full brothers, each took his sword. They entered the city boldly and killed all the males.

(Genesis 34:26) 
They also killed Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dina from Shechem's house and departed.

(Genesis 34:27) 
The other sons of Jacob rushed upon the slain and plundered the city as an act of vengeance for the rape of their sister.

(Genesis 34:28) 
They took all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, as well as everything that was in the city and in the fields.

(Genesis 34:29) 
They carried away all the young children and the women as captives, and they plundered everything else.

(Genesis 34:30) 
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have brought trouble upon me and made me odious to the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the inhabitants of this land. My numbers are few compared to theirs. If they gather together and attack me, both I and my entire household will be destroyed.'

(Genesis 34:31) 
But they answered, 'Should our sister have been treated like a harlot?'

(Genesis 35:1) 
God also said to Jacob: 'Get up and go up to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, the One who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.'

(Genesis 35:2) 
Jacob then spoke to his household and all his people, saying: 'Cast away the foreign gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments to symbolize your purification.'

(Genesis 35:3) 
'Then get up, and let us go up to Bethel, so we can make an altar there to God. He heard me on the day of my trouble and has been a companion on my journey.'

(Genesis 35:4) 
So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods they had, and the earrings that were in their ears – items often associated with pagan practices or amulets. Jacob buried these beneath the terebinth tree near the city of Shechem.

(Genesis 35:5) 
When they had departed, the terror of the Lord gripped all the surrounding cities, and no one dared to pursue them.

(Genesis 35:6) 
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, and it was also known by the name Bethel. He and all his people were with him.

(Genesis 35:7) 
And he built an altar there, and he called the name of that place 'God of Bethel' – meaning that God truly dwelt there. For it was there that God had appeared to him when he was fleeing from his brother.

(Genesis 35:8) 
At that time, Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died and was buried under an oak tree at Bethel. The name of that place was then called 'Oak of Weeping,' marking a place of great sorrow for Jacob's family.

(Genesis 35:9) 
God appeared to Jacob again after he had returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and He blessed him.

(Genesis 35:10) 
God said: 'Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel will be your name.' And indeed, He called his name Israel.

(Genesis 35:11) 
And God said to him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. Both nations and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come forth from your body.'

(Genesis 35:12) 
'And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you and to your descendants after you.'

(Genesis 35:13) 
Then God departed from him in the very place where He had spoken with him.

(Genesis 35:14) 
Jacob then set up a stone pillar in the place where God had spoken with him, pouring a drink offering over it and anointing it with oil to consecrate the spot.

(Genesis 35:15) 
And he called the name of that very place, Bethel.

(Genesis 35:16) 
Having journeyed from Bethel, they came to the land of Ephrath. While there, Rachel was giving birth, and she experienced a very difficult labor.

(Genesis 35:17) 
After severe pains, the midwife said to her: 'Do not fear, you will also have this son.'

(Genesis 35:18) 
As her life was ebbing away, and she was already dying, she called his name Benoni, which means 'Son of my sorrow.' But his father called him Benjamin, meaning 'Son of the right hand,' to give him a name of blessing instead.

(Genesis 35:19) 
So Rachel died and was buried on the road to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.

(Genesis 35:20) 
Jacob set up a pillar over her grave. This pillar marks Rachel's monument even to the present day.

(Genesis 35:21) 
Journeying from there, Israel (Jacob) pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.

(Genesis 35:22) 
While Jacob was dwelling in that region, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father's concubine – a grave sin that deeply dishonored his father. This act did not escape Jacob's knowledge, and it would have serious consequences later. Now, the sons of Jacob were twelve in number.

(Genesis 35:23) 
The sons of Leah were: Reuben, the firstborn; and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.

(Genesis 35:24) 
The sons of Rachel were: Joseph, and Benjamin.

(Genesis 35:25) 
The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, were: Dan, and Naphtali.

(Genesis 35:26) 
The sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, were: Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria, in the land of Paddan-Aram.

(Genesis 35:27) 
And Jacob also came to his father Isaac at Mamre, the city of Arba – which is Hebron. This was the place where both Abraham and Isaac had lived as sojourners, continuing the patriarchs' journey of faith.

(Genesis 35:28) 
Isaac's life spanned one hundred and eighty years.

(Genesis 35:29) 
Worn out by old age and full of years, Isaac died and was gathered to his people – a phrase indicating his peaceful passing into the afterlife. He was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob, marking a moment of reconciliation for them.

(Genesis 36:1) 
This is the family line of Esau, who is also known as Edom.

(Genesis 36:2) 
Esau took his wives from among the daughters of Canaan: Ada, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Ana, who was the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite.

(Genesis 36:3) 
Also Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael, who was the sister of Nebaioth.

(Genesis 36:4) 
These were the sons born to Esau: Eliphaz was born from Ada, and Reuel from Basemath.

(Genesis 36:5) 
Also, from Oholibamah were born: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

(Genesis 36:6) 
Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the people of his household, along with all his possessions, his livestock, and everything he had acquired in the land of Canaan. And he went to another region, moving away from his brother Jacob.

(Genesis 36:7) 
Indeed, they were so wealthy that they could not live together in the same place. The land where they were staying as temporary residents could not support them both because of their many livestock.

(Genesis 36:8) 
So Esau settled in Mount Seir. He is also known as Edom, and this region became known by his name.

(Genesis 36:9) 
This is the family line of Esau, the ancestor of Edom, who lived in Mount Seir:

(Genesis 36:10) 
These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Ada, Esau's wife; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, Esau's wife.

(Genesis 36:11) 
The sons of Eliphaz were: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.

(Genesis 36:12) 
And Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to him. These were the descendants of Ada, Esau's wife.

(Genesis 36:13) 
The sons of Reuel were: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the descendants of Basemath, Esau's wife.

(Genesis 36:14) 
These also were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Ana, who was the daughter of Zibeon—Esau's wife: to whom she bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.

(Genesis 36:15) 
These are the chiefs (or tribal leaders) from the sons of Esau: from the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn: Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,

(Genesis 36:16) 
Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, Chief Amalek. These are the chiefs from Eliphaz in the land of Edom, and these are the descendants of Ada.

(Genesis 36:17) 
These also are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, Chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the descendants of Basemath, Esau's wife.

(Genesis 36:18) 
These also are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, Chief Korah. These are the chiefs from Oholibamah, the daughter of Ana, Esau's wife.

(Genesis 36:19) 
These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs. He is Edom, and these are his family lines.

(Genesis 36:20) 
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of that land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah,

(Genesis 36:21) 
and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs, the sons of Seir, in the land of Seir.

(Genesis 36:22) 
The sons of Lotan were: Hori and Hemam. And Lotan's sister was Timna (the one who became Eliphaz's concubine).

(Genesis 36:23) 
The sons of Shobal were also: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

(Genesis 36:24) 
The sons of Zibeon were also: Aiah and Anah. This is the same Anah who found hot springs in the desert while pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.

(Genesis 36:25) 
The children of Anah were: Dishon and Oholibamah, Anah's daughter (who became Esau's wife).

(Genesis 36:26) 
The sons of Dishon were: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.

(Genesis 36:27) 
The sons of Ezer were also: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.

(Genesis 36:28) 
The sons of Dishan were: Uz and Aran.

(Genesis 36:29) 
These are the Horite chiefs: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,

(Genesis 36:30) 
Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, Chief Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs who ruled in the land of Seir.

(Genesis 36:31) 
These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel.

(Genesis 36:32) 
Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. And the name of his city was Dinhabah.

(Genesis 36:33) 
When Bela died, Jobab, the son of Zerah, from Bozrah, reigned in his place.

(Genesis 36:34) 
When Jobab also died, Husham, from the land of the Temanites, reigned in his place.

(Genesis 36:35) 
When he also died, Hadad, the son of Bedad, reigned in his place. He was the one who defeated Midian in the region of Moab. And the name of his city was Avith.

(Genesis 36:36) 
When Hadad died, Samlah, from Masrekah, reigned in his place.

(Genesis 36:37) 
When he also died, Shaul, from Rehoboth on the River, reigned in his place.

(Genesis 36:38) 
When Shaul died, Baal-hanan, the son of Achbor, reigned in his place.

(Genesis 36:39) 
When he also died, Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau. His wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, who was the daughter of Me-zahab.

(Genesis 36:40) 
These are the names of the chiefs of Esau, listed according to their families, their places of dwelling, and their specific names: Chief Timna, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,

(Genesis 37:1) 
Jacob settled in the land of Canaan, which was the same land where his father had lived as a foreigner.

(Genesis 37:2) 
This is the family record of Jacob. Joseph was sixteen years old, and though still a boy, he was tending the flock with his brothers. He was working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, who were his father's wives. Joseph reported very serious misconduct about his brothers to his father.

(Genesis 37:3) 
Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his other sons, because Joseph had been born to him in his old age. So Jacob made for him a long, intricately designed tunic.

(Genesis 37:4) 
When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all of them, they hated him and could not speak a single peaceful word to him.

(Genesis 37:5) 
It happened that Joseph also had a dream, which he told his brothers about, and because of this, they hated him even more.

(Genesis 37:6) 
And he said to them: "Listen to this dream that I had."

(Genesis 37:7) 
"I imagined us tying up sheaves of grain in the field. And it was as if my sheaf rose up and stood upright, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."

(Genesis 37:8) 
His brothers replied: "Will you truly be our king? Or will you really rule over us?" Because of his dreams and his words, they hated him even more.

(Genesis 37:9) 
He also had another dream, which he told his father and his brothers, saying: "I dreamed that the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."

(Genesis 37:10) 
When he told this to his father and his brothers, his father scolded him and said: "What does this dream mean that you have seen? Will I and your mother and your brothers truly bow down to you on the earth?"

(Genesis 37:11) 
So his brothers envied him, but his father quietly considered the meaning of the matter.

(Genesis 37:12) 
Therefore, his brothers went to pasture their father's flocks in Shechem.

(Genesis 37:13) 
Then Israel said to Joseph: "Your brothers are pasturing the sheep in Shechem. Come, I will send you to them." And Joseph replied, "I am ready to go."

(Genesis 37:14) 
Jacob said: "Go, and see if all is well with your brothers and the sheep, and bring me back word of what is happening." So Joseph was sent from the valley of Hebron and came to Shechem.

(Genesis 37:15) 
And a man found him wandering in the field and asked him what he was looking for.

(Genesis 37:16) 
He replied: "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me where they are pasturing the flocks."

(Genesis 37:17) 
The man said to him: "They have moved on from this place. I heard them saying, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.

(Genesis 37:18) 
When they saw him from a distance, before he came near them, they plotted to kill him.

(Genesis 37:19) 
And they said to one another: "Look, here comes the dreamer."

(Genesis 37:20) 
"Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him into an old cistern. Then we can say, 'A terrible wild beast devoured him,' and we will see what good his dreams will do him."

(Genesis 37:21) 
But Reuben heard this and tried to rescue him from their hands, saying: "Let us not take his life."

(Genesis 37:22) 
"Do not shed his blood, but throw him into this cistern, which is in the wilderness, and keep your hands free of his blood." Reuben said this intending to rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father.

(Genesis 37:23) 
Therefore, when Joseph came to his brothers, they immediately stripped him of the tunic he was wearing, the intricately designed tunic.

(Genesis 37:24) 
And they threw him into the old cistern, which had no water in it.

(Genesis 37:25) 
And as they sat down to eat bread, they saw Ishmaelite travelers coming from Gilead, their camels carrying spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to Egypt.

(Genesis 37:26) 
Then Judah said to his brothers: "What benefit is it to us if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"

(Genesis 37:27) 
"It is better that he be sold to the Ishmaelites, so that our hands are not defiled by his blood. After all, he is our brother and our own flesh." His brothers agreed.

(Genesis 37:28) 
As Midianite merchants passed by, they pulled Joseph out of the cistern and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. These Ishmaelites then took him to Egypt.

(Genesis 37:29) 
When Reuben returned to the cistern and did not find the boy, he tore his clothes in anguish.

(Genesis 37:30) 
He reported to his brothers, saying: "The boy is gone! And I, where can I go now?"

(Genesis 37:31) 
Then they took Joseph's tunic and dipped it in the blood of a slaughtered goat.

(Genesis 37:32) 
They sent the tunic to their father with the message: "We found this. See if it is your son's tunic or not."

(Genesis 37:33) 
When he recognized it, he said: "It is my son's tunic! A terrible wild beast has eaten him; a beast has devoured Joseph."

(Genesis 37:34) 
And tearing his clothes, he mourned for his son for a very long time.

(Genesis 37:35) 
All his children gathered to comfort their father, but he refused to be comforted and said: "I will go down to my son, mourning, into the underworld of the dead." And he continued weeping.

(Genesis 37:36) 
Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, who was the commander of the royal guard.

(Genesis 38:1) 
At that time, Judah left his brothers. He turned aside and went to stay with a man from Adullam, whose name was Hirah.

(Genesis 38:2) 
There he saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shuah. He took her as his wife and then went in to her.

(Genesis 38:3) 
She conceived and bore a son, and Judah called his name Er.

(Genesis 38:4) 
Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.

(Genesis 38:5) 
She bore a third son, whom she named Shelah. Judah himself was in Canaan when Shelah was born.

(Genesis 38:6) 
Then Judah took a wife for his firstborn son, Er. Her name was Tamar.

(Genesis 38:7) 
But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death.

(Genesis 38:8) 
Therefore, Judah said to Onan: 'Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.'

(Genesis 38:9) 
But Onan knew that the offspring would not be considered his own. So, when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, so that he would not raise up offspring in his brother's name.

(Genesis 38:10) 
And for this reason, the Lord struck him down, because he did such a detestable thing.

(Genesis 38:11) 
Therefore, Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law: 'Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up.' Judah was actually thinking that Shelah also might die, just as his brothers had. So, Tamar went and remained in her father's house.

(Genesis 38:12) 
After many days, Shuah's daughter, Judah's wife, died. When the period of mourning was over, Judah went up to Timnah to his sheep shearers, along with his friend Hirah, the Adullamite, who was the shepherd of his flock.

(Genesis 38:13) 
And it was told to Tamar: 'Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.'

(Genesis 38:14) 
So, she took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, and disguised herself. Then she sat at the fork in the road that leads to Timnah, because she saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.

(Genesis 38:15) 
When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered her face.

(Genesis 38:16) 
He turned aside to her on the way and said: 'Let me come in to you,' not knowing that she was his daughter-in-law. She answered: 'What will you give me if you come in to me?'

(Genesis 38:17) 
He answered: 'I will send you a young goat from the flock.' She replied: 'Will you give me a pledge until you send it?'

(Genesis 38:18) 
Judah said: 'What pledge shall I give you?' She answered: 'Your signet ring, your bracelet, and your staff that is in your hand.' So he gave her what she asked, and went in to her. And she conceived by him.

(Genesis 38:19) 
As soon as he had departed, she rose and went away, and taking off her disguise, she put on her widow's garments again.

(Genesis 38:20) 
Then Judah sent the young goat by his friend Hirah, the Adullamite shepherd, so that he might retrieve the pledge from the woman. But Hirah could not find her.

(Genesis 38:21) 
He asked the men of that place: 'Where is the harlot who was sitting at the fork in the road?' They answered: 'There has been no harlot in this place.'

(Genesis 38:22) 
So, Hirah returned to Judah and said to him: 'I could not find her. Moreover, the men of that place told me that there had been no harlot sitting there.'

(Genesis 38:23) 
Judah said: 'Let her keep the items then, lest we become a laughingstock. I sent the young goat, and you could not find her.'

(Genesis 38:24) 
About three months later, it was told to Judah: 'Your daughter-in-law Tamar has committed harlotry, and behold, she is found to be with child.' Judah said: 'Bring her out, that she may be burned.'

(Genesis 38:25) 
As she was being led out to be executed, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 'By the man to whom these things belong, by him I am pregnant.' She added: 'Please recognize whose signet ring, bracelet, and staff these are.'

(Genesis 38:26) 
When Judah recognized them, he said: 'She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah.' And he did not lie with her again.

(Genesis 38:27) 
Now, at the time of her delivery, it was discovered that she had twins in her womb.

(Genesis 38:28) 
And as she was giving birth, one of the babies put out a hand. The midwife tied a scarlet thread on its hand, saying: 'This one will come out first.'

(Genesis 38:29) 
But he drew back his hand, and then his brother came out. And the midwife said: 'Why have you made a breach for yourself?' So, for this reason, his name was called Perez.

(Genesis 38:30) 
After him, his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread. And his name was called Zerah.

(Genesis 39:1) 
Joseph had been brought to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the royal guard—not necessarily a eunuch in the literal sense, but a high-ranking court official—bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.

(Genesis 39:2) 
The Lord was with Joseph, and he prospered in all that he did. He lived in the house of his Egyptian master.

(Genesis 39:3) 
Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph, and that God guided all of Joseph’s work to success.

(Genesis 39:4) 
Because of this, Joseph found favor with Potiphar and became his personal attendant. Potiphar placed Joseph in charge of his entire household and all his possessions.

(Genesis 39:5) 
From the moment Potiphar appointed Joseph over his house and over all that he owned, the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s household because of Joseph. The Lord’s blessing multiplied everything that belonged to Potiphar, both in his house and in his fields.

(Genesis 39:6) 
Potiphar no longer had to worry about anything, except the food he ate. Joseph was handsome in face and appearance.

(Genesis 39:7) 
After a long time, Potiphar’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."

(Genesis 39:8) 
But Joseph refused, and said to her, "Look, my master does not know what he has in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to me."

(Genesis 39:9) 
"No one in this house is greater than I am. He has not denied me anything except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against my God?"

(Genesis 39:10) 
She pressed him day after day, but he refused to agree. He would not even lie down with her or spend time with her anymore.

(Genesis 39:11) 
So one day Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were inside.

(Genesis 39:12) 
But she grabbed his cloak, saying, "Sleep with me!" Joseph left his cloak in her hand, fled, and ran outside.

(Genesis 39:13) 
When the woman saw that his cloak was in her hands and that he had run away,

(Genesis 39:14) 
she called her household servants and said to them, "Look! My husband brought this Hebrew man here to mock us. He came into my room, saying, 'Sleep with me!' And when I screamed,"

(Genesis 39:15) 
"and he heard my voice crying out, he left his cloak with me and ran outside."

(Genesis 39:16) 
So she laid his cloak beside her until her husband came home.

(Genesis 39:17) 
She spoke to him with the very same words, saying, "The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to mock me."

(Genesis 39:18) 
"And when he heard me crying out, he left his cloak with me and fled outside."

(Genesis 39:19) 
When Joseph’s master heard his wife’s words—especially hearing the exact same story she told him—he became very angry.

(Genesis 39:20) 
So he had Joseph thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were held. And there Joseph remained, shut away.

(Genesis 39:21) 
But the Lord was with Joseph, and He extended His mercy to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.

(Genesis 39:22) 
The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were held in custody. Whatever needed to be done there was done under Joseph’s supervision.

(Genesis 39:23) 
The warden did not carefully oversee anything that was entrusted to Joseph, because the Lord was with Joseph, and the Lord directed all his work.

(Genesis 39:24) 
After these events, it happened that two of Pharaoh’s officials, his chief cupbearer and his chief baker, offended their lord, the king of Egypt.

(Genesis 39:25) 
Pharaoh was angry with them both—the cupbearer and the baker—

(Genesis 39:26) 
and he put them in the prison of the captain of the royal guard, the very place where Joseph was imprisoned.

(Genesis 39:27) 
The captain of the royal guard assigned Joseph to serve them, and he did so.

(Genesis 39:28) 
So they remained in custody for a considerable time.

(Genesis 39:29) 
One night, both of them—the cupbearer and the baker—had a dream, each with its own specific meaning. Each man dreamed his own dream.

(Genesis 39:30) 
When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw that they were distressed,

(Genesis 39:31) 
he asked them, "Why are your faces sadder than usual today?"

(Genesis 39:32) 
They answered, "We had dreams, and there is no one here to interpret them for us."

(Genesis 39:33) 
Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please, tell me what you dreamed."

(Genesis 39:34) 
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said, "In my dream, I saw a vine."

(Genesis 39:35) 
"On the vine were three branches, which began to bud, then blossomed, and then ripened into clusters of grapes."

(Genesis 39:36) 
"I held Pharaoh’s cup in my hand. I took the grapes, pressed them into the cup I was holding, and then handed the cup to Pharaoh."

(Genesis 39:37) 
Joseph answered, saying, "This is the interpretation of your dream: The three branches represent three days."

(Genesis 39:38) 
"Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head—meaning, he will restore you to your former position. You will then hand him his cup, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer."

(Genesis 39:39) 
"Only remember me when things go well for you, and show me kindness. Mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison."

(Genesis 39:40) 
"For I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and here I am, innocent, thrown into this pit of a prison."

(Genesis 40:1) 
After all this, two royal officials of the King of Egypt—his chief butler and his chief baker—committed a sin against their lord, the king.

(Genesis 40:2) 
Pharaoh became very angry with these two royal officials, the chief butler and the chief baker. He had them sent to the prison in the house of the captain of the guard, which was the very place where Joseph was being held captive.

(Genesis 40:3) 
The captain of the guard placed these two officials under Joseph's care, and Joseph began to serve them. All the tasks performed in that part of the prison fell under Joseph's responsibility.

(Genesis 40:4) 
For some time, these men were kept under Joseph's watch. Joseph visited them frequently while they were in custody, ensuring they were served as instructed.

(Genesis 40:5) 
One night, both the butler and the baker, who were prisoners of the King of Egypt, each had a dream. Each dream held a specific interpretation for the one who dreamed it.

(Genesis 40:6) 
When Joseph came to them in the morning, he noticed that both of them looked sad and troubled.

(Genesis 40:7) 
So he asked them, "Why do you both look so much sadder than usual today?"

(Genesis 40:8) 
They answered him, saying, "We both had dreams, and there is no one here to interpret them for us." Joseph then said to them, "Doesn't the power to interpret dreams belong to God alone? Please tell me your dreams, and I will seek His understanding."

(Genesis 40:9) 
So the chief butler told Joseph his dream, saying, "In my dream, I saw a vine directly in front of me.

(Genesis 40:10) 
On this vine, there were three branches. As I watched, it slowly budded, then blossomed, and finally, ripe grapes appeared on the clusters.

(Genesis 40:11) 
I held Pharaoh's cup in my hand. I took the grapes, squeezed their juice directly into the cup I was holding, and then presented the drink to Pharaoh."

(Genesis 40:12) 
Joseph replied, "This is the meaning of your dream: the three branches represent three days from now.

(Genesis 40:13) 
Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, meaning he will restore you to your former position. You will then give him his cup, just as you used to do when you served as his butler before."

(Genesis 40:14) 
"Only remember me when things go well for you. Show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh so that you can get me out of this prison.

(Genesis 40:15) 
For I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and even here, I have done nothing to deserve being thrown into this pit."

(Genesis 40:16) 
When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted the dream so skillfully, he said, "I also had a dream. In my dream, I had three baskets of baked goods on my head.

(Genesis 40:17) 
In the topmost basket, there were all kinds of baked goods that Pharaoh usually eats, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."

(Genesis 40:18) 
Joseph responded, "This is the interpretation of your dream: the three baskets represent three days from now.

(Genesis 40:19) 
Within three days, Pharaoh will lift off your head, meaning he will execute you and hang your body on a tree. Then the birds of the sky will tear at your flesh."

(Genesis 40:20) 
And so it happened that on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he gave a great feast for all his servants. At this feast, he remembered the chief butler and the chief baker.

(Genesis 40:21) 
He restored the chief butler to his office, and once again the butler presented the cup to Pharaoh.

(Genesis 40:22) 
But he had the chief baker hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted their dreams for them.

(Genesis 40:23) 
Despite this, the chief butler did not remember Joseph. Instead, he completely forgot about him.

(Genesis 41:1) 
After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamt he was standing by the Nile River,

(Genesis 41:2) 
And suddenly, in his dream, seven beautiful, well-fed cows came up out of the river. They were grazing in a marshy place.

(Genesis 41:3) 
Then, seven other cows emerged from the river, but these were ugly and scrawny. They began to graze right next to the beautiful cows on the riverbank.

(Genesis 41:4) 
The ugly and scrawny cows then devoured the seven beautiful, well-fed cows. Pharaoh woke up from his dream.

(Genesis 41:5) 
He then fell asleep again and had another dream. In this dream, seven heads of grain, full and beautiful, were growing on a single stalk.

(Genesis 41:6) 
Then, seven other heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, grew up on a different stalk.

(Genesis 41:7) 
These thin heads of grain devoured all the beauty of the full, first heads of grain. Pharaoh woke up from his sleep and understood that these dreams were from God.

(Genesis 41:8) 
When morning came, Pharaoh was deeply troubled by the dream. He sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt, and he told them his dream, but none of them could interpret it for him.

(Genesis 41:9) 
Then, the chief cupbearer, remembering Joseph, spoke up and said, 'I must confess my fault to you now.'

(Genesis 41:10) 
'When Pharaoh was angry with me and the chief baker, you had us put in prison in the house of the captain of the guard.'

(Genesis 41:11) 
'One night, both he and I each had a dream, and each of our dreams had a mysterious meaning.'

(Genesis 41:12) 
'There was a young Hebrew man there, a servant of that same captain of the guard. When we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us.'

(Genesis 41:13) 
'And everything happened exactly as he predicted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.'

(Genesis 41:14) 
Immediately, at the king's command, Joseph was quickly brought out of the prison dungeon. They shaved him and changed his clothes, then brought him to Pharaoh.

(Genesis 41:15) 
Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it for me. But I have heard that you are able to interpret dreams with great wisdom.'

(Genesis 41:16) 
Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 'It is not within my power, but God Himself will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.'

(Genesis 41:17) 
So Pharaoh recounted what he had seen, saying, 'I dreamt that I was standing on the bank of the Nile River.'

(Genesis 41:18) 
'And suddenly, seven very beautiful and extremely well-fed cows came up out of the river. They grazed in the marshy places and remained standing near me.'

(Genesis 41:19) 
'Then, seven other cows came up, thin and extremely scrawny, with dried-out hides. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.'

(Genesis 41:20) 
'These scrawny cows devoured and consumed the first, fat, and beautiful cows.'

(Genesis 41:21) 
'Even after they had eaten them, there was no sign in their appearance that they had eaten at all; they remained as gaunt and scrawny as before. Then I woke up.'

(Genesis 41:22) 
'And again, I saw another dream: Seven heads of grain, full and excellent, were growing on a single stalk.'

(Genesis 41:23) 
'Then, seven other heads of grain grew up, thin and scorched by the east wind, producing only meager kernels.'

(Genesis 41:24) 
'These thin heads of grain devoured the beauty of the first ones. I have told this to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it.'

(Genesis 41:25) 
Joseph answered Pharaoh, 'Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.'

(Genesis 41:26) 
'The seven beautiful cows and the seven full heads of grain represent seven years of abundant harvests. The interpretation of both dreams is the same.'

(Genesis 41:27) 
'And the seven thin and scrawny cows that came up after them, as well as the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind, represent seven years of famine that are coming.'

(Genesis 41:28) 
'This is what I have told Pharaoh: God has shown you what is soon to happen.'

(Genesis 41:29) 
'Behold, seven years are coming, years of great abundance throughout all the land of Egypt.'

(Genesis 41:30) 
'These will be followed by seven other years of such severe famine that all the previous abundance in the land of Egypt will be completely forgotten. The famine will utterly consume the land.'

(Genesis 41:31) 
'There will be no remaining sign of the former abundance because of the severity of the famine that follows, which will utterly consume the entire land.'

(Genesis 41:32) 
'The fact that you saw the same matter in a second dream means that the word is firmly established by God, and He will swiftly bring it to pass.'

(Genesis 41:33) 
'Therefore, let Pharaoh now find a wise and discerning man and appoint him over the land of Egypt.'

(Genesis 41:34) 
'Let this man appoint overseers in every city to gather and store a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt during the coming seven years of abundance.'

(Genesis 41:35) 
'Let all the surplus grain, which will be sufficient for the five years of famine, be stored in the cities and kept securely.'

(Genesis 41:36) 
'Let this grain be ready for the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the land may not be ruined by scarcity.'

(Genesis 41:37) 
Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased with this advice.

(Genesis 41:38) 
Then Pharaoh said to his officials, 'Can we find anyone else like this man, in whom the Spirit of God is present?'

(Genesis 41:39) 
So Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'Since God has shown you all that you have spoken, surely I will not be able to find anyone wiser or with such discernment as you.'

(Genesis 41:40) 
'You shall be in charge of my household, and all my people will obey your every command. Only in the royal throne itself will I be greater than you.'

(Genesis 42:1) 
Jacob saw that grain and food were being sold in Egypt. He asked his sons, "Why are you just sitting here doing nothing?"

(Genesis 42:2) 
He continued, "I have heard that food is available for purchase in Egypt. Go down there and buy what we need to survive, so that we do not die of starvation."

(Genesis 42:3) 
So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain for themselves and their families.

(Genesis 42:4) 
But Jacob did not want to send Benjamin, Joseph's younger brother, with his other brothers. He was afraid that something terrible might happen to him on the journey.

(Genesis 42:5) 
The sons of Israel arrived in Egypt along with many others who had also come to buy food, because the land of Canaan was suffering greatly from the famine.

(Genesis 42:6) 
Joseph, as it happened, was the governor of the entire land of Egypt, and he was the one selling grain to all the people. When his brothers came before him, they bowed down with their faces to the ground in reverence.

(Genesis 42:7) 
Joseph saw them and immediately remembered the dreams he had once had about them. He spoke harshly to them, as if they were strangers, asking, "Where do you come from?" They replied, "From the land of Canaan, to buy necessities for life."

(Genesis 42:8) 
Joseph recognized them, but they did not recognize him.

(Genesis 42:9) 
He held them there for a short time and then said, "You are spies! You have come to find the vulnerable points of this land."

(Genesis 42:10) 
But they answered him, "No, my lord, that is not true. Your servants have only come to buy food."

(Genesis 42:11) 
"We are all the sons of one man; we are honest people. We have not come here to do any harm."

(Genesis 42:12) 
Joseph said to them, "No! You have indeed come to discover the vulnerable parts of this land."

(Genesis 42:13) 
They replied, "Your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is currently with our father, and another brother is no longer with us."

(Genesis 42:14) 
Joseph, testing them, said, "This confirms what I said: You are spies!"

(Genesis 42:15) 
"By this method, you will be tested. I swear by the life of Pharaoh himself, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here."

(Genesis 42:16) 
"Send one of you back to bring him here. The rest of you will be kept imprisoned until what you have said can be proven true or false."

(Genesis 42:17) 
And so he held them in custody for three days.

(Genesis 42:18) 
On the third day, he brought them out of the prison and said to them, "Do this one thing, and you will live, for I fear God."

(Genesis 42:19) 
"If you truly are honest people, then let one of your brothers be kept bound in the prison. The rest of you may go and take the grain you have purchased back to your homes."

(Genesis 42:20) 
"Then bring your youngest brother to me so I can verify your claims. If you do this, you will not die." They did as he had instructed.

(Genesis 42:21) 
They spoke to each other, saying, "We truly deserve to suffer this, because we sinned against our brother Joseph. We saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, but we refused to listen to him. That is why this tribulation has come upon us now."

(Genesis 42:22) 
Reuben said to them, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'? But you would not listen to me! Now, surely, the price for his blood is being demanded of us."

(Genesis 42:23) 
They did not know that Joseph understood everything they were saying, because he was speaking to them through an interpreter.

(Genesis 42:24) 
Joseph turned away from them for a moment and wept. Then he turned back and spoke to them. He took Simeon and had him bound in chains right there in front of their eyes.

(Genesis 42:25) 
Joseph then gave orders for their sacks to be filled with grain. He also commanded that each man's money be secretly returned to his sack and that they be given provisions for their journey. His servants did exactly as he instructed.

(Genesis 42:26) 
So the brothers loaded the grain onto their donkeys and departed.

(Genesis 42:27) 
As one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey at the lodging place, he saw his money right there at the mouth of the sack.

(Genesis 42:28) 
He cried out to his brothers, "My money has been returned to me! Look, it is right here in my sack!" They were astonished and troubled, asking each other, "What is this that God has done to us?"

(Genesis 42:29) 
When they arrived back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying:

(Genesis 42:30) 
"The lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies in his territory."

(Genesis 42:31) 
"We told him, 'We are honest men; we are not plotting against anyone.'"

(Genesis 42:32) 
"We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One of us is no longer living, and the youngest is currently with our father in the land of Canaan."

(Genesis 42:33) 
"Then he said, 'By this I will prove that you are honest people: leave one of your brothers with me. Take the necessary food for your households and go on your way.'"

(Genesis 42:34) 
"Then bring your youngest brother to me, so I can know that you are not spies. Then you can have your imprisoned brother back, and you will be free to trade in this land.'"

(Genesis 42:35) 
As they were telling this, they emptied their sacks. And behold, each man found his own pouch of money inside his sack! They and their father were terrified when they saw this.

(Genesis 42:36) 
Jacob cried out, "You have left me without my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon has been kept from me, and now you want to take Benjamin away! All these misfortunes have fallen upon me!"

(Genesis 42:37) 
Reuben responded to him, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you. Entrust him into my care, and I myself will bring him back."

(Genesis 42:38) 
But Jacob insisted, "My son will not go down to Egypt with you. His brother Joseph is dead, and he is the only son of Rachel left to me. If any harm were to befall him on this journey you are making, you would bring my gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow."

(Genesis 43:1) 
The famine continued to grow more severe in all the land.

(Genesis 43:2) 
After they had eaten all the grain they had brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons, "Go back to Egypt and buy a little more food for us."

(Genesis 43:3) 
Judah answered his father, "The man warned us with a solemn oath, saying, 'You will not see my face again unless your youngest brother is with you.'"

(Genesis 43:4) 
"So if you are willing to send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy food for you."

(Genesis 43:5) 
"But if you refuse to send him, we will not go down, because, as we have told you many times, that man explicitly warned us, saying, 'You will not see my face unless your youngest brother is with you.'"

(Genesis 43:6) 
Israel, also known as Jacob, said to them, "Why have you brought such trouble upon me by telling that man you had another son?"

(Genesis 43:7) 
But they answered, "The man questioned us very carefully about our family lineage, asking if our father was still alive, and if we had another brother. We answered him exactly according to what he asked. How could we possibly know that he would demand, 'Bring your brother with you?'"

(Genesis 43:8) 
Judah also said to his father, "Send the young man with me, so that we can leave right away. Then we can all live and not die of starvation—not only us, but also you and our little children."

(Genesis 43:9) 
"I will guarantee the young man's safety. Hold me personally responsible for his life. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will bear the guilt forever."

(Genesis 43:10) 
"If we had not delayed so much, we could have already gone and come back a second time."

(Genesis 43:11) 
So their father Israel said to them, "If it must be this way, then do what you must. Take some of the best produce of the land in your bags, and take a gift to the man: a little balm, a little honey, some gum tragacanth, some myrrh, some pistachios, and some almonds."

(Genesis 43:12) 
"Also, take double the amount of money with you, and take back the money that you found in your sacks. Perhaps it was put there by mistake."

(Genesis 43:13) 
"And take your brother Benjamin with you, and go back to the man."

(Genesis 43:14) 
"May my all-powerful God grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother, whom he is holding, along with this Benjamin. As for me, I feel as though I am already bereaved and childless."

(Genesis 43:15) 
So the men took the gifts, and double the money, and Benjamin. They set off for Egypt and stood before Joseph.

(Genesis 43:16) 
When Joseph saw them with Benjamin, he instructed the steward of his house, saying, "Bring these men into the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare a feast, for they are to dine with me at noon."

(Genesis 43:17) 
The steward did exactly as Joseph commanded him and brought the men into Joseph's house.

(Genesis 43:18) 
But the men, once brought inside, were afraid. They said, "We have been brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time. They want to frame us and violently seize us, taking us and our donkeys as slaves."

(Genesis 43:19) 
Therefore, they approached the steward of Joseph's house and spoke to him at the entrance.

(Genesis 43:20) 
(Continuing from the previous verse) "O sir, we really did come down here the first time to buy food."

(Genesis 43:21) 
"But when we returned to the inn and opened our sacks, we found each man's money right there at the mouth of his sack. We have now brought it back, exactly the same weight."

(Genesis 43:22) 
"We have also brought other money with us to buy more food. We truly do not know who put the money in our sacks the first time."

(Genesis 43:23) 
But the steward replied, "Peace be with you. Do not be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, must have given you treasure in your sacks. I assure you, I received your money the first time." Then he brought Simeon out to them.

(Genesis 43:24) 
After he had brought the men into the house, he brought water for them to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.

(Genesis 43:25) 
They prepared their gifts until Joseph arrived at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat the meal there.

(Genesis 43:26) 
When Joseph came into his house, they presented him with the gifts they held in their hands, and they bowed down before him, with their faces to the ground.

(Genesis 43:27) 
He greeted them kindly and asked, "Is your aged father, whom you spoke of to me, well? Is he still alive?"

(Genesis 43:28) 
They replied, "Your servant, our father, is well and still alive." Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves again before him.

(Genesis 43:29) 
And Joseph, looking up, saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, and asked, "Is this your youngest brother, about whom you told me?" Then he added, "May God be gracious to you, my son."

(Genesis 43:30) 
Joseph hurried away and went into his private room, because his heart was deeply moved with tender affection for his brother, and he began to weep. He went into his chamber and wept there.

(Genesis 43:31) 
After he had washed his face and composed himself, he came out and said, "Serve the food."

(Genesis 43:32) 
They served Joseph by himself, and his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves—because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, as such a shared meal was considered detestable to the Egyptians.

(Genesis 43:33) 
So the brothers were seated before Joseph, arranged from the eldest to the youngest. All of them were astonished, looking at each other in wonder.

(Genesis 43:34) 
Joseph then had portions of food taken from his own table and given to them. Benjamin's portion was five times larger than any of the others. And they drank and feasted joyfully with him.

(Genesis 44:1) 
Joseph then gave his house steward a command, saying: 'Fill their sacks with as much grain as they can carry, and put each man's money on top, in his sack.'

(Genesis 44:2) 
'But my own silver cup, and the money for it, you are to put into the mouth of the youngest man’s sack.'

(Genesis 44:3) 
When they woke up in the morning and loaded their donkeys, they left the city.

(Genesis 44:4) 
Now, after they had gone a short distance, Joseph called his house steward and said: 'Get up and pursue those men! When you catch them, ask: Why have you repaid good with evil?'

(Genesis 44:5) 
'The cup you have stolen is the one my master drinks from and uses for divination. You have done a very wicked thing.'

(Genesis 44:6) 
The steward pursued them, caught up, and said all the words Joseph had commanded him.

(Genesis 44:7) 
They replied: 'Why does our lord speak to his servants this way? Far be it from us to do such a thing!'

(Genesis 44:8) 
'We brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found at the top of our sacks. How could we steal silver or gold from your master's house?'

(Genesis 44:9) 
'If the cup is found with any of your servants, let that man die, and the rest of us will become your master's servants.'

(Genesis 44:10) 
The steward replied: 'Let it be as you say. The man with whom it is found will become my servant, but you others will be innocent.'

(Genesis 44:11) 
So they quickly lowered their sacks to the ground and each man opened his.

(Genesis 44:12) 
The steward searched, starting with the oldest and going down to the youngest, and he found the cup in Benjamin’s sack.

(Genesis 44:13) 
Immediately, they tore their clothes in grief, loaded their donkeys again, and returned to the city.

(Genesis 44:14) 
So Judah and his brothers entered Joseph’s house while he was still there. They prostrated themselves before him on the ground.

(Genesis 44:15) 
Joseph asked them: 'Why did you want to act this way? Do you not know that no one like me can divine what is hidden?'

(Genesis 44:16) 
Judah replied: 'What can we say to our lord? What can we speak? Or how can we respond justly? God has found the iniquity of your servants. Look, all of us are now servants of our lord, both we and the man with whom the cup was found.'

(Genesis 44:17) 
Joseph answered: 'Far be it from me to do that! The man who stole the cup, he alone will be my servant. But you others, go up freely to your father.'

(Genesis 44:18) 
Then Judah approached him and said: 'Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in your hearing, and do not be angry with your servant, for you are as powerful as Pharaoh himself.'

(Genesis 44:19) 
'My lord asked us, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?'

(Genesis 44:20) 
'And we answered him: We have an aged father, and a young boy born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and our father truly loves him.'

(Genesis 44:21) 
'You also said to your servants: Bring him down to me, so I may look at him.'

(Genesis 44:22) 
'We replied: The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.'

(Genesis 44:23) 
'And you said to your servants: Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you will not see my face again.'

(Genesis 44:24) 
'So when we went up to your servant, our father, we told him everything our lord had said.'

(Genesis 44:25) 
'And our father said: Go back and buy us a little grain.'

(Genesis 44:26) 
'To which we said: We cannot go. If our youngest brother comes down with us, then we will go together. Otherwise, without him, we do not dare to see the man’s face.'

(Genesis 44:27) 
'To this our father replied: You yourselves know that I had two sons by my wife.'

(Genesis 44:28) 
'One left, and you said: A wild beast devoured him. And until the present day, you do not know where he is.'

(Genesis 44:29) 
'If you also take this one, and anything happens to him on the journey, you will bring my gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow.'

(Genesis 44:30) 
'Therefore, if I go to your servant, our father, and the boy is not with me—whose very life is bound up with his father's—'

(Genesis 44:31) 
'when he suddenly sees that the boy is not there, he will die. And your servants will bring his gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow.'

(Genesis 44:32) 
'I myself guaranteed the boy's safety to my father, saying: If I do not bring him back to you, I will be guilty of sin against my father for all my days.'

(Genesis 44:33) 
'Now therefore, I beg you, let your servant remain here as a servant in your place, instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.'

(Genesis 44:34) 
'For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I see the calamity that would overcome my father.'

(Genesis 45:1) 
Joseph could no longer control his emotions in front of everyone present. So, he ordered everyone to leave, so that no outsider would be there when he spoke with his family.

(Genesis 45:2) 
Then Joseph cried out loudly, weeping, and the Egyptians heard it, and all of Pharaoh’s household heard it.

(Genesis 45:3) 
He said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But they could not answer him, because they were terrified.

(Genesis 45:4) 
Then he said to his brothers, "Come closer to me." And when they came closer, he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."

(Genesis 45:5) 
Do not be distressed or blame yourselves for selling me into this region. God, in His divine plan, sent me ahead of you to preserve your lives.

(Genesis 45:6) 
For it has been two years since the famine began in this land, and there are still five more years to come during which neither plowing nor harvesting will be possible.

(Genesis 45:7) 
God sent me ahead of you so that you might be preserved on the earth, and that you might have food to keep yourselves alive.

(Genesis 45:8) 
So it was not by your doing, but by God’s design, that I was sent here. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh, lord over his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.

(Genesis 45:9) 
Hurry, go up to my father and tell him: 'Your son Joseph says this: God has made me lord over all the land of Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!'

(Genesis 45:10) 
You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your sheep, your cattle, and everything you own.

(Genesis 45:11) 
There I will provide for you (for there are still five years of famine ahead), so that you, your household, and everything you own will not suffer want.

(Genesis 45:12) 
Behold, your own eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that it is my own mouth speaking to you.

(Genesis 45:13) 
Tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him down to me.

(Genesis 45:14) 
Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept; and Benjamin likewise wept upon his neck.

(Genesis 45:15) 
Joseph then kissed all his brothers and wept over each one of them. After this, his brothers finally dared to speak with him.

(Genesis 45:16) 
News spread quickly through Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had arrived, and Pharaoh and all his officials were very pleased.

(Genesis 45:17) 
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Command your brothers to load their pack animals and set out for the land of Canaan."

(Genesis 45:18) 
"Let them bring your father and all their relatives back here to me. I will give them all the best of Egypt, so they may enjoy the richness of the land."

(Genesis 45:19) 
"Also command them to take wagons from the land of Egypt for themselves, their little ones, and their wives, and to bring your father quickly."

(Genesis 45:20) 
"Do not worry about any of your belongings, because all the finest things in Egypt will be yours."

(Genesis 45:21) 
The sons of Israel did as they were instructed. Joseph gave them wagons, according to Pharaoh’s command, and also provisions for their journey.

(Genesis 45:22) 
To each of them, he also gave a set of new clothes. But to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of new clothes.

(Genesis 45:23) 
He also sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food supplies for his journey.

(Genesis 45:24) 
So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he told them, "Do not quarrel on the journey."

(Genesis 45:25) 
So they went up from Egypt and arrived in the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.

(Genesis 45:26) 
They told him, saying, "Joseph is alive! And he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt!" When Jacob heard this, it was as if he awoke from a deep sleep, and he did not believe them.

(Genesis 45:27) 
But when they recounted all the words Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons and all the supplies Joseph had sent, Jacob’s spirit was revived.

(Genesis 45:28) 
And Jacob said, "It is enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die."

(Genesis 46:1) 
So Israel set out with everything he owned. He came to the place called the Well of the Oath. There, he offered sacrifices and called upon the God of his father, Isaac.

(Genesis 46:2) 
And God spoke to him through a vision at night, saying, 'Jacob! Jacob!' And he answered, 'Here I am.'

(Genesis 46:3) 
God said to him, 'I am the Almighty God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.'

(Genesis 46:4) 
I myself will go down with you into Egypt, and I will surely bring you back from there. And Joseph himself will be there to close your eyes when you die.'

(Genesis 46:5) 
So Jacob rose up from the Well of the Oath. His sons then carried him, his children, and his wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport the old man.

(Genesis 46:6) 
They also took all the possessions he had acquired in the land of Canaan. So Jacob and all his offspring together came into Egypt.

(Genesis 46:7) 
His sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters—all of his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.

(Genesis 46:8) 
These are the names of the sons of Israel who went into Egypt: Jacob himself and his children. His firstborn was Reuben.

(Genesis 46:9) 
The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

(Genesis 46:10) 
The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul—who was the son of a Canaanite woman.

(Genesis 46:11) 
The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

(Genesis 46:12) 
The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. However, Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan. The sons born to Perez were Hezron and Hamul.

(Genesis 46:13) 
The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.

(Genesis 46:14) 
The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.

(Genesis 46:15) 
These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, and Dinah was also his daughter. All the souls of males and females were thirty-three.

(Genesis 46:16) 
The sons of Gad were Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.

(Genesis 46:17) 
The sons of Asher were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel.

(Genesis 46:18) 
These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. And these Jacob bore to her, a total of sixteen souls.

(Genesis 46:19) 
The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.

(Genesis 46:20) 
And sons were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him: Manasseh and Ephraim.

(Genesis 46:21) 
The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.

(Genesis 46:22) 
These are the sons of Rachel, whom Jacob bore to her, all of them fourteen souls.

(Genesis 46:23) 
The sons of Dan were Hushim.

(Genesis 46:24) 
The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.

(Genesis 46:25) 
These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. And Jacob bore these to her, all of them seven souls.

(Genesis 46:26) 
All the souls who entered Egypt with Jacob, those who came from his loins, excluding his sons' wives, were sixty-six in total.

(Genesis 46:27) 
As for Joseph's sons, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, there were two souls. All the souls of Jacob's household who entered Egypt were seventy in total.

(Genesis 46:28) 
Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to announce his coming and for Joseph to meet him in Goshen.

(Genesis 46:29) 
Joseph then harnessed his chariot and went up to meet his father in Goshen. As soon as he saw him, he rushed to embrace him, and wept while holding him.

(Genesis 46:30) 
And Israel said to Joseph, 'Now I will be glad to die, since I have seen your face, and I leave you alive and well.'

(Genesis 46:31) 
Then Joseph said to his brothers and to all his father's household, 'I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and I will say to him: My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.'

(Genesis 46:32) 
And these men are shepherds of sheep; they are keepers of livestock. They have brought their flocks, their herds, and everything they possess with them.

(Genesis 46:33) 
So when Pharaoh calls you and asks, 'What is your occupation?'

(Genesis 46:34) 
You shall answer: 'Your servants have been shepherds from our youth until now, both we and our fathers.' You must say this so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, because all shepherds are an abomination to the Egyptians.

(Genesis 47:1) 
Joseph then arrived and informed Pharaoh, saying, "My father and my brothers, with their sheep, their herds, and all their possessions, have come from the land of Canaan. Look, they are now settled in the land of Goshen."

(Genesis 47:2) 
And he presented five of his brothers before the king.

(Genesis 47:3) 
Pharaoh asked them, "What is your work?" They answered, "Your servants are shepherds of sheep, both we and our fathers before us."

(Genesis 47:4) 
They added, "We have come to live in your land, for your servants' flocks can find no pasture in Canaan because the famine is very severe. We therefore ask you to command your servants to settle in the land of Goshen."

(Genesis 47:5) 
Pharaoh then said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you."

(Genesis 47:6) 
The land of Egypt is before you. Make them live in the very best area, and give them the land of Goshen. And if you know there are any capable men among them, appoint them as overseers of my own livestock.

(Genesis 47:7) 
Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him before the king, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

(Genesis 47:8) 
Pharaoh asked him, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"

(Genesis 47:9) 
Jacob answered, "The days of my pilgrimage have been one hundred and thirty years. They have been few and difficult, and they have not reached the length of the years of my fathers' lives during which they sojourned."

(Genesis 47:10) 
And blessing the king again, he departed.

(Genesis 47:11) 
Joseph then gave his father and his brothers a possession in Egypt, in the very best places of the land, in the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had commanded.

(Genesis 47:12) 
And he nourished them and his entire father's household, providing food for each one.

(Genesis 47:13) 
In all the land, bread was lacking, and the famine prevailed throughout the world. Both Egypt and the land of Canaan were failing due to the scarcity of food.

(Genesis 47:14) 
Joseph purchased all the money of the Egyptians and Canaanites from them in exchange for the grain they bought. And he gathered all that money into the king's treasury.

(Genesis 47:15) 
When the money ran out, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, "Give us food! Why should we die before you, now that our money has failed?"

(Genesis 47:16) 
He replied to them, "Give your livestock, and I will give you food."

(Genesis 47:17) 
So they brought their livestock to Joseph. And he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. He sustained them for that entire year by exchanging their livestock for food.

(Genesis 47:18) 
They came again in the second year, saying, "We cannot hide from our lord that, with our money exhausted and our livestock transferred to you, we have nothing left to offer except our bodies and our land."

(Genesis 47:19) 
"Why should we die while you watch, both we and our land? Buy us and our land with food, and we and our fields will become servants of the king. Provide for us so that we can sow seed, and not die, nor our land become desolate."

(Genesis 47:20) 
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, as each person sold their possessions because of the severity of the famine. And he made it subject to Pharaoh.

(Genesis 47:21) 
And he moved all the people into the cities, from one end of Egypt to the other.

(Genesis 47:22) 
The lands of the priests were exempt, for they had been given to them by the king. They also received a fixed allowance of food each year, and therefore they were not compelled to sell their possessions.

(Genesis 47:23) 
Joseph then said to the people, "Look, as you see, Pharaoh has bought both you and your land. Take seeds for yourselves, and sow the fields."

(Genesis 47:24) 
When you gather the harvest, you will give a fifth part to the king. The four remaining parts will be yours for seed, and for food for your families and your children.

(Genesis 47:25) 
They answered, "Our salvation is in your hands. May our lord only look favorably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king."

(Genesis 47:26) 
From that day until the present day, a fifth part is paid to the kings throughout all the land of Egypt, except for the land of the priests, which remained free.

(Genesis 47:27) 
So Israel lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they took possession of it, increased, and multiplied greatly.

(Genesis 47:28) 
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years. So all the days of his life were one hundred and forty-seven years.

(Genesis 47:29) 
As the time of his death drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, that you may show me kindness and fidelity, and not bury me in Egypt.

(Genesis 47:30) 
But let me rest with my fathers, and carry me out of this land, and bury me in the tomb of my ancestors." Joseph answered him, "I will do as you have commanded."

(Genesis 47:31) 
And Jacob said, "Swear to me." And Joseph swore to him. Then Israel, turning towards the head of his bed, worshipped God.

(Genesis 48:1) 
After these things had happened, Joseph was told that his father, Jacob, was very ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see him.

(Genesis 48:2) 
And it was announced to the old man, Jacob: 'Look, your son Joseph is coming to you!' And Jacob, strengthening himself, sat up in his bed.

(Genesis 48:3) 
And Jacob said to Joseph: 'God Almighty appeared to me in Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

(Genesis 48:4) 
and said: 'I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make you into a multitude of peoples. And I will give this land to you and to your descendants after you, as an eternal possession.'

(Genesis 48:5) 
Now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you here, they are counted as my own. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.

(Genesis 48:6) 
But the rest of your children whom you have had after them shall be yours, and they will be named after their brothers in their inheritances.

(Genesis 48:7) 
When I was returning from Mesopotamia, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan, on the journey itself, as I was coming to Ephrath. There was only a short distance left on the road to reach Bethlehem. Therefore, I buried her there.

(Genesis 48:8) 
Now Jacob, seeing Joseph's sons, said: 'Who are these young men?'

(Genesis 48:9) 
Joseph answered him: 'They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place.' And Jacob said: 'Bring them closer to me, so that I may bless them.'

(Genesis 48:10) 
Now, Jacob's eyes were dim because of his old age, and he could not see clearly from a distance. So he brought them close to himself, kissed and embraced them.

(Genesis 48:11) 
He said to Joseph: 'I thought I would never see your face again; but God has shown me even your descendants.'

(Genesis 48:12) 
And when Joseph had moved his sons from their father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.

(Genesis 48:13) 
And Joseph took Ephraim in his right hand, to place him at Jacob's left, and Manasseh in his left hand, to place him at Jacob's right, and brought both of them close to his father.

(Genesis 48:14) 
But Jacob, extending his right hand, placed it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, the older brother, crossing his hands.

(Genesis 48:15) 
And he blessed Joseph, and said: 'May God, in whose presence my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me from my youth until this very day, bless them:

(Genesis 48:16) 
May the Angel who has redeemed me from all evils bless these boys. May my name be invoked upon them, and the names of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, too. And may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.'

(Genesis 48:17) 
Now when Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, he was displeased. So he took hold of his father's hand, wishing to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head,

(Genesis 48:18) 
saying: 'Not like that, Father, because this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand upon his head.'

(Genesis 48:19) 
But Jacob refused, saying: 'I know, my son, I know. He, Manasseh, will also become a people, and he will be multiplied. But his younger brother, Ephraim, will be greater than he, and his descendants will grow into a multitude of nations.'

(Genesis 48:20) 
And he blessed them that day, saying: 'Through you, Israel will be blessed, and it will be said: 'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.'' And he placed Ephraim before Manasseh.

(Genesis 48:21) 
Then Jacob said to Joseph: 'Behold, I am about to die. But God will be with you, and He will bring you back to the land of your fathers.'

(Genesis 48:22) 
'Moreover, I am giving you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.'

(Genesis 49:1) 
Then Jacob called his sons to him, and he said to them: 'Gather around me, so I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days of history.'

(Genesis 49:2) 
'Gather around me and listen, you sons of Jacob; listen to Israel your father.'

(Genesis 49:3) 
'Reuben, my firstborn, you were my strength, the first fruit of my vigor, excelling in dignity and in power.'

(Genesis 49:4) 
'You were unstable, poured out like water; you shall no longer excel, for you went up to your father’s bed and defiled my couch.'

(Genesis 49:5) 
'Simeon and Levi are brothers, and their weapons are instruments of violence and injustice.'

(Genesis 49:6) 
'May my soul never enter into their schemes, nor may my glory be united with their assembly, for in their rage, they killed men, and in their self-will, they destroyed walls (cities).'

(Genesis 49:7) 
'Cursed be their anger, because it was fierce; and their indignation, because it was cruel. I will divide them throughout Jacob and disperse them within Israel.'

(Genesis 49:8) 
'Judah, your brothers shall praise you: your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; the sons of your father shall bow down to you.'

(Genesis 49:9) 
'Judah is a lion's cub; you have gone up, my son, to seize the prey. You crouched down and lay like a lion, and like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?'

(Genesis 49:10) 
'The scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, nor a ruler from his descendants, until He comes for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation of the nations (the Messiah).'

(Genesis 49:11) 
'He shall tie his donkey's colt to the vine, and his donkey to the choicest vine. He will wash his robes in wine, and his garments in the blood of grapes, signifying abundant prosperity.'

(Genesis 49:12) 
'His eyes are brighter (more sparkling) than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (signifying health and beauty).'

(Genesis 49:13) 
'Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; he shall be a haven for ships, and his border shall reach as far as Sidon.'

(Genesis 49:14) 
'Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two burdens (or territories).'

(Genesis 49:15) 
'He saw that rest was good, and that the land was pleasant, so he bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, and became a servant (of tribute).'

(Genesis 49:16) 
'Dan shall judge his people, as one of the other tribes of Israel.'

(Genesis 49:17) 
'May Dan be a serpent by the way, a viper in the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider falls backward, acting with cunning and surprise.'

(Genesis 49:18) 
'I await your salvation, O Lord (a sudden prayer of Jacob).'

(Genesis 49:19) 
'Gad, a troop shall press upon him (attack him), but he shall press upon their rear (or overcome them in the end).'

(Genesis 49:20) 
'Asher, his bread shall be rich (or abundant and fertile), and he shall yield dainties (luxurious food) for kings.'

(Genesis 49:21) 
'Naphtali is a swift deer (or a hind let loose), uttering beautiful words (or giving good tidings).'

(Genesis 49:22) 
'Joseph is a fruitful son, a fruitful son by a spring, a beautiful young plant whose branches run over the wall (meaning his offspring will spread far).'

(Genesis 49:23) 
'The archers provoked him, contended with him, and shot at him with bitter arrows (representing the malice of his enemies).'

(Genesis 49:24) 
'But his bow remained strong, and the strength of his arms was made firm by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob—from there came the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (referring to God's protection of Joseph and a prophetic reference to Christ).'

(Genesis 49:25) 
'The God of your father shall be your helper, and the Almighty shall bless you with blessings from the universe above (rain and dew), with blessings from the deep (springs and fertile ground) below, with blessings of the breasts and of the womb (fertility and numerous offspring).'

(Genesis 49:26) 
'The blessings of your father are stronger than the blessings of my fathers (forefathers), reaching even to the desired summits of the everlasting hills (representing lasting and abundant prosperity).'

(Genesis 49:27) 
'Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning, he devours the prey, and in the evening, he divides the spoils (indicating a warlike and fierce tribe).'

(Genesis 49:28) 
'All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them, blessing each one according to his own specific blessing (or prophecy).'

(Genesis 49:29) 
And he charged them, saying: 'I am about to be gathered to my people (to die); bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,'

(Genesis 49:30) 
'near the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, opposite Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham purchased, along with the field, from the sons of Heth, as a burial possession (a place of rest for the family).'

(Genesis 49:31) 
'There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there Leah was buried.'

(Genesis 49:32) 
When he had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up onto the bed, and he died, and was gathered to his people (his ancestors who had passed on).

(Genesis 50:1) 
Joseph saw his father was dead, and he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.

(Genesis 50:2) 
Then he ordered his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father with spices.

(Genesis 50:3) 
After these orders, they completed the task. Forty days passed—this was the usual custom for embalmed bodies. And all of Egypt mourned for him for seventy days.

(Genesis 50:4) 
When the mourning period was finished, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s household, saying, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh on my behalf:

(Genesis 50:5) 
My father made me swear, saying, 'I am about to die. In my tomb, which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you will bury me.' Therefore, I ask to go up and bury my father, and then I will return."

(Genesis 50:6) 
Pharaoh said to him, "Go up and bury your father, as you have sworn to him."

(Genesis 50:7) 
So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went all the elders of Pharaoh's household and all the leading elders of the land of Egypt,

(Genesis 50:8) 
along with Joseph's household, his brothers, and all his relatives. Only their little children, their flocks, and their herds, which they had left in the land of Goshen, remained behind.

(Genesis 50:9) 
They also had chariots and horsemen in their procession, and it was a very great company.

(Genesis 50:10) 
When they came to the Threshing Floor of Atad, which is located beyond the Jordan, they celebrated the funeral rites with great and intense lamentation, observing seven days of mourning there.

(Genesis 50:11) 
When the inhabitants of the land of Canaan saw the mourning at the Threshing Floor of Atad, they said, "This is a profound mourning for the Egyptians." For this reason, the place was named Planctus Aegypti, which means 'Mourning of the Egyptians'.

(Genesis 50:12) 
Thus, Jacob’s sons did just as he had commanded them.

(Genesis 50:13) 
They carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field, as a burial possession facing Mamre.

(Genesis 50:14) 
After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all the company that had gone with him.

(Genesis 50:15) 
After their father's death, Joseph's brothers were afraid and said to one another, "What if Joseph still holds a grudge against us and repays us for all the harm we did to him?"

(Genesis 50:16) 
So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave us this command before he died,

(Genesis 50:17) 
'Please forgive your brothers' wickedness and the sin they committed against you.' It was indeed evil, but now we implore you to forgive this iniquity, for we are the servants of your father’s God." When he heard these words, Joseph wept.

(Genesis 50:18) 
Then his brothers themselves came to him, prostrating themselves on the ground, and said, "We are your servants."

(Genesis 50:19) 
Joseph answered them, "Do not be afraid. Am I in God’s place, to oppose His will?"

(Genesis 50:20) 
You intended evil against me, but God turned it into good, so that He might exalt me as you see today, and save many people.

(Genesis 50:21) 
Therefore, do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." So he comforted them and spoke to them with kind words.

(Genesis 50:22) 
So Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his father's household. He lived for one hundred and ten years.

(Genesis 50:23) 
He lived to see Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children of Machir, Manasseh's son, were also born and received into Joseph's family.

(Genesis 50:24) 
After these events, Joseph spoke to his brothers, saying, "After my death, God will certainly visit you and lead you out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

(Genesis 50:25) 
And he made them swear, saying, "When God visits you, make sure you carry my bones with you from this place."

(Genesis 50:26) 
Then Joseph died, having completed the span of his life at one hundred and ten years old. And after he was embalmed with spices, he was placed in a sarcophagus in Egypt.
