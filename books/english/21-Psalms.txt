(Psalms 9:19) 
Arise, Lord, let no human be strengthened against You; let the nations be judged in your sight.

(Psalms 9:20) 
Appoint, Lord, a lawgiver over them, so that the nations may know that they are but men. (A musical interlude.)

(Psalms 9:21) 
Why, Lord, have you withdrawn so far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of need, in affliction?

(Psalms 9:22) 
While the wicked person acts proudly, the poor are set ablaze by his actions; they are caught in the very schemes the wicked devise.

(Psalms 9:23) 
For the sinner is praised for the desires of his own soul, and the unrighteous is blessed by others for his evil ways.

(Psalms 9:24) 
The sinner has provoked the Lord; in the arrogance of his anger, he will not seek God.

(Psalms 9:25) 
There is no God in his sight, so he acts as if God doesn't exist; his ways are defiled at all times. Your judgments are far from his mind; he will lord it over all his enemies.

(Psalms 9:26) 
For he has said in his heart: 'I will not be moved from generation to generation; no misfortune will touch me.'

(Psalms 9:27) 
His mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and deceit; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.

(Psalms 9:28) 
He sits in ambush with the rich in hidden places, so that he may kill the innocent. His eyes watch for the poor.

(Psalms 9:29) 
He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den; he lies in wait to seize the poor: to seize the poor when he draws him in.

(Psalms 9:30) 
In his snare, he will bring him low; the poor man will fall into it, when the wicked's strength against the poor increases.

(Psalms 9:31) 
For he has said in his heart: 'God has forgotten, He has turned away His face, so that He will not see until the end.'

(Psalms 9:32) 
Arise, Lord God, let your hand be exalted: do not forget the oppressed.

(Psalms 9:33) 
Why has the wicked person provoked God? For he has said in his heart: 'He will not seek vengeance for my actions.'

(Psalms 9:34) 
You see, for you consider trouble and sorrow, that you may deliver them into your hands. To you the poor is left; you are the helper of the orphan.

(Psalms 9:35) 
Break the arm of the sinner and the malicious one: his sin will be sought out, but none will be found for him to commit.

(Psalms 9:36) 
The Lord will reign forever and for all ages; you, nations, will perish from His land.

(Psalms 9:37) 
The Lord has heard the desire of the oppressed; your ear has heard the preparation of their heart as they prayed.

(Psalms 9:38) 
To judge for the orphan and the humble, so that man may no longer presume to exalt himself upon the earth.

(Psalms 9:39) 
To the chief musician. A Psalm of David. In the Lord I take refuge: how can you say to my soul: 'Flee to the mountain like a sparrow?'

(Psalms 9:40) 
For behold, sinners have bent their bow, they have prepared their arrows in their quiver, so that they may shoot the upright in heart in the darkness of the moon—in secret.

(Psalms 9:1) 
For the director of the choir, for the hidden mysteries of the Son. A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 9:2) 
I will give You praise, O Lord, with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonderful works.

(Psalms 9:3) 
I will rejoice and be filled with gladness in You; I will sing praises to Your name, O Most High.

(Psalms 9:4) 
When my enemy turns back, they will stumble and perish from Your presence.

(Psalms 9:5) 
Because You have upheld my right and my cause; You are seated on Your throne, judging all things with perfect justice.

(Psalms 9:6) 
You have rebuked the nations, and the wicked have perished; You have blotted out their name forever and for all ages of ages.

(Psalms 9:7) 
The swords of the enemy have come to their end, and You have utterly destroyed their cities; their memory has perished with a loud crash.

(Psalms 9:8) 
But the Lord remains enthroned forever; He has prepared His throne for judgment.

(Psalms 9:9) 
And He Himself will judge the whole earth with equity, He will judge the peoples with perfect justice.

(Psalms 9:10) 
The Lord has become a refuge for the poor, a helper in times of need, in all tribulation.

(Psalms 9:11) 
And let those who know Your name hope in You, for You have not abandoned those who seek You, O Lord.

(Psalms 9:12) 
Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Sion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.

(Psalms 9:13) 
For He who seeks vengeance for their blood has remembered them; He has not forgotten the cry of the poor.

(Psalms 9:14) 
Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my affliction from my enemies,

(Psalms 9:15) 
You who lift me up from the gates of death,

(Psalms 9:16) 
so that I may proclaim all Your praises within the gates of the Daughter of Sion.

(Psalms 9:17) 
I will rejoice greatly in Your salvation.

(Psalms 9:18) 
The nations have sunk into the destruction they themselves made; their foot has been caught in the snare they had hidden.

(Psalms 9:19) 
The Lord is known by the judgments He executes; the sinner is caught in the works of his own hands.

(Psalms 9:20) 
Let sinners turn back to hell—to the place of the dead—all the nations that forget God.

(Psalms 9:21) 
For the poor will not be forgotten forever; the patience of the poor will not perish for all time.

(Psalms 9:22) 
Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in Your sight.

(Psalms 9:23) 
Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them, so that the nations may know that they are merely men.

(Psalms 9:24) 
Why, O Lord, have You withdrawn afar? Why do You disregard us in our times of need, in tribulation?

(Psalms 9:25) 
While the wicked man boasts, the poor are set on fire; they are caught in the very schemes they devise.

(Psalms 9:26) 
For the sinner is praised for the desires of his own soul, and the wicked man blesses himself.

(Psalms 9:27) 
The sinner has provoked the Lord; in the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek God.

(Psalms 9:28) 
God is not in his sight; his ways are defiled at all times.

(Psalms 9:29) 
Your judgments are far removed from his sight; he will lord it over all his enemies.

(Psalms 9:30) 
For he has said in his heart: 'I will not be moved from generation to generation, I will suffer no evil.'

(Psalms 9:31) 
His mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and deceit; under his tongue are mischief and pain.

(Psalms 9:32) 
He sits in ambush with the rich in hidden places, so that he may kill the innocent.

(Psalms 9:33) 
His eyes watch for the poor; he lies in wait in secret, like a lion in its den.

(Psalms 9:34) 
He lies in wait to seize the poor; he seizes the poor while he draws them in.

(Psalms 9:35) 
He will humble him with his snare; he will bow down, and fall when he has gained mastery over the poor.

(Psalms 9:36) 
For he has said in his heart: 'God has forgotten; He has turned away His face, so that He may not see for all time.'

(Psalms 9:37) 
Arise, O Lord God, let Your hand be lifted high; do not forget the poor.

(Psalms 9:38)

(Psalms 9:39) 
You see, for You consider toil and sorrow, so that You may deliver them into Your hands.

(Psalms 9:40) 
To You the poor man is abandoned; You are the helper of the orphan.

(Psalms 10:1) 
How long, O Lord, have You withdrawn from us, standing far off and looking down upon us during times of need and tribulation?

(Psalms 10:2) 
When the wicked act with pride, the poor are set aflame with suffering. The poor are trapped by the very plans the wicked devise against them.

(Psalms 10:3) 
For the sinner is praised by others because of the desires of his own soul, and the unrighteous person is seen by many as blessed.

(Psalms 10:4) 
The sinner has provoked the Lord; in the greatness of his pride and anger, he does not seek God's presence or judgment.

(Psalms 10:5) 
God is not in his thoughts. His ways are corrupt at all times. Your judgments, O God, are too high for him to see, and he believes he will dominate all his enemies.

(Psalms 10:6) 
For he has said in his heart: 'I will never be shaken from my position, from generation to generation, and no harm will ever come to me.'

(Psalms 10:7) 
His mouth is full of cursing, bitterness, and deceit. Under his tongue are both trouble and iniquity.

(Psalms 10:8) 
He sits in ambush, hidden with other powerful and rich men, to murder the innocent.

(Psalms 10:9) 
His eyes watch the poor. He lies in wait in secret, like a lion in its den. He lies in wait to seize the poor; he seizes the poor by dragging him into his trap.

(Psalms 10:10) 
With his snare, he humiliates the poor. The poor man is bowed down and falls when the wicked man has gained mastery over him.

(Psalms 10:11) 
For he has said in his heart: 'God has forgotten. He has turned away His face so that He will never see anything.'

(Psalms 10:12) 
Arise, O Lord God! Let Your hand be lifted high in power. Do not forget the suffering poor.

(Psalms 10:13) 
Why has the wicked man provoked God? For he has said in his heart: 'God will not seek or investigate these things.'

(Psalms 10:14) 
You see it all, for You consider the trouble and sorrow of the poor, so that You may take them into Your hands. The poor man is left to Your care; You will be the helper for the orphan.

(Psalms 10:15) 
Break the power of the wicked and malicious sinner. His sin will be sought out, but it will not be found; it will be utterly removed.

(Psalms 10:16)

(Psalms 10:18)

(Psalms 10:1) 
For the Consummation: A Psalm of David. (Commentary: "In finem" signifies the ultimate purpose or fulfillment, often understood eschatologically in Christian tradition, pointing to Christ.)

(Psalms 10:2) 
I take my refuge in the Lord. How can you say to my soul: "Flee to the mountain like a small bird?"

(Psalms 10:3) 
For behold, the wicked have drawn their bows; they have made ready their arrows in their quivers, to shoot under cover of darkness at the upright in heart.

(Psalms 10:4) 
For what You, O Lord, have established, they have torn down. But what can the righteous do in such times?

(Psalms 10:5) 
The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in the heavens above, where He reigns. His eyes look upon the afflicted; His gaze examines the children of men.

(Psalms 10:6) 
The Lord examines the righteous and the wicked. But he who loves wickedness hates his own soul, bringing destruction upon himself.

(Psalms 10:7) 
He will rain down snares upon the wicked. Fire and brimstone, and a tempestuous wind, are the portion of their cup—their decreed fate.

(Psalms 10:8) 
For the Lord is righteous, and He loves acts of righteousness. His countenance beholds uprightness and justice.

(Psalms 10:9) 
For the Consummation. For the Eighth String (a musical instruction): A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 10:10) 
Save me, O Lord, for the holy person has vanished. Truths have diminished among the children of men.

(Psalms 10:11) 
They have spoken falsehoods, each one to his neighbor. They have spoken with deceptive lips and a divided heart, meaning they say one thing and believe another.

(Psalms 10:12) 
The Lord will bring to an end the scattered words and the boastful tongue.

(Psalms 10:13) 
All who speak with deceitful lips and a boastful tongue will be silenced.

(Psalms 10:14) 
He will deal with those who have said: "We will make our tongue great. Our lips are our own power. Who is our master?"

(Psalms 10:15) 
Because of the misery of the needy and the groaning of the poor, "Now I will arise," says the Lord. "I will place him in safety; I will act with certainty for him."

The words of the Lord are pure words. They are like silver tested by fire, purified seven times in the crucible of the earth, meaning they are utterly flawless.

(Psalms 10:17) 
You, O Lord, will preserve us and keep us safe from this evil generation forever.

(Psalms 10:18) 
For the Consummation: A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 10:19) 
How long, O Lord, will You forget me completely? How long will You turn Your face away from me?

How long must I harbor anxieties in my soul, and sorrow in my heart day after day?

(Psalms 10:21) 
How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

(Psalms 10:22) 
Look upon me and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes with Your truth, lest I ever fall asleep in the sleep of death, losing hope and faith.

Let my enemy never say, "I have prevailed against him." Let those who trouble me not rejoice if I am moved from my faith.

(Psalms 10:24) 
For the Consummation: A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 10:25) 
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They have become corrupt and abominable in their pursuits. There is no one who does good, not even one person.

(Psalms 10:26) 
The Lord looked down from the heavens upon the children of men to see if there was anyone who understood, or anyone who sought God.

(Psalms 10:27) 
All have turned away; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good, not even one. Their throat is like an open tomb, their tongues practice deceit. The venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways, and they have not known the path of peace. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

(Psalms 10:28) 
Will they not come to know, all those who work wickedness, who devour My people as if they were bread to be eaten?

(Psalms 10:29) 
They have not called upon God. There, they trembled with fear where no fear truly existed.

(Psalms 10:30) 
For the Lord is with the righteous generation. You have confounded the plan of the poor, because the Lord is his protector.

(Psalms 10:31) 
Who will grant salvation to Israel from Sion? When the Lord reverses the captivity of His people, Jacob will rejoice, and Israel will be glad.

(Psalms 10:32) 
A Psalm of David. O Lord, who will dwell in Your tabernacle? Or who will rest on Your holy mountain?

(Psalms 10:33) 
He who walks without blemish, and practices righteousness;

(Psalms 10:34) 
he who speaks truth in his heart, who has not practiced deceit with his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbor, nor taken up a reproach against his neighbors;

(Psalms 10:35) 
the wicked person is brought to nothing in his sight, but he glorifies those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and does not deceive him;

(Psalms 10:36) 
he who has not lent his money at interest, and has not accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does these things will not be moved from his righteous state forever.

(Psalms 10:37) 
An inscription of a title belonging to David. Preserve me, O Lord, for in You I have placed my hope and trust.

(Psalms 10:38) 
I said to the Lord: "You are my God, for You have no need of my good deeds or possessions."

(Psalms 10:39) 
For the saints who are on His earth, He has made all my desires wonderful in them, fulfilling His will through them.

(Psalms 10:40) 
The infirmities of those who worship other gods have multiplied; after this, they hastened to their ruin. I will not gather their assemblies of bloody sacrifices, nor will I remember their names with my lips.

(Psalms 11:1) 
This Psalm is for the End Times. A Psalm of David. I place my complete trust in the Lord. How can you say to my very soul: 'You must flee to the mountains, like a bird escaping a trap?'

(Psalms 11:2) 
For, just look at this: the wicked have strung their bows and are aiming. They have their arrows ready in their quivers. Their goal is to shoot, from the cover of darkness, those who are righteous in heart.

(Psalms 11:3) 
Because they have torn down everything good that You, O Lord, have established and perfected. When such things are destroyed, what good can the righteous do?

(Psalms 11:4) 
The Lord resides in His holy temple. The Lord has His throne in the universe. His eyes are observing the humble and the suffering, and His gaze carefully scrutinizes all humanity.

(Psalms 11:5) 
The Lord thoroughly investigates both the righteous and the wicked. But anyone who loves evil hates his own soul, condemning himself.

(Psalms 11:6) 
He will rain down snares upon the wicked: fire, burning sulfur, and the consuming winds of a tempest. This will be the cup of judgment they must drink.

(Psalms 11:7) 
Because the Lord is righteous, and He loves acts of justice and righteousness. His very face beholds and favors all that is equitable and right.

(Psalms 11:1) 
In the Lord I trust. How do you say to my very self: "Flee to the mountains like a sparrow?"

(Psalms 11:2) 
For behold, the wicked have aimed their bows; they have prepared their arrows in their quivers, so that in the darkness they may shoot at those who are upright in heart.

(Psalms 11:3) 
For the moral order you established, they have destroyed. But the righteous man, what has he done in response?

(Psalms 11:4) 
The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in His celestial dwelling.

(Psalms 11:5) 
His eyes look upon the poor; His eyelids scrutinize the children of men.

(Psalms 11:6) 
The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked; but His very being detests him who loves injustice.

(Psalms 11:7) 
He will rain down snares, fire, and brimstone upon sinners; and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.

(Psalms 11:8) 
For the Lord is righteous and loves acts of righteousness; His very presence beholds integrity.

(Psalms 12:1) 
This Psalm is for the ultimate fulfillment—a Psalm by David.

(Psalms 12:2) 
How long, O Lord? Will you forget me completely, forever? How long will you turn your face away from me?

(Psalms 12:3) 
How long must I bear worries in my soul and carry sorrow in my heart all day long?

(Psalms 12:4) 
How long will my enemy triumph over me?

(Psalms 12:5) 
Look on me and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I ever sleep the sleep of death:

(Psalms 12:6) 
Lest my enemy ever say, 'I have overcome him.' Those who trouble me will rejoice if I am shaken.

(Psalms 12:7) 
But I have hoped in your mercy. My heart will rejoice in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, who grants good things to me:

(Psalms 12:8) 
And I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.

(Psalms 12:1) 
A Psalm of David, for the ultimate purpose [of salvation], to be sung to the accompaniment of an eight-stringed instrument.

(Psalms 12:2) 
Save me, Lord, because the holy have grown few. Because true teachings have been diminished among all people.

(Psalms 12:3) 
They have spoken empty words, each one to their neighbor. With flattering lips and a deceitful heart, they spoke.

(Psalms 12:4) 
May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and every boastful tongue.

(Psalms 12:5) 
Those who say: 'We will make our mouths sound great! Our tongue is ours alone! Who is our master?'

(Psalms 12:6) 
Because of the misery of the needy and the groaning of the poor, now I will arise, says the Lord. I will place them in salvation. I will act confidently in it.

(Psalms 12:7) 
The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver tested by fire, purged of impurities from the earth seven times over.

(Psalms 12:8) 
You, Lord, will preserve us, and You will guard us from this generation forever.

(Psalms 12:9) 
How long, Lord? Will You forget me forever? How long will You turn Your face away from me?

(Psalms 12:10) 
How long must I put thoughts in my soul, and sorrow in my heart day after day?

(Psalms 12:11) 
How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

(Psalms 12:12) 
Look at me, and hear me, Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I ever fall asleep in death.

(Psalms 12:13) 
Lest my enemy ever say, 'I have prevailed against him.' My tormentors will rejoice if I am moved [from my position].

(Psalms 12:14) 
But I have hoped in Your mercy. My heart will rejoice in Your salvation. I will sing to the Lord who has granted me good things, and I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High.

(Psalms 12:15) 
A Psalm of David, for the ultimate purpose [of salvation]. The foolish one has said in his heart: 'There is no God.'

(Psalms 12:16) 
They have become corrupt, and abominable in their pursuits. There is no one who does good, not even one.

(Psalms 12:17) 
The Lord looked down from His dwelling place [the spiritual heaven] upon humanity, to see if there is anyone with understanding, or anyone seeking God.

(Psalms 12:18) 
All have turned aside. Together they have become useless. There is no one who does good, not even one.

(Psalms 12:19) 
Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues, they acted deceitfully. The poison of asps is under their lips.

(Psalms 12:20) 
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood.

(Psalms 12:21) 
Destruction and unhappiness are in their ways, and they have not known the path of peace. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

(Psalms 12:22) 
Will all those who work iniquity not know? Those who devour My people as if they were eating bread?

(Psalms 12:23) 
They have not called upon God. There they will tremble with fear, where there was no [natural] cause for fear.

(Psalms 12:24) 
For the Lord is with the just generation. You have confounded the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is their protector.

(Psalms 12:25) 
Who will bring salvation for Israel from Zion? When the Lord turns away the captivity of His people, Jacob will exult, and Israel will be glad.

(Psalms 12:26) 
A Psalm of David. Lord, who will live in Your tabernacle? Or who will rest on Your holy mountain?

(Psalms 12:27) 
He who walks without blemish, and works justice;

(Psalms 12:28) 
He who speaks truth in his heart, who has not acted deceitfully with his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbor, nor accepted reproach against his neighbors.

(Psalms 12:29) 
The wicked one is brought to nothing in his sight. But he glorifies those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and does not deceive;

(Psalms 12:30) 
He who has not lent his money at usury, and has not accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does these things will not be shaken forever.

(Psalms 12:31) 
A title inscription for David himself. Preserve me, Lord, because I have hoped in You.

(Psalms 12:32) 
I said to the Lord: 'You are my God, because You have no need of my good things [my merits].'

(Psalms 12:33) 
To the saints who are on His land, He has fulfilled all my desires in them [through His grace and their intercession].

(Psalms 12:34) 
Their weaknesses have multiplied; afterwards, they hastened. I will not gather their assemblies of bloodshed, nor will I remember their names with my lips.

(Psalms 12:35) 
The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup. You are the one who will restore my inheritance to me.

(Psalms 12:36) 
The boundary lines have fallen for me in beautiful places. Indeed, my inheritance is beautiful to me.

(Psalms 12:37) 
I will bless the Lord, who has given me understanding. Moreover, even throughout the night, my innermost being [literally 'kidneys'] has instructed me.

I kept the Lord before my sight always, because He is at my right hand, so that I may not be shaken.

(Psalms 12:39) 
Because of this, my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. Moreover, my flesh will rest in hope.

(Psalms 17:12) 
Before the brightness of His presence, the clouds passed away, followed by hail and burning coals.

(Psalms 17:13) 
And the Lord thundered from the skies, and the Most High uttered His voice: hail and burning coals.

(Psalms 17:42) 
And I will crush them like dust before the wind; I will cast them out like the mud of the streets.

(Psalms 17:43) 
You will rescue me from the strife of the people; You will make me the head of nations. A people I have not known have served me.

(Psalms 35:14)

(Psalms 35:15)

(Psalms 36:1) 
How long, O Lord, will you completely forget me? How long will you turn your face away from me?

(Psalms 36:2) 
How long will I be forced to consider my anguish in my soul, and my pain in my heart every day?

(Psalms 36:3) 
How long will my enemy have power over me? Consider this, and hear me, O Lord my God.

For you will save a humble people, and you will bring down the eyes of the proud.

(Psalms 36:15) 
For you will light my lamp, O Lord my God; illuminate my darkness.

(Psalms 36:16) 
For I will be rescued from the temptation in you, and in my God I will cross over the wall.

(Psalms 36:17) 
God's way is immaculate. The words of the Lord are tested by fire; He is the protector of all who hope in Him.

(Psalms 36:18) 
Who is God besides the Lord? Or who is God except our God?

(Psalms 36:19) 
God, who has armed me with virtue, and has made my way immaculate.

(Psalms 36:20) 
Who has made my feet like the feet of the deer, and has established me on high places.

(Psalms 36:21) 
Who teaches my hands for battle, and you have made my arms like a bronze bow.

(Psalms 36:23) 
You have enlarged my steps beneath me, and my footsteps have not weakened.

(Psalms 36:24) 
I will pursue my enemies and I will comprehend them; and I will not turn back until they are finished.

(Psalms 36:25) 
I will shatter them, and they will not be able to stand; they will fall beneath my feet.

(Psalms 36:26) 
And you have girded me with virtue for battle; and you have made those who rise against me to stumble.

(Psalms 36:27) 
And you have given my enemies their backs to me, and you have destroyed those who hate me.

(Psalms 36:28) 
They cried out, and there was no one to save them; to the Lord, and he did not hear them.

(Psalms 36:29) 
And I will crush them like dust before the face of the wind. I will trample them like the mud of the streets.

(Psalms 36:30) 
You will rescue me from the contradictions of the people; you will establish me as the head of the Gentiles.

(Psalms 36:31) 
A people I do not know has served me; at the hearing of the ear, they have obeyed me.

(Psalms 36:32) 
Foreign children have lied to me; foreign children have grown old, and they have faltered from their paths.

(Psalms 36:33) 
The Lord lives, and blessed is my God, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

(Psalms 36:34) 
God, who gives me vengeance, and subjects the peoples under me.

(Psalms 36:35) 
My liberator from my wrathful enemies. You will exalt me from those who rise up against me; you will rescue me from the wicked man.

(Psalms 36:36) 
Therefore, I will confess to you among the Gentiles, O Lord; and I will sing a psalm to your name.

(Psalms 36:37) 
Magnifying the saving acts of his King, and showing mercy to his Christ, David, and to his seed forever.

Because those who do evil will be destroyed, but those who trust in the Lord will inherit the land.

Because the Lord loves justice and will not forsake His saints; they will be preserved forever.

(Psalms 37:29) 
The wicked will be punished, and the seed of the impious will perish.

(Psalms 37:30) 
But the righteous will inherit the land and will dwell on it forever.

(Psalms 37:31) 
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks of justice.

(Psalms 37:32) 
The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps will not be tripped up.

(Psalms 37:33) 
The sinner watches the righteous and seeks to kill him.

(Psalms 37:34) 
But the Lord will not leave him in his hands nor condemn him when he is judged.

(Psalms 37:35) 
Wait for the Lord and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; you will see when the sinners are destroyed.

(Psalms 37:36) 
I have seen the wicked exalted and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon.

(Psalms 37:37) 
Then I passed by, and behold, he was gone; I searched for him, but his place could not be found.

(Psalms 37:38) 
Guard innocence and look to integrity, because there is a future for the man of peace.

(Psalms 37:39) 
But the wicked will perish together, and the future of the impious will be destroyed.

(Psalms 37:40) 
But the salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord, and He is their protector in the time of tribulation.

(Psalms 37:41) 
And the Lord will help them and deliver them; He will rescue them from the sinners and save them, because they have hoped in Him.

(Psalms 38:1) 
Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor correct me in your wrath.

(Psalms 38:2) 
Because your arrows have struck me, and your hand has pressed down upon me.

(Psalms 38:3) 
My body is in pain because of your anger, and my bones have no rest because of my sins.

(Psalms 38:4) 
My sins have overwhelmed me; they are a heavy burden, too heavy for me to bear.

(Psalms 38:5) 
My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.

(Psalms 38:6) 
I am bowed down and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.

(Psalms 38:7) 
My loins are filled with fever, and there is no health in my body.

(Psalms 38:8) 
I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan because of the anguish of my heart.

(Psalms 38:9) 
Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you.

(Psalms 38:10) 
My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light of my eyes is gone from me.

(Psalms 38:11) 
My friends and companions avoid me because of my affliction; my neighbors stand far off.

(Psalms 38:12) 
Those who seek my life set traps for me, those who want to harm me speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.

(Psalms 38:13) 
But I, like the deaf, do not hear; I am like the mute, who cannot open his mouth.

(Psalms 38:14) 
I am like one who does not hear, whose mouth cannot offer a retort.

(Psalms 38:15) 
I wait for you, Lord; you will answer, Lord my God.

(Psalms 38:16) 
I said, “Do not let them gloat over me, those who triumph when my foot slips.”

(Psalms 38:17) 
For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.

(Psalms 38:18) 
I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.

(Psalms 38:19) 
My enemies are vigorous, and those who hate me without cause are numerous.

(Psalms 38:20) 
Those who repay good with evil, they slander me for pursuing good.

(Psalms 38:21) 
Do not forsake me, Lord; do not be far from me, my God.

(Psalms 38:22) 
Come quickly to help me, O Lord, my Savior.

(Psalms 39:1) 
I said: “I will keep myself from sin, so that I do not sin with my words.” I put a watch over my mouth when wicked men were present, speaking against me.

(Psalms 39:2) 
I was silent, and humbled myself, and held my tongue, even from doing good. But my pain was renewed.

(Psalms 39:3) 
My heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation, a fire blazed up.

(Psalms 39:4) 
I spoke then with my tongue: “Show me, Lord, what is my end, and what is the number of my days, so that I might know what I truly lack.”

(Psalms 39:5) 
Behold, you have measured out my days, and my substance is as nothing before you. Yes, every man living is mere vanity.

(Psalms 39:6) 
Truly, man walks about as a shadow, and he is troubled in vain. He gathers riches but doesn't know who will possess them.

(Psalms 39:7) 
And now, what is my expectation? Is it not the Lord? And my hope is in you.

(Psalms 39:8) 
Deliver me from all my iniquities. Do not make me a disgrace to the foolish.

(Psalms 39:9) 
I was silent and did not open my mouth, because you have done this.

(Psalms 39:10) 
Remove your plagues from me. I am worn out by the power of your hand.

(Psalms 39:11) 
With rebuke, you have corrected man for iniquity. And like a moth, you have made his soul waste away. Yet, every man is but vanity.

(Psalms 39:12) 
Hear my prayer, Lord, and heed my supplication. Give ear to my tears. Do not be silent, for I am a stranger before you and a pilgrim like all my fathers.

(Psalms 39:13) 
Forgive me, that I may be refreshed before I go away and be seen no more.

(Psalms 40:1) 
I waited and waited on the Lord, and He turned to me.

(Psalms 40:2) 
He heard my prayers and took me out of the pit of misery and the mud of the swamp.

(Psalms 40:3) 
He set my feet on solid ground, and made my steps sure.

(Psalms 40:4) 
He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn to our God.

(Psalms 40:5) 
Many will see and be afraid, and then they will trust in the Lord.

(Psalms 40:6) 
Blessed is the man whose trust is in the Lord, and who has not looked at vanity and false madness.

(Psalms 40:7) 
O Lord my God, You have done many wonderful things, and no one can match Your thoughts.

(Psalms 40:8) 
I have proclaimed them, and spoken them, and they have multiplied beyond number.

(Psalms 40:9) 
You didn't want sacrifices or offerings; rather, you have perfected my ears.

(Psalms 40:10) 
You didn't ask for burnt offerings or sacrifices for sin, so I said, “Behold, I come.”

(Psalms 40:11) 
It is written of me in the book: “I want to do Your will, O my God, and Your law is within my heart.”

(Psalms 40:12) 
I have proclaimed Your justice in the great assembly; behold, I do not restrain my lips; O Lord, You know this.

(Psalms 40:13) 
I have not hidden Your justice in my heart; I have proclaimed Your truth and Your salvation.

(Psalms 40:14) 
I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great multitude.

(Psalms 40:15) 
Don’t withhold Your mercy from me, O Lord; Your mercy and truth have always protected me.

(Psalms 40:16) 
For evils without number have surrounded me; my sins have overtaken me, and I can’t see a way out.

(Psalms 40:17) 
They are more than the hairs on my head, those who hate me without cause.

(Psalms 40:18) 
Those who persecute me are strengthened, my unjust enemies; I was made to pay for what I did not steal.

(Psalms 40:19) 
O God, don’t be far from me; my God, look upon me to help me.

(Psalms 40:20) 
Let them be ashamed and disgraced, all who seek my life to take it away.

(Psalms 40:21) 
Let those who wish me evil turn back and be ashamed.

(Psalms 40:22) 
Let them be brought to immediate shame, those who say to me, “Well done, well done!”

(Psalms 40:23) 
Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation always say, “May the Lord be glorified!”

(Psalms 40:24) 
But I am poor and needy; the Lord cares for me.

(Psalms 40:25) 
You are my helper and my protector; O my God, don’t delay.

(Psalms 41:1) 
To the end, for David, in memory.

(Psalms 41:2) 
Happy is the person who cares for the needy. In the day of evil, the Lord will free him.

(Psalms 41:3) 
May the Lord preserve him, and may the Lord make him live. May He bless him upon the earth, and may He not give him over to the will of his enemies.

(Psalms 41:4) 
May the Lord assist him on his bed of suffering. You have turned over the entire bed for him in his weakness.

(Psalms 41:5) 
I said, "Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, because I have sinned against You."

(Psalms 41:6) 
My enemies spoke evil against me. "When will he die, and when will his name perish?"

(Psalms 41:7) 
And if he was entering to see me, he spoke in vain. His heart gathered iniquity for himself.

(Psalms 41:8) 
He was cast out, and he spoke in the same way.

(Psalms 41:9) 
All my enemies whispered against me. They were thinking up evil against me.

(Psalms 41:10) 
They have planned an unjust word against me. "Does he who is sleeping not add to rise again?"

(Psalms 41:11) 
For even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, who ate my bread, greatly lifted his heel against me.

(Psalms 41:12) 
But You, Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up that I may repay them.

(Psalms 41:13) 
By this, I have known that You have wanted me, because my enemy will not rejoice over me.

(Psalms 41:14) 
But You have upheld me because of my innocence, and You have confirmed me in Your sight forever.

(Psalms 41:15) 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from all eternity to eternity. So be it, so be it.

(Psalms 42:1) 
Like a deer thirsting for water, my soul thirsts for You, O God.

(Psalms 42:2) 
My soul thirsts for the living God;

(Psalms 42:3) 
When will I come and appear before the face of God?

(Psalms 42:4) 
My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say to me daily: "Where is your God?"

(Psalms 42:5) 
I remember these things, and I pour out my soul within me:

(Psalms 42:6) 
How I used to walk in the temple, as if to the house of God, among the sound of joy and thanksgiving, with a crowd celebrating a feast.

(Psalms 42:7) 
Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me?

(Psalms 42:8) 
Hope in God, for I will still give praise to Him, the saving presence of my countenance.

(Psalms 42:9) 
My God, my soul is troubled within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan and of Hermon and from the little mountain.

(Psalms 42:10) 
Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls;

(Psalms 42:11) 
all your exalted waves and your billows have passed over me.

(Psalms 42:12) 
By day the Lord commands his mercy, and at night his song.

(Psalms 42:13) 
Let my prayer go to the God of my life, and I will say:

(Psalms 42:14) 
“Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go about sad, while the enemy afflicts me?”

(Psalms 42:15) 
As my bones are broken, the enemies who afflict me have reproached me.

(Psalms 42:16) 
As they say to me daily: "Where is your God?"

(Psalms 42:17) 
Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me?

(Psalms 42:18) 
Hope in God, for I will still give praise to Him, my salvation, and my God.

(Psalms 43:1) 
Give me justice, O God, and defend my cause from a nation that isn’t holy. Deliver me from the hands of wicked and deceitful people.

(Psalms 43:2) 
For You are the God who protects me: why have you rejected me? Why do I walk around so sad and downtrodden when my enemies are constantly bothering me?

(Psalms 43:3) 
Send forth Your light and Your truth. Those things have guided me, and lead me back up to your holy mountain, and to Your tabernacles.

(Psalms 43:4) 
Then I will go to the altar of God: to God, who gives joy to my youth.

(Psalms 43:5) 
I will give thanks to You with a harp, O God, my God. Why are you sad, my soul? Why do you disturb me?

(Psalms 43:6) 
Hope in God, because I will still give Him thanks. He is the salvation of my face, and He is my God.

(Psalms 44:1) 
For the leader. A song for the sons of Korah, a prayer for understanding.

(Psalms 44:2) 
Listen to this, all you nations. Understand this, all who live on Earth.

(Psalms 44:3) 
Consider this, you who are of the earth, and all the sons of men. Both rich and poor come together, for all are equal.

(Psalms 44:4) 
My mouth will speak wisdom, and my heart will ponder prudence.

(Psalms 44:5) 
I will listen closely to a parable. I will solve the mystery by singing a song.

(Psalms 44:6) 
Why should I fear trouble? The wickedness of my life seeks to surround me.

(Psalms 44:7) 
They trust in their own strength, and boast in the abundance of their riches.

(Psalms 44:8) 
No man can pay the price to save a brother. Man cannot give God the price of redemption.

(Psalms 44:9) 
For he cannot pay to satisfy God's justice, nor give enough to save his own soul.

(Psalms 44:10) 
For he will labor forever, and continue to live in his misery without end.

(Psalms 44:11) 
He will not see corruption, when he sees wise men dying. The fool and the stupid will perish together.

(Psalms 44:12) 
And they leave their riches to others.

(Psalms 44:13) 
Their tombs will be their houses forever. Their dwellings will be from generation to generation.

(Psalms 44:14) 
They have given names to the lands which they possess.

(Psalms 44:15) 
But man, though living in honor, does not understand. He is compared to unthinking beasts, and becomes like them.

(Psalms 44:16) 
This is the way of them that cause trouble. Their mouths approve of their own wickedness.

(Psalms 44:17) 
Like sheep in the grave, death will feed on them.

(Psalms 44:18) 
The just shall rule over them at the resurrection, and their strength will waste away in the grave, far from their glory.

(Psalms 44:19) 
But God will redeem my soul from the power of hell, for He will receive me.

(Psalms 44:20) 
Do not fear when a man becomes rich, or when the glory of his house is increased.

(Psalms 44:21) 
For when he dies, he will take nothing. His glory will not follow him down.

(Psalms 44:22) 
Because his soul, while he lives, is blessed. He will give thanks to You when You bless him.

(Psalms 44:23) 
He will go to the generation of his fathers. And he will never again see the light.

(Psalms 44:24) 
Man, while living in honor, does not understand. He is compared to unthinking beasts, and becomes like them.

(Psalms 45:1) 
My heart swells with a message from God. I will write my poem to the King.

(Psalms 45:2) 
My tongue will be like the ready pen of a skilled writer.

(Psalms 45:3) 
You are the fairest of all men. Grace is poured out on your lips, and God has blessed you forever.

(Psalms 45:4) 
Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one.

(Psalms 45:5) 
In your glory and your beauty, ride forth, and reign.

(Psalms 45:6) 
Ride forth for truth, gentleness, and righteousness. Let your right hand perform awesome deeds.

(Psalms 45:7) 
Your arrows are sharp, and nations will fall before you, piercing the hearts of the king's enemies.

(Psalms 45:8) 
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.

(Psalms 45:9) 
You love justice and hate wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.

(Psalms 45:10) 
Your robes are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia; from the ivory palaces, stringed instruments make you rejoice.

(Psalms 45:11) 
Daughters of kings are among those held in honor; the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with gold from Ophir.

(Psalms 45:12) 
Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house.

(Psalms 45:13) 
And the king will desire your beauty; he is your lord, and you shall bow down to him.

(Psalms 45:14) 
The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts; the rich among the people will seek your blessing.

(Psalms 45:15) 
All glorious is the princess within; her gown is woven with gold.

(Psalms 45:16) 
In embroidered garments she is led to the king; after her the virgins, her companions, are brought to you.

(Psalms 45:17) 
They are led forth with gladness and rejoicing; they enter the palace of the king.

(Psalms 45:18) 
Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout all the earth.

(Psalms 45:19) 
I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations;

(Psalms 45:20) 
therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.

(Psalms 46:1) 
A song for the liturgical use of the sons of Korah, for the soul.

(Psalms 46:2) 
God is our safe-haven and His power is our strength. He is the help we need during the tribulations that have found us.

(Psalms 46:3) 
Therefore, we will not fear even when the earth is shaken. Even if the mountains are moved into the depths of the sea...

(Psalms 46:4) 
Their waters have roared and foamed over; the mountains have trembled and been disturbed by His strength.

(Psalms 46:5) 
The rush of the river brings joy to the city of God. The Most High sanctified His tabernacle.

(Psalms 46:6) 
God is in the midst of the city, and it will not be moved. God will help it, even at the break of dawn.

(Psalms 46:7) 
The nations were troubled and the kingdoms were inclined. God spoke, and the earth was moved.

(Psalms 46:8) 
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our protector.

(Psalms 46:9) 
Come and see the works of the Lord, the amazing things He has done on Earth.

(Psalms 46:10) 
He stops wars all over the Earth. He breaks the bow, shatters the spear, and burns the shields in the fire.

(Psalms 46:11) 
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.

(Psalms 46:12) 
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our protector.

(Psalms 47:1) 
For the leader. A song. The sons of Korah composed this.

(Psalms 47:2) 
All nations, clap your hands; sing praises to God with a voice of joy.

(Psalms 47:3) 
For the Lord is high and to be feared. He is the great king over all the land.

(Psalms 47:4) 
He subdued the people to us, and the nations under our feet.

(Psalms 47:5) 
He chose our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved.

(Psalms 47:6) 
God ascends amid shouts of joy, and the Lord, with the sound of the trumpet.

(Psalms 47:7) 
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our king, sing praises.

(Psalms 47:8) 
For God is king of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.

(Psalms 47:9) 
God reigns over all nations; God sits upon his holy throne.

(Psalms 47:10) 
The princes of the people have gathered together with the God of Abraham. For the strong ones of the land are greatly exalted in their time.

(Psalms 48:1) 
A song of the psalms, for the sons of Korah. The Lord is great, and worthy of all praise: in the city of our God, on his holy mountain.

(Psalms 48:2) 
It is beautiful, the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, and the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

(Psalms 48:3) 
God is known in His houses, when He shall take her.

(Psalms 48:4) 
For, behold, the kings of the earth are gathered: they have come together.

(Psalms 48:5) 
They saw, and so they marveled; they were troubled, they were moved.

(Psalms 48:6) 
Trembling took hold of them: there were pains like a woman in labor.

(Psalms 48:7) 
With a strong wind, You will break the ships of Tarshish.

(Psalms 48:8) 
As we have heard, so have we seen: in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded her forever.

(Psalms 48:9) 
We have received, O God, Your mercy, in the midst of You.

(Psalms 48:10) 
According to Your name, O God, so also is Your praise to the ends of the earth: Your right hand is full of justice.

(Psalms 48:11) 
Let Mount Zion rejoice, and let the daughters of Judah exult: because of Your judgments, O Lord.

(Psalms 48:12) 
Go around Zion, and go around her: tell of her towers.

(Psalms 48:13) 
Set your hearts on her power: and distribute it in her towers, that you may tell it in another generation.

(Psalms 48:14) 
For this is God, our God forever, and for ages of ages: He will rule us forever.

(Psalms 49:1) 
Listen to this, all you people;

(Psalms 49:2) 
listen carefully, all who dwell on earth:

(Psalms 49:3) 
people of all classes, people of all kinds, the wealthy and the poor.

(Psalms 49:4) 
My mouth will declare wisdom;

(Psalms 49:5) 
and the meditation of my heart will be prudence.

(Psalms 49:6) 
I will incline my ear to a parable;

(Psalms 49:7) 
I will open my proposition in the psalter.

(Psalms 49:8) 
Why will I be afraid in the evil day? The iniquity of my heel will surround me.

(Psalms 49:9) 
They trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches.

(Psalms 49:10) 
A brother will not redeem, nor will a man redeem, nor give to God his ransom,

(Psalms 49:11) 
nor the price of the redemption of his soul.

(Psalms 49:12) 
And he will labor in eternity, and will live forever.

(Psalms 49:13) 
For he will not see corruption when he sees the wise dying;

(Psalms 49:14) 
at the same time, the foolish and the stupid will perish: and they will leave their riches to others.

(Psalms 49:15) 
And their sepulchers are their homes forever, their tabernacles from generation to generation.

(Psalms 49:16) 
They set their tongues, and they called the lands by their names.

(Psalms 49:17) 
And man, when he was in honor, did not understand.

(Psalms 49:18) 
He is compared to the irrational beasts, and made similar to them.

(Psalms 49:19) 
This is their way: it is a scandal to them: and afterwards they will be pleased in their mouth.

(Psalms 49:20) 
As sheep are placed in hell: death will feed on them. And the just will rule over them in the morning: and their help will be consumed by old age in hell.

(Psalms 49:21) 
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he receives me.

(Psalms 49:22) 
Do not fear when he becomes rich, and when the glory of his house is multiplied.

(Psalms 49:23) 
For when he dies, he will take nothing.

(Psalms 49:24) 
And his glory will not descend with him.

(Psalms 49:25) 
Because his soul will be blessed in his life.

(Psalms 49:26) 
He will confess to you when you receive, and you will repay him.

(Psalms 49:27) 
He will enter into the generation of his fathers: he will never see the light.

(Psalms 49:28) 
Man, when he was in honor, did not understand: he is compared to the irrational beasts, and made similar to them.

(Psalms 50:1) 
Have mercy on me, God, according to Your mercy.

(Psalms 50:2) 
And according to the abundance of Your compassion, erase my iniquity.

(Psalms 50:3) 
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

(Psalms 50:4) 
For I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.

(Psalms 50:5) 
Against You alone have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be justified in Your words, and prevail when You are judged.

(Psalms 50:6) 
For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me.

(Psalms 50:7) 
Behold, You have desired truth; You have made known to me the uncertain and hidden things of Your wisdom.

(Psalms 50:8) 
You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; You will wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

(Psalms 50:9) 
You will give me joy and gladness; and the bones that were humbled shall rejoice.

(Psalms 50:10) 
Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

(Psalms 50:11) 
Create a clean heart in me, God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

(Psalms 50:12) 
Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

(Psalms 50:13) 
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and strengthen me with a willing spirit.

(Psalms 50:14) 
Then I will teach the wicked Your ways, and sinners will be converted to You.

(Psalms 50:15) 
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will rejoice in Your justice.

(Psalms 50:16) 
O Lord, You will open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.

(Psalms 50:17) 
For if You had desired sacrifice, I would have given it; You will not delight in burnt offerings.

(Psalms 50:18) 
The sacrifice for God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled heart, God, You will not despise.

(Psalms 50:19) 
Be gracious, O Lord, in Your good pleasure to Zion, that the walls of Jerusalem may be rebuilt.

(Psalms 50:20) 
Then You will accept the sacrifice of justice, offerings, and burnt offerings; then they will place young bulls upon Your altar.

(Psalms 51:1) 
Have mercy on me, O God, because of Your great mercy.

(Psalms 51:2) 
And because of Your compassion, wipe away my iniquity.

(Psalms 51:3) 
Wash me completely from my sin and cleanse me.

(Psalms 51:4) 
Because I know my iniquities, my sins are always before me.

(Psalms 51:5) 
I have sinned against You alone, and done what is evil in Your eyes, so that You are just in Your sentence, and righteous in Your judgment.

(Psalms 51:6) 
Behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

(Psalms 51:7) 
Indeed, You love truth in the heart; You have made known to me the secrets of Your wisdom.

(Psalms 51:8) 
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

(Psalms 51:9) 
Make me hear joy and gladness; that the bones You have crushed may rejoice.

(Psalms 51:10) 
Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.

(Psalms 51:11) 
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

(Psalms 51:12) 
Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

(Psalms 51:13) 
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.

(Psalms 51:14) 
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.

(Psalms 51:15) 
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.

(Psalms 51:16) 
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim Your praise.

(Psalms 51:17) 
For You do not delight in sacrifice; You would accept a burnt offering.

(Psalms 51:18) 
My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

(Psalms 51:19) 
Be pleased to do good to Zion in Your good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

(Psalms 51:20) 
Then You will be pleased with sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then they will offer bulls on Your altar.

(Psalms 52:1) 
For the director of music. A Psalm of David, reflecting deep sorrow.

(Psalms 52:2) 
The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”

(Psalms 52:3) 
They are corrupt. They have done detestable deeds, none of them does good.

(Psalms 52:4) 
God looks down from the sky on humankind, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.

(Psalms 52:5) 
Everyone has turned away, together they have become useless; no one does good, not even one.

(Psalms 52:6) 
Do all those evildoers not know? They devour my people as though they were bread.

(Psalms 52:7) 
They do not call on God.

(Psalms 52:8) 
They were in great fear, though there was no reason to fear, because God scattered the bones of those who pleased humanity. They were shamed, because God rejected them.

(Psalms 52:9) 
Who will bring salvation for Israel from Zion? When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad.

(Psalms 53:1) 
To the end. A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 53:2) 
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."

(Psalms 53:3) 
They have become corrupt; they have become abominable in their wickedness. There is no one who does good.

(Psalms 53:4) 
God looked down from the sky upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood, or sought God.

(Psalms 53:5) 
All have turned aside; they have together become useless. There is none who does good, not even one.

(Psalms 53:6) 
Will they not know, all who work iniquity, who devour my people as if they were bread?

(Psalms 53:7) 
They have not called upon God.

(Psalms 53:8) 
There they trembled with fear where there was no fear.

(Psalms 53:9) 
For God has scattered the bones of those who please men; they are confused, because God has despised them.

(Psalms 53:10) 
Who will give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God returns the captivity of his people, Jacob will rejoice, and Israel will be glad.

(Psalms 54:1) 
For the leader. A song of contemplation by David.

(Psalms 54:2) 
Hear me, God, and listen to my prayer, and do not look away from my supplication.

(Psalms 54:3) 
Pay attention to me, and hear me. I am troubled in my thoughts, and I am disturbed

(Psalms 54:4) 
by the voice of the enemy, and by the oppression of the sinner.

(Psalms 54:5) 
For they have poured wickedness upon me, and they were angry with me.

(Psalms 54:6) 
My heart is troubled within me, and the fear of death has fallen upon me.

(Psalms 54:7) 
Fear and trembling have come upon me, and darkness has covered me.

(Psalms 54:8) 
And I said: “Who will give me wings like a dove, so I can fly away, and be at rest?”

(Psalms 54:9) 
Behold, I have fled far away and remained in the wilderness.

(Psalms 54:10) 
I was waiting for Him to save me from the spirit of the storm and the tempest.

(Psalms 54:11) 
Hasten, Lord; divide their tongues; for I have seen wickedness and contradiction in the city.

(Psalms 54:12) 
Day and night, wickedness surrounds it on its walls, and trouble is in its midst.

(Psalms 54:13) 
Wickedness is in the midst of it, and deceit and fraud never depart from its streets.

(Psalms 54:14) 
For it was not an enemy who reproached me, and I would have borne it. If he who hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself.

(Psalms 54:15) 
But it was you, a man of one mind with me, my guide and my acquaintance.

(Psalms 54:16) 
Together, we took pleasure in food. We walked in the house of God with agreement.

(Psalms 54:17) 
Let death come upon them, and let them go down to hell alive, for wickedness is in their dwellings, in their midst.

(Psalms 54:18) 
But I cried out to God, and the Lord will save me.

(Psalms 54:19) 
In the evening, in the morning, and at noon, I will tell and announce it. And He will hear my voice.

(Psalms 54:20) 
He will redeem my soul in peace from those who call me. For they were with me, though they are many.

(Psalms 54:21) 
May God hear and humble them—He who is before the ages. For there is no change in them, and they did not fear God.

(Psalms 54:22) 
He stretched out his hand to repay. They have defiled His covenant.

(Psalms 54:23) 
They were separated from the wrath of His countenance, and their hearts drew near.

(Psalms 54:24) 
His words are softer than oil, but they are weapons.

(Psalms 54:25) 
Cast your care upon the Lord, and He will nourish you. He will not give the just to be in a perpetual state of fluctuation.

(Psalms 54:26) 
But you, God, will lead them into the pit of destruction. Men of blood and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in you, Lord.

(Psalms 55:1) 
For the leader. A song of David.

(Psalms 55:2) 
Listen, O God, to my prayer. Don’t ignore my supplication.

(Psalms 55:3) 
Hear me and answer me. I am troubled by my worries, and I am disturbed.

(Psalms 55:4) 
Because of the enemy’s voice, and the sinner’s tribulation.

(Psalms 55:5) 
Because they have brought unjust accusations against me. The sinners are so angry at me.

(Psalms 55:6) 
My heart is troubled within me, and the terror of death has fallen on me.

(Psalms 55:7) 
Fear and trembling have come upon me, and darkness has covered me.

(Psalms 55:8) 
And I said: “Who will give me the wings of a dove, so I can fly away and find rest?”

(Psalms 55:9) 
Behold, I have fled far away, and I dwell in the desert.

(Psalms 55:10) 
I was waiting for the one who would save me from the spirit of storm and from a tempest.

(Psalms 55:11) 
Lord, command this: destroy them, and divide their tongues.

(Psalms 55:12) 
Because I see injustice and discord in the city.

(Psalms 55:13) 
Day and night injustice will surround its walls.

(Psalms 55:14) 
And in its midst is labor, and iniquity, and in its streets deceit and fraud will never depart.

(Psalms 55:15) 
For if my enemy had cursed me, I would surely have endured it.

(Psalms 55:16) 
And if the one who hated me had spoken great things against me, I would have perhaps hidden myself from him.

(Psalms 55:17) 
But you, a man of my own heart, my leader, and my acquaintance,

(Psalms 55:18) 
who together shared pleasant food; we walked in the house of God with harmony.

(Psalms 55:19) 
Let death come upon them, and let them descend alive into hell: because wickedness is in their dwellings, in their midst.

(Psalms 55:20) 
But I cried out to God, and the Lord will save me.

(Psalms 55:21) 
Evening, morning, and noon I will tell the story, and I will announce it: and He will hear my voice.

(Psalms 55:22) 
He will redeem my soul in peace from those who approach me: because there were many against me.

(Psalms 55:23) 
May God hear and humble them, He who exists from before the ages.

(Psalms 55:24) 
For there is no change for them, and they have not feared God.

(Psalms 55:25) 
He stretched out his hand in retaliation; he profaned His covenant.

(Psalms 55:26) 
They were divided by the anger of His countenance: and they approached His heart.

(Psalms 55:27) 
His words were smoother than oil: and they themselves are like arrows.

(Psalms 55:28) 
Cast your care upon the Lord, and He will nourish you: He will not allow the just to be shaken forever.

(Psalms 55:29) 
But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction: men of blood and deceit will not live out their days. But I will hope in you, O Lord.

(Psalms 56:1) 
Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusts in you.

(Psalms 56:2) 
I will hope in the shadow of your wings until iniquity passes.

(Psalms 56:3) 
I will cry to the most high God: the God who has done good things for me.

(Psalms 56:4) 
He sent from the sky, and freed me: He gave them to be mocked.

(Psalms 56:5) 
God has sent his mercy and his truth.

(Psalms 56:6) 
And he delivered my soul from the midst of lions: I slept, troubled.

(Psalms 56:7) 
The sons of men are armed with teeth, arrows, and a sharp sword of the tongue.

(Psalms 56:8) 
Be exalted above the heavens, God, and let your glory be in all the earth.

(Psalms 56:9) 
They have caught my foot: they have afflicted my soul.

(Psalms 56:10) 
They have thrown my soul into a pit.

(Psalms 56:11) 
You have paid attention to me, Lord God.

(Psalms 56:12) 
Awake, and arise, and rise up, my glory.

(Psalms 56:13) 
I will arise to you: because you are my God.

(Psalms 56:14) 
I will give praise to you in the people, Lord: and I will sing psalms to you in the nations.

(Psalms 56:15) 
Because your mercy has been magnified up to the sky: and your truth is up to the clouds.

(Psalms 56:16) 
Be exalted above the heavens, God.

(Psalms 57:1) 
Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me. I put my trust in You.

(Psalms 57:2) 
I take refuge in the shadow of Your protection until this trial passes.

(Psalms 57:3) 
I will call to God, the Most High; to God who gave me good things.

(Psalms 57:4) 
He will send help from the sky, and He will deliver me. He will make them ashamed, those who want to destroy me.

(Psalms 57:5) 
God sent down His mercy and His truth.

(Psalms 57:6) 
He rescued my soul from the lions. I was in a state of distress and couldn't sleep.

(Psalms 57:7) 
They are children of men, but their teeth are like weapons, and their tongues are like sharp swords.

(Psalms 57:8) 
Be exalted, God, above the sky! Let Your glory fill the whole land.

(Psalms 57:9) 
They prepared a trap for my feet and tried to break my spirit.

(Psalms 57:10) 
They dug a pit for me, but they fell into it themselves.

(Psalms 57:11) 
My heart is ready, God; my heart is ready. I will sing and praise You.

(Psalms 57:12) 
Wake up, my soul! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the sun.

(Psalms 57:13) 
I will thank You among the peoples, Lord; I will sing Your praises among the nations.

(Psalms 57:14) 
For Your mercy is as great as the sky, and Your truth reaches to the clouds.

(Psalms 57:15) 
Be exalted, God, above the sky; let Your glory cover the whole land.

(Psalms 58:1) 
For the director of music; do not destroy. A psalm of David.

(Psalms 58:2) 
Do you really know how to speak justly? Judge what is right, sons of men.

(Psalms 58:3) 
You have evil in your hearts. Violence is your work in the land.

(Psalms 58:4) 
The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray from their birth, speaking lies.

(Psalms 58:5) 
Their venom is like the poison of a snake. They are like a deaf viper, blocking its ears.

(Psalms 58:6) 
It will not listen to the voice of charmers, or of a skilled enchanter.

(Psalms 58:7) 
Break their teeth in their mouths, O God. Lord, break the fangs of the lions.

(Psalms 58:8) 
Let them vanish like water flowing away. Let them be crushed before their arrows are released.

(Psalms 58:9) 
Let them be like the wax that melts away. Let fire fall upon them; let them not see the sun.

(Psalms 58:10) 
So that before your thorns can grow into a thicket, let the living be swept away in wrath.

(Psalms 58:11) 
The just man will rejoice when he sees revenge. He will wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.

(Psalms 58:12) 
Then men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the just." Surely God judges those on earth.

(Psalms 59:1) 
To the end, lest thou destroy, a song of David, in the inscription of the title, when he burnt Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria of Soba, and Joab returned, and smote in the valley of salt twelve thousand.

(Psalms 59:2) 
O God, you rejected us and broke us: you were angry, and showed mercy to us.

(Psalms 59:3) 
You have disturbed the land, and have shaken it: heal the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.

(Psalms 59:4) 
You have shewn your people hard things: you have given us to drink of the wine of sorrow.

(Psalms 59:5) 
You have given a sign to those who fear you, that they may flee from before the bow.

(Psalms 59:6) 
That your beloved ones may be delivered: save me with your right hand, and hear me.

(Psalms 59:7) 
God spoke in his holy place: I will rejoice and divide Sichem, and measure out the valley of the tabernacles.

(Psalms 59:8) 
Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength of my head.

(Psalms 59:9) 
Judah is my king: Moab is the pot of my hope.

(Psalms 59:10) 
In Idumea I will extend my shoe: to me the strangers are made friends.

(Psalms 59:11) 
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will bring me into Idumea?

(Psalms 59:12) 
Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? and will not you, O God, go forth with our powers?

(Psalms 59:13) 
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the salvation of man.

(Psalms 59:14) 
In God we will do great things: and he will tread down our enemies.

(Psalms 60:1) 
To the end, for those who will change. Of David. In the doctrine when he set on fire the Syrians of Mesopotamia and Syria of Soba: and Joab returned, and struck in the valley of Salt twelve thousand.

(Psalms 60:2) 
O God, you have rejected us, and have destroyed us; You were angry, but now You have had mercy on us.

(Psalms 60:3) 
You have moved the earth and troubled it. Heal its fractures, for it is shaken.

(Psalms 60:4) 
You have shown Your people harsh things; You have given us to drink the wine of compunction.

(Psalms 60:5) 
You have given a sign to those who fear You, that they may flee from the face of the bow.

(Psalms 60:6) 
That Your beloved ones may be delivered; Save me with Your right hand, and hear me.

(Psalms 60:7)

(Psalms 60:8) 
Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head.

(Psalms 60:9) 
Moab is the pot of my hope; I will extend my shoe into Idumea, and the foreigners have become friends to me.

(Psalms 60:10) 
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will bring me into Idumea?

(Psalms 60:11) 
Will not You, O God, who have rejected us? And will You not go out, O God, in our powers?

(Psalms 60:12) 
Give us help from tribulation, for the safety of man is vain.

(Psalms 60:13) 
In God, we will do valiantly, and He will crush our enemies.

(Psalms 61:1) 
For the leader. For David. A Psalm.

(Psalms 61:2) 
God, hear my prayer; pay attention to my plea.

(Psalms 61:3) 
I called to you from the ends of the earth, when my heart was overwhelmed. You set me high on a rock.

(Psalms 61:4) 
For you have been my refuge. You have guided me and filled me with hope.

(Psalms 61:5) 
You are my protector. And I trust you.

(Psalms 61:6) 
Let me find joy in God again; and praise him again. All my being is in God.

(Psalms 61:7) 
Turn your face away from my sins and cleanse all my wrongdoing.

(Psalms 61:8) 
Create a clean heart in me, God, and renew a right spirit within me.

(Psalms 61:9) 
Do not cast me away from your face, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.

(Psalms 61:10) 
Give me back the joy of your salvation, and strengthen me with a willing spirit.

(Psalms 61:11) 
Then I will teach the wicked your ways, and sinners will return to you.

(Psalms 61:12) 
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your goodness.

(Psalms 61:13) 
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.

(Psalms 61:14) 
For you will not delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.

(Psalms 61:15) 
My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

(Psalms 61:16) 
Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

(Psalms 61:17) 
Then you will delight in right sacrifices, offerings and burnt offerings; then young bulls will be offered on your altar.

(Psalms 62:1) 
For the end. A Psalm of David.

(Psalms 62:2) 
O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn.

(Psalms 62:3) 
My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you!

(Psalms 62:4) 
In a desolate land, an empty desert without water: I came to you in the sanctuary, that I might see your power and glory.

(Psalms 62:5) 
Because your mercy is better than life; my lips shall praise you.

(Psalms 62:6) 
So will I bless you in my life: and in your name I will lift up my hands.

(Psalms 62:7) 
As with fat and richness is my soul filled: and with lips of joy my mouth shall praise you.

(Psalms 62:8) 
If I have remembered you upon my bed, in the morning I will meditate on you.

(Psalms 62:9) 
Because you have been my helper, and in the protection of your wings I will rejoice.

(Psalms 62:10) 
My soul has adhered to you: your right hand has taken me up.

(Psalms 62:11) 
But they have sought my soul in vain: they shall enter into the lower parts of the earth.

(Psalms 62:12) 
They shall be given into the hands of the sword: they shall be the portions of foxes.

(Psalms 62:13) 
But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone who swears by him shall be praised: because the mouth of those who speak wicked things has been stopped.

(Psalms 63:1) 
God, my God, I watch for you every morning.

(Psalms 63:2) 
My soul thirsts for you; I have such a deep desire for you!

(Psalms 63:3) 
In the land that's barren, and without a path, and without water.

(Psalms 63:4) 
I long to be with you in the holy temple, to behold your power and your glory.

(Psalms 63:5) 
Because your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise you.

(Psalms 63:6) 
So I will bless you for as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.

(Psalms 63:7) 
My soul is satisfied as with the richest foods, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.

(Psalms 63:8) 
When I remember you upon my bed, I meditate on you during the night.

(Psalms 63:9) 
Because you have been my help, and under the shadow of your wings I will sing.

(Psalms 63:10) 
My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.

(Psalms 63:11) 
But those who seek to destroy my soul will go down into the depths of the earth.

(Psalms 63:12) 
They shall be given over to the sword; they shall be the portion of the foxes.

(Psalms 63:13) 
But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who swears by him will be praised, because the mouths of those who speak wickedness are stopped.

(Psalms 64:1) 
For the leader: A psalm of David.

(Psalms 64:2) 
Praise is due to you, God, in Zion. Vows are paid to you in Jerusalem.

(Psalms 64:3) 
Hear my prayer. All men will come to you.

(Psalms 64:4) 
Our sins and weaknesses are too great for us, but by your grace, you forgive our sins.

(Psalms 64:5) 
How blessed are those whom you have chosen to be with you, and they will dwell with you in your courts.

(Psalms 64:6) 
We will be filled with blessings in your house. Your temple is holy, full of wonders and righteousness.

You established the mountains by your power, surrounded by strength.

(Psalms 64:9) 
You calm the deep waters with your voice.

(Psalms 64:12) 
You visit the earth, and make it fruitful. You greatly enrich it.

(Psalms 64:13) 
God's river is filled with water. You provide their food because you prepared the earth to be so.

(Psalms 64:14) 
You cause the streams to overflow. You make the earth flourish.

(Psalms 64:15) 
The ground is saturated with water. The new growth rejoices. You crown the year with your bounty.

(Psalms 64:16) 
The Lord blesses the earth. You crown the year with your bounty.

(Psalms 64:17) 
The pastures of the wilderness are filled with plenty and the hills are joyful.

(Psalms 64:18) 
The flocks of sheep cover the hills. The valleys are covered in grain. They all sing your praises.

(Psalms 65:1) 
For the leader. A song of David.

(Psalms 65:2) 
Praise is due to You, God, in Zion

(Psalms 65:3) 
and vows must be kept, offered up to You in Jerusalem.

Hear my prayer; all of mankind will come to you.

(Psalms 65:5) 
The evils of the wicked, including the sins of us all, overwhelm us

Hear us, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the seas far away,

(Psalms 65:10) 
who strengthens the mountains with your power, You are girded with strength.

(Psalms 65:11) 
You stir up the deep sea, the sound of its waves.

(Psalms 65:12) 
The nations will be terrified and those who dwell in the farthest reaches of the earth will be in awe of your signs. You will bring joy to the rising of the sun and the coming of the evening.

(Psalms 65:13) 
You have visited the earth and watered it; You have greatly enriched it.

(Psalms 65:14) 
God's river is filled with water. You prepared food for them, because this is how it should be prepared.

(Psalms 65:15) 
You fill its streams, and multiply its increase.

Let all the earth worship You, and sing to You; let them sing a psalm to Your name.

(Psalms 66:5) 
Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in his counsel toward all of mankind.

(Psalms 66:6) 
He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; we will rejoice in Him.

(Psalms 66:7) 
He reigns forever by His power; His eyes look upon the nations: let those who provoke Him not become proud.

(Psalms 66:8) 
Bless our God, O peoples, and make the sound of His praise heard,

(Psalms 66:9) 
who keeps my soul in life, and did not allow my feet to be moved.

(Psalms 66:10) 
For you have tried us, O God; You have tested us in fire, just as silver is tested.

(Psalms 66:11) 
You led us into the snare; You placed afflictions upon our backs.

(Psalms 66:12) 
You set men over our heads; we went through fire and water: and You brought us out into refreshment.

(Psalms 66:13) 
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows which my lips have uttered,

(Psalms 66:14) 
and which my lips promised in my tribulation.

(Psalms 66:15) 
I will offer You burnt offerings of fatlings with the incense of rams; I will offer You bulls with goats.

(Psalms 66:16) 
Come, hear, and I will tell, all you who fear God, how much He has done for my soul.

(Psalms 66:17) 
I cried out to Him with my mouth, and I exalted Him with my tongue.

(Psalms 66:18) 
If I had looked upon iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have heard me.

(Psalms 68:16)

Why do you suspect the congealed mountains? The mountain in which it pleased God to dwell: for the Lord will dwell to the end.

(Psalms 68:18) 
The chariots of God are manifold, of ten thousand, of thousands rejoicing: the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.

The Lord said: "I will bring back from Basan, I will bring back from the depths of the sea:

(Psalms 68:24) 
That your foot may be dipped in blood: the tongue of your dogs from the enemies.

(Psalms 68:25) 
Your footsteps have been seen, O God: the footsteps of my God, my King, Who is in the holy place.

(Psalms 68:33)

Ascribe glory to God: His magnificence is above Israel, and His power is in the clouds.

(Psalms 69:1) 
O God, come quickly to help me.

(Psalms 69:4) 
and may those who love your salvation say always, “God be praised”.

(Psalms 69:5) 
But I am poor and needy:

(Psalms 69:5) 
O God, come to my aid.

(Psalms 69:5) 
You are my helper and my savior;

(Psalms 69:5) 
Lord, do not delay.

(Psalms 70:1) 
In You, Lord, I have placed my hope. May I never be humiliated.

(Psalms 70:2) 
Free me with Your justice, and rescue me. Hear my prayer, and save me.

(Psalms 70:3) 
Be to me a God who protects, and a strong place where you can save me:

(Psalms 70:4) 
For You are my strength, and my refuge. And because of Your name, lead me to safety, and nourish me.

(Psalms 70:5) 
Bring me out of the trap they set for me. Because You are my protector.

(Psalms 70:6) 
Into Your hands I commend my spirit: You have redeemed me, Lord, God of truth.

(Psalms 70:7) 
You hate those who observe false idols. But I have placed my hope in the Lord.

(Psalms 70:8) 
I will rejoice and exult in Your mercy. Because You have seen my lowliness, and saved my soul from its troubles.

(Psalms 70:9) 
You have not handed me over to my enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place.

(Psalms 70:10) 
Have mercy on me, Lord, because I am in trouble. My eye is troubled in anger, my soul, and my belly.

(Psalms 70:11) 
For my life has failed in sorrow, and my years in groaning. My strength has become weak in poverty, and my bones have been disturbed.

(Psalms 70:12) 
I have become a reproach to all my enemies, and greatly to my neighbors. And a fear to my acquaintances.

(Psalms 70:13) 
Those who saw me, fled far away from me.

(Psalms 70:14) 
I am forgotten, as if I were dead from the heart. I have become like a broken vessel.

(Psalms 70:15) 
For I have heard the reproach of many who live around me. While they gather together against me, they plan to take my life.

(Psalms 70:16) 
But I have hoped in You, Lord. I said: “You are my God: In Your hands are my lots.”

(Psalms 70:17) 
Rescue me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

(Psalms 70:18) 
Shine Your face upon Your servant. Save me in Your mercy.

(Psalms 70:19) 
Lord, may I not be humiliated, because I have called upon You. May the wicked be humiliated, and led down to hell.

(Psalms 70:20) 
May deceitful mouths speak wickedness against the just man, in contempt and in persecuting him.

(Psalms 70:21) 
How great is the multitude of Your sweetness, Lord, which You have hidden for those who fear You. You have prepared it for those who hope in You, in the sight of the sons of men.

(Psalms 70:22) 
You will hide them in the secret of Your face, from the turmoil of men. You will protect them in Your tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.

(Psalms 70:23) 
Blessed is the Lord, because He has shown His mercy wonderfully to me in a city of defense.

(Psalms 70:24) 
But I said in the excess of my mind: “I am cast out from the face of Your eyes.” Therefore You have heard the voice of my prayer while I cried to You.

(Psalms 70:25) 
Love the Lord, all you His saints. Because the Lord will seek the truth, and will reward those who act with pride abundantly.

(Psalms 70:26) 
Act with courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all you who hope in the Lord.

(Psalms 71:1) 
In You, Lord, I put my trust, and I will never be put to shame: free me because you are just.

(Psalms 71:2) 
Turn your ear to me, and save me.

(Psalms 71:3) 
Be my God who protects me, and be a strong place for me, so that you might save me:

(Psalms 71:4) 
You are my strength, and you are my refuge. Guide me and sustain me because of your name.

(Psalms 71:5) 
Deliver me from the trap they set for me: because you are my protector.

(Psalms 71:6) 
I commit my spirit to your hands: you have redeemed me, Lord God of truth.

(Psalms 71:7) 
You hate those who watch over worthless idols, but I have put my trust in the Lord.

(Psalms 71:8) 
I will rejoice and exult in your mercy: because you have looked down on my humility, and you have saved my soul from its troubles.

(Psalms 71:9) 
You have not shut me into the hands of the enemy, but you have set my feet in a broad place.

(Psalms 71:10) 
Have mercy on me, Lord, because I am troubled: my eye, my soul, and my belly are troubled because of anger.

(Psalms 71:11) 
My life is failing because of the pain, and my years are spent in groaning. My strength is weakened by the poverty, and my bones are troubled.

(Psalms 71:12) 
I have become an object of scorn to all my enemies, and to my neighbors: and I am a terror to my acquaintances.

(Psalms 71:13) 
Those who saw me fled far away from me.

(Psalms 71:14) 
I am forgotten, like a dead man in their hearts: I am become like a broken vessel.

(Psalms 71:15) 
For I have heard the criticism of many who are gathered around me: they gathered together against me, and planned to take my life.

(Psalms 71:16) 
But I put my trust in you, Lord. I said, “You are my God, my destiny is in your hands.”

(Psalms 71:17) 
Deliver me from the hands of my enemies, and from those who are persecuting me.

(Psalms 71:18) 
Show your face to your servant: save me in your mercy.

(Psalms 71:19) 
Lord, I will not be put to shame, for I have called upon you: may the wicked be ashamed, and led down to hell.

(Psalms 71:20) 
Let the deceitful lips be silent: those who speak wickedness against the just.

(Psalms 71:21) 
How great is the abundance of your sweetness, Lord, which you have hidden for those who fear you: you have accomplished it for those who trust in you, in the sight of the sons of men.

(Psalms 71:22) 
You will hide them in the shelter of your face from the troubles of men: you will protect them in your tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.

(Psalms 71:23) 
Blessed be the Lord, for he has wonderfully shown his mercy to me in a fortified city.

(Psalms 71:24) 
But I said in my mental confusion: “I am cast out from before your eyes.” Therefore, you have heard the voice of my prayer when I cried out to you.

(Psalms 71:25) 
Love the Lord, all you his saints, because the Lord will seek out truth, and will give back abundantly to those who act with arrogance.

(Psalms 71:26) 
Be strong, and let your heart be strengthened, all you who hope in the Lord.

(Psalms 72:1) 
God, grant your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son.

(Psalms 72:2) 
May he judge your people justly, and the poor with righteousness.

(Psalms 72:3) 
May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills, justice.

(Psalms 72:4) 
May he judge the poor of the people, and save the children of the poor, and humiliate the oppressor.

(Psalms 72:5) 
May he endure as long as the sun and moon, from generation to generation.

(Psalms 72:6) 
May he come down like rain on the fleece, and like the drops falling on the earth.

(Psalms 72:7) 
In his days, justice will flourish, and an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.

(Psalms 72:8) 
May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

(Psalms 72:9) 
Before him, the Ethiopians will fall prostrate; and his enemies will lick the dust.

(Psalms 72:10) 
The kings of Tarshish and the islands will offer gifts; the kings of Arabia and Saba will bring offerings.

(Psalms 72:11) 
And all the kings of the earth will adore him; all nations will serve him.

(Psalms 72:12) 
For he will free the poor from the oppressor and the poor who have no helper.

(Psalms 72:13) 
He will spare the poor and the needy, and will save the souls of the poor.

(Psalms 72:14) 
From usury and injustice he will redeem their souls, and their name will be honorable before him.

(Psalms 72:15) 
And he will live, and he will be given gold from Arabia. They will adore him always; they will bless him all day long.

(Psalms 72:16) 
May there be a foundation in the land, on the tops of the mountains; may his fruit be exalted above Lebanon, and may they flourish from the city like the grass of the earth.

(Psalms 72:17) 
May his name be blessed forever. May his name endure before the sun.

(Psalms 72:18) 
And in him, all the tribes of the earth will be blessed. All nations will magnify him.

(Psalms 72:19) 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who alone does marvelous things.

(Psalms 72:20) 
And blessed be the name of his majesty forever. May his majesty fill the whole earth. Amen, so be it.

(Psalms 72:21) 
The work of David, the son of Jesse, is finished.

(Psalms 73:1) 
How good is the God of Israel to those who are pure of heart!

(Psalms 73:2) 
But my feet had almost stumbled. My steps were nearly unsteady.

(Psalms 73:3) 
Because I envied those who do evil, seeing the peace of sinners.

(Psalms 73:4) 
They have no regard for death, and they live free from all harm.

(Psalms 73:5) 
They have no struggles, and they aren’t struck down with others.

(Psalms 73:6) 
Therefore, pride grips them. They conceal their sin and their wickedness.

(Psalms 73:7) 
Their iniquity has burst forth, like a fat man. They pass into their own wicked desires.

(Psalms 73:8) 
They think of and speak of wickedness, they speak evil things from high places.

(Psalms 73:9) 
They set their mouths in the sky, and their tongues roam the earth.

(Psalms 73:10) 
Therefore, my people turn here, and full days will be found for them.

(Psalms 73:11) 
And they said, “How does God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?”

(Psalms 73:12) 
Behold, these are the sinners. They are rich in this world, and they have obtained riches.

(Psalms 73:13) 
And I said, “Then in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence.

(Psalms 73:14) 
I have been struck down all day long, and my chastisement comes every morning.”

(Psalms 73:15) 
If I had said, “I will speak like them,” then I would have rejected the generation of Your children.

(Psalms 73:16) 
And I considered how I could know this; it is a labor in my eyes,

(Psalms 73:17) 
until I enter the sanctuary of God, and then I will understand their end.

(Psalms 73:18) 
But truly You have set them in slippery places. You cast them down while they were lifted up.

(Psalms 73:19) 
How they have become desolate! Suddenly they have failed; they have perished through their own iniquity.

(Psalms 73:20) 
As a dream when one awakens, so, Lord, when You arise, You will despise their image.

(Psalms 73:21) 
Because my heart was inflamed, and my reins were changed;

(Psalms 73:22) 
and I was brought to nothing, and I did not know.

(Psalms 73:23) 
I was like a beast before You, but I am always with You.

(Psalms 73:24) 
I held Your hand, and in Your will You have led me, and You have received me in glory.

(Psalms 73:25) 
For what do I have in the universe? And what do I desire on the earth besides You?

(Psalms 73:26) 
My flesh and my heart failed; God is the God of my heart, and my portion is God forever.

(Psalms 73:27) 
For behold, those who distance themselves from You will perish; You have destroyed everyone who is unfaithful to You.

(Psalms 73:28) 
But for me, to cling to God is good; to put my hope in the Lord God,

(Psalms 73:29) 
that I may proclaim all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.

(Psalms 74:1) 
For the leader, in understanding. A psalm of David.

(Psalms 74:2) 
Why have you rejected us, God, forever? Is your anger ignited against the sheep of your pasture?

(Psalms 74:3) 
Remember your community, which you have held since the beginning.

(Psalms 74:4) 
Remember the tribe of your inheritance; the holy mountain of Zion, where you dwell.

(Psalms 74:5) 
Lift up your hands against the arrogant of the world. See how the enemy has made a mess of the holy place!

(Psalms 74:6) 
Your enemies brag in the place of your solemn festival.

(Psalms 74:7) 
They put their wickedness to an end; they did not understand.

(Psalms 74:8) 
They ruined your holy places.

(Psalms 74:9) 
They made it dark, and they cannot see what they do.

(Psalms 74:10) 
Indeed, God is our King forever; he has provided salvation here on Earth.

(Psalms 74:11) 
You, by your power, created the sea; you crushed the heads of the great sea monsters in the water.

(Psalms 74:12) 
You smashed the sea monster’s heads; you gave them as food to the Ethiopians.

(Psalms 74:13) 
You broke open the fountains and the torrents; you dried up the river Ethan.

(Psalms 74:14) 
The day is yours, and the night is yours; you created the dawn and the sun.

(Psalms 74:15) 
You made all the boundaries of the earth; you made the summer and the spring.

(Psalms 74:16) 
Remember this, Lord, the enemy has insulted you; and the foolish people have provoked your name.

(Psalms 74:17) 
Do not give the souls of those who praise you to wild beasts; do not forget the souls of your poor people forever.

(Psalms 74:18) 
Take note of your covenant, because those who have been cast down into the darkness of the land are filled with wickedness.

(Psalms 74:19) 
Do not let the humble be humiliated; the poor and needy will praise your name.

(Psalms 74:20) 
Rise up, God, and defend your cause; remember the insults you suffer, which the foolish hurl at you all day long.

(Psalms 74:21) 
Do not forget the voices of your enemies; the pride of those who hate you always rises up.

(Psalms 75:1) 
To the end. A song. A psalm of Asaph.

(Psalms 75:2) 
God is known in Judea, His name is great in Israel.

(Psalms 75:3) 
Peaceful is His dwelling, His home is in Zion.

(Psalms 75:4) 
There, He broke the strength of the bows: He shattered shields, swords, and war.

(Psalms 75:5) 
You are light, shining from the everlasting mountains.

(Psalms 75:6) 
All the foolish in heart were disturbed; they fell into their sleep.

(Psalms 75:7) 
All the rich men found nothing in their hands.

(Psalms 75:8) 
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, those who rode horses were made to sleep.

(Psalms 75:9) 
You are to be feared, and who can resist You? From then on, Your wrath reigns.

(Psalms 75:10) 
You made judgment heard from the sky: the land trembled and was still.

(Psalms 75:11) 
When God arose to judge, to save all the meek of the earth.

(Psalms 75:12) 
For the thought of man shall praise You, and the remnants of thought will keep festival for You.

(Psalms 75:13) 
Vow and give to the Lord your God; all who bring gifts around Him.

(Psalms 75:14) 
To Him who is to be feared, to Him who takes away the spirit of princes, to Him who is feared by the kings of the earth.

(Psalms 76:1) 
To the end, for the songs. A psalm of Asaph.

(Psalms 76:2) 
God is known in Judea, and His name is great in Israel.

(Psalms 76:3) 
He has chosen a place of peace, and His home is in Zion.

(Psalms 76:4) 
There, He broke the strength of bows and destroyed shields, swords, and war.

(Psalms 76:5) 
You are glorious and shine brighter than everything. The mountains are filled with prey.

(Psalms 76:6) 
The foolish are troubled in heart and will sleep the sleep of death.

(Psalms 76:7) 
All the wealthy will find nothing in their hands.

(Psalms 76:8) 
At your rebuke, God of Jacob, those who rode horses fell into a deep sleep.

(Psalms 76:9) 
You are terrible, and who can withstand You once your wrath is roused?

(Psalms 76:10) 
From the sky, You made Your judgment known. The earth trembled and was still,

(Psalms 76:11) 
when God rose up to judge, to save all the meek of the earth.

(Psalms 76:12) 
Truly, the thought of man will give thanks to You, and the remainder of thought will keep festival for You.

(Psalms 76:13) 
Make vows and give to the Lord your God, all you who bring gifts around Him.

(Psalms 76:14) 
To the terrible one, who takes away the spirit of princes, who is terrible to the kings of the earth.

(Psalms 77:1) 
Listen to me, my people, and pay attention to my law.

(Psalms 77:2) 
I will speak to you in a parable; I will tell you the mysteries of the past.

(Psalms 77:3) 
What we have heard and known, our fathers have told us.

(Psalms 77:4) 
We will not hide it from our children, from their generation to the next.

(Psalms 77:5) 
We will tell of the Lord's praises and virtues, and His wondrous works.

(Psalms 77:6) 
He established a covenant with Jacob, and the law was made for Israel.

(Psalms 77:7) 
He commanded our fathers to teach them to their children, so that the next generation might know.

(Psalms 77:8) 
The children who would be born and grow up, so they can tell their children.

(Psalms 77:9) 
They must put their hope in God, never forgetting the works of God, and keeping His commandments.

(Psalms 77:10) 
They will not become like their fathers, a perverse and rebellious generation.

(Psalms 77:11) 
A generation that did not keep their hearts right with God, and their spirit did not believe in Him.

(Psalms 77:12) 
The sons of Ephraim, skilled with the bow, turned back in the day of battle.

(Psalms 77:13) 
They did not keep the covenant of God, and they refused to walk in His law.

(Psalms 77:14) 
They forgot His benefits, and the wonders He showed them.

(Psalms 77:15) 
He performed miracles before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Zoan.

(Psalms 77:16) 
He split the sea and led them through, and made the waters stand like a wall.

(Psalms 77:17) 
He led them with a cloud by day and with the light of fire all night.

(Psalms 77:18) 
He split the rocks in the desert and gave them drink as from a great depth.

(Psalms 77:19) 
He brought water out of the rock and made the waters run down like rivers.

(Psalms 77:20) 
Yet they continued to sin against Him, provoking the Most High in the desert.

(Psalms 77:21) 
They tested God in their hearts by asking for food to satisfy their craving.

(Psalms 77:22) 
They spoke against God, and said: "Can God prepare a table in the desert?"

(Psalms 77:23) 
Behold, He struck the rock, and waters flowed out, and streams overflowed. Can He also give bread, or prepare a table for His people?

(Psalms 77:24) 
Therefore the Lord heard them and was angry, and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger went up against Israel.

(Psalms 77:25) 
Because they did not believe in God, nor did they trust in His salvation.

(Psalms 77:26) 
He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.

(Psalms 77:27) 
He rained down manna for them to eat and gave them the bread of heaven.

(Psalms 77:28) 
Man ate the bread of the angels; He sent them food in abundance.

(Psalms 77:29) 
He brought the south wind from the heavens and by His power brought in the south wind.

(Psalms 77:30) 
He rained meat on them like dust and winged birds like the sand of the sea.

(Psalms 77:31) 
He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their dwellings.

(Psalms 77:32) 
So they ate and were well filled, and He gave them what they craved.

(Psalms 77:33) 
They were not disappointed in their desire; while their food was still in their mouths.

(Psalms 77:34) 
The anger of God arose against them, and He killed the fattest of them and struck down the chosen men of Israel.

(Psalms 77:35) 
In all these things they still sinned and did not believe in His wonders.

(Psalms 77:36) 
So their days were spent in futility, and their years in haste.

(Psalms 77:37) 
When He killed them, they sought Him, and returned and sought God.

(Psalms 77:38) 
They remembered that God was their rock and that the Most High God was their Redeemer.

(Psalms 77:39) 
But they flattered Him with their mouths, and their tongues lied to Him.

(Psalms 77:40) 
For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, nor were they faithful to His covenant.

(Psalms 77:41) 
But He, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.

(Psalms 77:42) 
He often restrained His anger and did not stir up all His wrath.

(Psalms 77:43) 
He remembered that they were flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.

(Psalms 77:44) 
How often they provoked Him in the desert, and grieved Him in the wasteland?

(Psalms 77:45) 
They turned back and tested God, and vexed the Holy One of Israel.

(Psalms 77:46) 
They did not remember His hand or the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

(Psalms 77:47) 
How He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the plain of Zoan.

(Psalms 77:48) 
He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink their streams.

(Psalms 77:49) 
He sent among them swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.

(Psalms 77:50) 
He gave their crops to the caterpillar and their labor to the locust.

(Psalms 77:51) 
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.

(Psalms 77:52) 
He gave over their livestock to the hail and their possessions to the fire.

(Psalms 77:53) 
He sent against them the heat of His anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels.

(Psalms 77:54) 
He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.

(Psalms 77:55) 
He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.

(Psalms 77:56) 
Then He led forth His people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

(Psalms 77:57) 
He led them safely, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

(Psalms 77:58) 
He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain which His right hand had won.

(Psalms 77:59) 
He drove out the nations before them; He divided the land to them as an inheritance by lot.

(Psalms 77:60) 
He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.

(Psalms 77:61) 
Then the Lord awoke as one from sleep, like a warrior refreshed with wine.

(Psalms 77:62) 
He struck His enemies in the back; He put them to everlasting shame.

(Psalms 77:63) 
He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

(Psalms 77:64) 
But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.

(Psalms 77:65) 
He built His sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth that He has established forever.

(Psalms 77:66) 
He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds.

(Psalms 77:67) 
From following the ewes with young, He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance.

(Psalms 77:68) 
So he shepherded them with a blameless heart and guided them by his skillful hand.

(Psalms 78:1) 
Pay attention, my people, and listen to my law. Open your ears to the words I speak.

(Psalms 78:2) 
I will use parables when I speak; I will speak old stories.

(Psalms 78:3) 
I will tell you all that we have heard, and have learned from our fathers.

(Psalms 78:4) 
We won’t hide these truths from our children, but we will tell them to the next generation.

(Psalms 78:5) 
We will tell how the Lord is worthy of praise, of His mighty deeds and the miracles that He did.

(Psalms 78:6) 
He established a covenant with Jacob and gave His law to Israel. He commanded our ancestors to teach these things to their children,

(Psalms 78:7) 
so that the next generation would know them— the children yet to be born. They would tell their own children.

(Psalms 78:8) 
Then they would put their hope in God, never forget the works of God, and always keep His commandments.

(Psalms 78:9) 
They would not be like their ancestors, a rebellious and stubborn generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.

(Psalms 78:10) 
The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows and arrows, turned their backs in battle.

(Psalms 78:11) 
They did not keep God’s covenant, and they refused to obey His law.

(Psalms 78:12) 
They forgot His deeds and the miracles that He had shown them.

(Psalms 78:13) 
He performed miracles in front of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Zoan.

(Psalms 78:14) 
He divided the sea and led them through, and He made the waters stand like walls.

(Psalms 78:15) 
He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of fire all night.

(Psalms 78:16) 
He split rocks in the desert and gave them water as from the depths of the sea.

(Psalms 78:17) 
He caused water to flow from the rock, and made waters run down like rivers.

(Psalms 78:18) 
But they continued to sin against Him; they provoked the Most High in the desert.

(Psalms 78:19) 
They tested God in their hearts, asking for food to satisfy their desires.

(Psalms 78:20) 
They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the desert?

(Psalms 78:21) 
When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams overflowed, but can He also give us bread, or supply meat for His people?”

(Psalms 78:22) 
When the Lord heard them, He was angry. Fire blazed up against Jacob, and wrath rose against Israel,

(Psalms 78:23) 
because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation.

(Psalms 78:24) 
Yet He commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of the sky.

(Psalms 78:25) 
He rained down manna for them to eat, giving them the bread of the heavens.

(Psalms 78:26) 
Humans ate the food of angels; He sent them food in abundance.

(Psalms 78:27) 
He sent an east wind from the sky, and by His power brought in the south wind.

(Psalms 78:28) 
He rained down meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.

(Psalms 78:29) 
He made the birds fall in the middle of their camp, all around their tents.

(Psalms 78:30) 
They ate and were fully satisfied; He gave them what they craved.

(Psalms 78:31) 
But before they could stop eating, and before their cravings were satisfied,

(Psalms 78:32) 
God’s anger rose against them. He killed the strongest among them, and struck down the finest men of Israel.

(Psalms 78:33) 
In spite of all this, they kept sinning; they did not believe in His wonders.

(Psalms 78:34) 
So He brought their days to an end like a breath, and their years in terror.

(Psalms 78:35) 
When He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and earnestly sought God.

(Psalms 78:36) 
Then they remembered that God was their rock, that God Most High was their redeemer.

(Psalms 78:37) 
But they only flattered Him with their mouths; they lied to Him with their tongues.

(Psalms 78:38) 
Their hearts were not sincere toward Him; they were not faithful to His covenant.

(Psalms 78:39) 
But He, being compassionate, forgave their sin and did not destroy them; He often held back His anger, and did not stir up all His wrath.

(Psalms 78:40) 
He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.

(Psalms 78:41) 
How often they defied Him in the desert, how often they grieved Him in the wilderness!

(Psalms 78:42) 
Again and again they tested God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.

(Psalms 78:43) 
They did not remember His power, nor the day when He redeemed them from the oppressor.

(Psalms 78:44) 
He displayed His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the plain of Zoan.

(Psalms 78:45) 
He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink from their streams.

(Psalms 78:46) 
He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.

(Psalms 78:47) 
He gave their crops to the locusts, and the fruit of their labor to the grasshoppers.

(Psalms 78:48) 
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with frost.

(Psalms 78:49) 
He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to the lightning.

(Psalms 78:50) 
He unleashed against them the heat of His anger, His wrath, indignation, and trouble—a band of destroying angels.

(Psalms 78:51) 
He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their lives from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.

(Psalms 78:52) 
He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.

(Psalms 78:53) 
But He led out His people like a flock; He guided them like a flock through the desert.

(Psalms 78:54) 
He led them safely, and they were not afraid, while the sea engulfed their enemies.

(Psalms 78:55) 
He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had won.

(Psalms 78:56) 
He drove out the nations before them, and apportioned their land as an inheritance by lot.

(Psalms 78:57) 
He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.

(Psalms 78:58) 
But they tested and defied God Most High, and did not keep His decrees.

(Psalms 78:59) 
Like their ancestors, they turned back and were faithless; they were like a treacherous bow.

(Psalms 78:60) 
The men of Ephraim, armed with bows, turned back in the day of battle.

(Psalms 78:61) 
They did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.

(Psalms 78:62) 
They forgot His deeds and the wonders He had shown them.

(Psalms 78:63) 
He performed miracles in Egypt, His wonders in the plain of Zoan.

(Psalms 78:64) 
He turned their rivers to blood, and they could not drink from their streams.

(Psalms 78:65) 
He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.

(Psalms 78:66) 
He gave their crops to the locusts, and the fruit of their labor to the grasshoppers.

(Psalms 78:67) 
He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-fig trees with frost.

(Psalms 78:68) 
He gave their cattle over to the hail, and their flocks to the lightning.

(Psalms 78:69) 
He unleashed against them the heat of His anger, His wrath, indignation, and trouble—a band of destroying angels.

(Psalms 78:70) 
He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their lives from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.

(Psalms 78:71) 
He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.

(Psalms 78:72) 
But He led out His people like a flock; He guided them like a flock through the desert.

(Psalms 78:73) 
He led them safely, and they were not afraid, while the sea engulfed their enemies.

(Psalms 78:74) 
He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had won.

(Psalms 78:75) 
He drove out the nations before them, and apportioned their land as an inheritance by lot.

(Psalms 78:76) 
He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.

(Psalms 78:77) 
Then He turned away and abandoned them, and did not give them any more help.

(Psalms 78:78) 
So He was angry with Israel, and utterly rejected them.

(Psalms 78:79) 
He abandoned the tabernacle in Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.

(Psalms 78:80) 
He allowed His strength to be captured, and His glory to be in the hands of the enemy.

(Psalms 78:81) 
He gave His people over to the sword, and was not concerned about His inheritance.

(Psalms 78:82) 
Fire devoured their young men, and their young women were not praised.

(Psalms 78:83) 
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows were not lamented.

(Psalms 78:84) 
Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior refreshed by wine.

(Psalms 78:85) 
He struck his enemies in the rear, and put them to everlasting shame.

(Psalms 78:86) 
He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;

(Psalms 78:87) 
but He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.

(Psalms 78:88) 
He built His sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which He established forever.

(Psalms 78:89) 
He chose David His servant, and took him from the sheep pens.

(Psalms 78:90) 
From tending the ewes with their young, He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people, Israel His inheritance.

(Psalms 78:91) 
He shepherded them with a pure heart, and guided them with skillful hands.

(Psalms 79:1) 
A Psalm by Asaph. O God, gentiles have entered into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple and have made Jerusalem into a pile of rubble.

(Psalms 79:2) 
They left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds in the sky. They left the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the land.

(Psalms 79:3) 
They have shed their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them.

(Psalms 79:4) 
We have become the mockery of our neighbors, a laughingstock and a joke to those around us.

(Psalms 79:5) 
How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like a fire?

(Psalms 79:6) 
Pour out your wrath on the gentiles who do not know you, and on the kingdoms that have not called on your name.

(Psalms 79:7) 
For they have consumed Jacob, and they have laid waste his place.

(Psalms 79:8) 
Do not remember our former iniquities. Let your mercies quickly come to meet us, for we have become very poor.

(Psalms 79:9) 
Help us, O God of our salvation, and for the glory of your name, deliver us. Be gracious to our sins for your name's sake.

(Psalms 79:10) 
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the vengeance for the blood of your servants, which has been poured out, be made known among the nations before our eyes.

(Psalms 79:11) 
Let the groaning of the prisoners come before you. According to the greatness of your arm, preserve the sons of death.

(Psalms 79:12) 
And repay our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom the reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.

(Psalms 79:13) 
But we, your people, and the sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will announce your praise from generation to generation.

(Psalms 80:1) 
For the leader; for the presses. A Psalm. Of Asaph.

(Psalms 80:2) 
O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, You who lead Joseph like a sheep.

(Psalms 80:3) 
You who sit above the cherubim, be revealed.

(Psalms 80:4) 
Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up Your power, and come to save us.

(Psalms 80:5) 
Turn us back, O God, and show us Your face, and we shall be saved.

(Psalms 80:6) 
O Lord God of hosts, how long will You be angry with Your servant's prayer?

(Psalms 80:7) 
You have fed us with the bread of tears, and given us tears to drink in full measure.

(Psalms 80:8) 
You have made us a source of conflict for our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.

(Psalms 80:9) 
Turn us back, O God of hosts, and show us Your face, and we shall be saved.

(Psalms 80:10) 
You brought a vine out of Egypt; You cast out the nations and planted it.

(Psalms 80:11) 
You were the guide of its journey; You planted its roots, and it filled the earth.

(Psalms 80:12) 
Its shadow covered the mountains, and its branches the cedars of God.

(Psalms 80:13) 
It sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river.

(Psalms 80:14) 
Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by the way pluck it?

(Psalms 80:15) 
The boar from the forest ravages it, and the wild beast devours it.

(Psalms 80:16) 
Turn, God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine.

(Psalms 80:17) 
Protect that which Your right hand has planted, and the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself.

(Psalms 80:18) 
It is burned with fire, and cut down at the rebuke of Your countenance.

(Psalms 80:19) 
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, and upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself.

(Psalms 80:20) 
Then we will not turn back from You; You will revive us, and we will call upon Your name.

(Psalms 80:21) 
O Lord God of hosts, turn us back; show Your face, and we shall be saved.

(Psalms 81:1) 
For the leader. A song. For the wine presses, the sons of Korah.

(Psalms 81:2) 
How beloved are your tabernacles, Lord of hosts!

(Psalms 81:3) 
My soul longs, and faints, for the courts of the Lord.

(Psalms 81:4) 
My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.

(Psalms 81:5) 
For even the sparrow has found a house for itself, and the turtledove a nest for itself, where it may lay its young.

(Psalms 81:6) 
Your altars, Lord of hosts, my King and my God!

(Psalms 81:7) 
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord: they shall praise you for ever and ever.

(Psalms 81:8) 
Blessed is the man whose help comes from you: He has arranged ascensions in his heart.

(Psalms 81:9) 
Passing through the valley of tears, in the place that he has appointed.

(Psalms 81:10) 
For the lawgiver will give a blessing: they shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods will be seen in Sion.

(Psalms 81:11) 
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.

(Psalms 81:12) 
Behold our protector, O God: and look upon the face of your Christ.

(Psalms 81:13) 
For one day in your courts is better than a thousand.

(Psalms 81:14) 
I have chosen to be a castaway in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.

(Psalms 81:15) 
For God loves mercy and truth: the Lord will give grace and glory.

(Psalms 81:16) 
He will not deprive of goods those who walk in their innocence.

(Psalms 81:17) 
O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man who hopes in you.

(Psalms 82:1) 
God has taken His place among the assembly of all the gods, and He judges them all, fairly.

(Psalms 82:2) 
“How much longer will you judge unfairly? How much longer will you favor the wicked?

(Psalms 82:3) 
Judge the needy, the orphan, the humble, and the poor.

(Psalms 82:4) 
Rescue the poor and the weak from the hand of the wicked.

(Psalms 82:5) 
They don't know anything, and they don't understand. They wander in darkness, and they don't know. All the foundations of the earth are shaking.

(Psalms 82:6) 
I said, 'You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.'

(Psalms 82:7) 
But you will die as mere men do. You'll fall as any prince would.

(Psalms 82:8) 
Arise, God, and judge the earth, for You will inherit all the nations.

(Psalms 83:1) 
The song of Psalm 83 by Asaph.

(Psalms 83:2) 
O God, who is like You? Don't be silent, don't hold back, O God.

(Psalms 83:3) 
Your enemies are rising up, and those who hate You are growing in power.

(Psalms 83:4) 
They conspire against Your people. They plot against those dedicated to You.

(Psalms 83:5) 
They say, “Come, let's destroy them. Let's wipe out their nation so that Israel is forgotten forever.”

(Psalms 83:6) 
They all agree and make an alliance against You,

(Psalms 83:7) 
The tents of Edom, the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes;

(Psalms 83:8) 
Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistia, and the inhabitants of Tyre.

(Psalms 83:9) 
Assyria has also joined them, supporting the descendants of Lot.

(Psalms 83:10) 
Do to them what You did to Midian and Sisera, what You did to Jabin at the Kishon River.

(Psalms 83:11) 
They were defeated at Endor, and they rotted away, polluting the land.

(Psalms 83:12) 
Treat their leaders as You treated Oreb, Zeb, Zeba, and Zalmunna, all of their leaders.

(Psalms 83:13) 
They said, “Let’s take possession of God's territory!”

(Psalms 83:14) 
O my God, make them like a rolling wheel, like chaff before the wind.

(Psalms 83:15) 
As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets mountains ablaze,

(Psalms 83:16) 
So shall You pursue them with Your storm. In Your wrath, terrify them!

(Psalms 83:17) 
Fill their faces with shame. Then they will seek Your name, O Lord.

(Psalms 83:18) 
May they be ashamed and terrified forever. May they be disgraced and destroyed.

(Psalms 83:19) 
Then they will know that You alone are the Lord. You alone are the Most High over all the earth.

(Psalms 84:1) 
For the leader; a psalm for the sons of Korah.

(Psalms 84:2) 
How glorious are your dwelling places, Lord of hosts!

(Psalms 84:3) 
My soul longs to go where you are. My heart aches for the courts of the Lord.

(Psalms 84:4) 
My heart and flesh now cry out with joy to the living God.

(Psalms 84:5) 
Even the sparrow has found a home for herself, and the turtledove has found a nest for her young.

(Psalms 84:6) 
These are your altars, Lord of hosts, my King and my God.

(Psalms 84:7) 
Happy are those who dwell in your house, O Lord; they will be praising you through all eternity.

(Psalms 84:8) 
Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; he has prepared his ascent in his heart, in the valley of tears, in the place that God has set.

(Psalms 84:9) 
For the law-giver will give blessings, and the faithful will grow in strength: you will see the God of gods in Zion.

(Psalms 84:10) 
Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob.

(Psalms 84:11) 
O God, our protector, look upon us; and look upon the face of your Christ.

(Psalms 84:12) 
One day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere: I have chosen to be cast out in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.

(Psalms 84:13) 
For God loves mercy and truth; he will give grace and glory.

(Psalms 84:14) 
He will not withhold good things from those who walk in innocence: O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in you.

(Psalms 85:1) 
O Lord, You have shown favor and brought blessings to Your land; You have brought back the captives of Jacob:

(Psalms 85:2) 
You have forgiven the sins of Your people; You have covered over all their transgressions.

(Psalms 85:3) 
You have calmed all Your wrath; You have turned away from the heat of Your anger.

(Psalms 85:4) 
Turn to us again, O God of our salvation, and turn away Your anger from us.

(Psalms 85:5) 
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You extend Your anger from one generation to another?

(Psalms 85:6) 
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?

(Psalms 85:7) 
Show us Your mercy, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation.

(Psalms 85:8) 
I will listen to what God the Lord says, for He will speak peace to His people, and to His saints, and to those who turn their hearts to Him.

(Psalms 85:9) 
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.

(Psalms 85:10) 
Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

(Psalms 85:11) 
Truth springs up from the earth, and righteousness looks down from the sky.

(Psalms 85:12) 
Indeed, the Lord will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase.

(Psalms 85:13) 
Righteousness will go before Him, and will make His footsteps into a path.

(Psalms 86:1) 
A prayer of David. Lord, please listen to me and answer my prayer because I am lowly and poor.

(Psalms 86:2) 
Keep my soul safe, because I am devoted to you; save your servant, O my God, who trusts in you.

(Psalms 86:3) 
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I call to you all day long.

(Psalms 86:4) 
Bring joy to the soul of your servant, because, O Lord, I lift up my soul to you.

(Psalms 86:5) 
For you, Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in mercy to all who call upon you.

(Psalms 86:6) 
Lord, hear my prayer and listen to my plea.

(Psalms 86:7) 
In the day of my distress, I called to you because you heard me.

(Psalms 86:8) 
Among the gods, there is no one like you, Lord, nor are there any works like your works.

(Psalms 86:9) 
All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord, and will glorify your name.

(Psalms 86:10) 
For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.

(Psalms 86:11) 
Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart that I may fear your name.

(Psalms 86:12) 
I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name forever.

(Psalms 86:13) 
For your mercy to me is great, and you have rescued my soul from the depths of hell.

(Psalms 86:14) 
O God, the arrogant have risen against me, and a band of ruthless men seeks my life, not setting you before their eyes.

(Psalms 86:15) 
But you, Lord God, are compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in mercy and faithfulness.

(Psalms 86:16) 
Turn to me and have mercy on me; give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maidservant.

(Psalms 86:17) 
Show me a sign of your favor, so that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

(Psalms 87:1) 
The foundations of Jerusalem are on the holy mountains.

(Psalms 87:2) 
The Lord loves the gates of Jerusalem more than all the dwelling places of Israel.

(Psalms 87:3) 
Glorious things are said about you, city of God.

(Psalms 87:4) 
I will remember Rahab and Babylon, who know me.

(Psalms 87:5) 
Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and the people of Ethiopia; these were there.

(Psalms 87:6) 
And it shall be said of Zion: “Every man was born there; and the Most High has founded her.”

(Psalms 87:7) 
The Lord shall record in the book of the peoples and of the princes, of those who were in her.

(Psalms 87:8) 
The dwelling places of all rejoice in you.

(Psalms 88:1) 
O Lord, God of my salvation: by day I have cried out, and in the night before you.

(Psalms 88:2) 
Let my prayer enter into your presence: incline your ear to my prayer.

(Psalms 88:3) 
For my soul is filled with evils: and my life has approached to the abyss.

(Psalms 88:4) 
I am counted among those who go down into the pit: I have become like a man without help,

(Psalms 88:5) 
free among the dead: like the wounded sleeping in the sepulchres, of whom you are no longer mindful: and they have been cast off from your hand.

(Psalms 88:6) 
They have laid me in the lowest pit: in darkness, and in the shadow of death.

(Psalms 88:7) 
Your wrath has been confirmed over me: and you have brought all your waves over me.

(Psalms 88:8) 
You have distanced my acquaintances from me: they have made me an abomination to themselves.

(Psalms 88:9) 
I have been delivered, and I could not go out: my eyes languished for want.

(Psalms 88:10) 
I have cried to you, O Lord, all day: I have extended my hands to you.

(Psalms 88:11) 
Will you work wonders for the dead? or will the doctors raise them up, and confess to you?

(Psalms 88:12) 
Will anyone declare your mercy in the sepulchre, and your truth in perdition?

(Psalms 88:13) 
Will your wonders be known in the dark, and your justice in the land of oblivion?

(Psalms 88:14) 
And I, O Lord, have cried to you: and in the morning my prayer will come before you.

(Psalms 88:15) 
Why, O Lord, do you cast off my soul: you turn your face away from me?

(Psalms 88:16) 
I am poor, and in labors from my youth: but being exalted, I was humbled and disturbed.

(Psalms 88:17) 
Your wrath has passed over me: and your terrors have troubled me.

(Psalms 88:18) 
They have surrounded me like water all day: they have surrounded me together.

(Psalms 88:19) 
You have removed from me friend and neighbor: and my acquaintances because of misery.

(Psalms 89:1) 
O Lord, you've been my only love from all of eternity; and I will not be parted from you.

(Psalms 89:2) 
My flesh is now decaying, and my heart is failing: but God is the strength of my heart, and God will be my portion for all eternity.

(Psalms 89:3) 
For see, those who try to separate themselves from you will be lost: you will destroy everyone who abandons you.

(Psalms 89:4) 
But for me, it's a good thing to cling to God; I place my hope in the Lord God, so I can tell all the things you've done in the gates of the daughter of Zion.

(Psalms 89:5) 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

(Psalms 89:6) 
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

(Psalms 89:7) 
Lord, you've blessed the earth; You have turned again the captivity of Jacob.

(Psalms 89:8) 
You've forgiven the iniquity of your people; you've covered all their sins.

(Psalms 89:9) 
You have calmed all your anger; you have turned away from your wrath.

(Psalms 89:10) 
Turn to us, O God our savior; and turn away your anger from us.

(Psalms 89:11) 
Will you be angry with us forever? Will you stretch out your anger from one generation to another?

(Psalms 89:12) 
God, if you turn back to us, you will give us life; and your people will rejoice in you.

(Psalms 89:13) 
Show us your mercy, O Lord; and grant us your salvation.

(Psalms 89:14) 
I will listen to what the Lord God speaks; for he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those who turn their heart to him.

(Psalms 89:15)

Surely the Lord will give us what is good; and our land will yield its fruit.

(Psalms 89:19) 
Justice will walk before him; and he will set his footsteps in the way.

(Psalms 90:1) 
Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to the next.

(Psalms 90:2) 
Even before the mountains were made, before the earth and all the universe were formed, you have always existed, and you will always exist.

(Psalms 90:3) 
You turn men back to dust and say: “Return, sons of men!”

(Psalms 90:4) 
Because a thousand years in your sight are like the passing of yesterday, like a fleeting moment in the night.

(Psalms 90:5) 
You sweep people away in death; their lives are a mere moment. They’re like grass that quickly withers,

(Psalms 90:6) 
that flourishes in the morning, but by evening it is cut down, withered, and dried up.

(Psalms 90:7) 
We are consumed by your anger; we are terrified by your wrath.

(Psalms 90:8) 
You have placed our sins before you, our secret sins under the light of your presence.

(Psalms 90:9) 
All of our days pass under your wrath; we are consumed in a moment.

(Psalms 90:10) 
The years of our lives pass like a spider’s web. The span of our lives is seventy years,

(Psalms 90:11) 
or perhaps, if we are strong, eighty years; even then, their lives are spent mostly in toil and sorrow.

(Psalms 90:12) 
They quickly pass away; we fade.

(Psalms 90:13) 
Who knows the power of your anger? Who understands the full extent of your wrath?

(Psalms 90:14) 
Teach us to number our days so that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

(Psalms 90:15) 
Return, O Lord! How long will you delay? Have pity on your servants.

(Psalms 90:16) 
Satisfy us each morning with your love so that we may be filled with joy for all our days.

(Psalms 90:17) 
Make us rejoice for as long as you have afflicted us, for the years when we saw suffering.

(Psalms 90:18) 
Show your servants your work, and show your glory to their children.

(Psalms 90:19) 
May the Lord, our God, show us his favor. Make all that we do succeed. Yes, make it all succeed.

(Psalms 91:1) 
If you dwell and rest in the help of the Highest God, then you will also dwell in the protection of the sky.

(Psalms 91:2) 
You will say to God the Father: "You are my protector and my refuge: my God, in You I will hope."

(Psalms 91:3) 
Because He freed me from the snare of the hunters and from a harsh word.

(Psalms 91:4) 
With His wings He will overshadow you and protect you, and under His protection you will hope:

(Psalms 91:5) 
His truth and love is a shield and a protection.

(Psalms 91:6) 
You will not fear the fear of the darkness of night, nor will you be frightened by the arrow of sin that flies in the day,

(Psalms 91:7) 
nor of the plague that travels in darkness, nor of the destruction and the devil of the midday sun.

(Psalms 91:8) 
Though a thousand men may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand:

(Psalms 91:9) 
it will not come near you.

(Psalms 91:10) 
But your eyes will see what the true nature of things are, and you will see the punishment of sinners.

(Psalms 91:11) 
Because you are, O Lord, my hope:

(Psalms 91:12) 
You have made God the Highest, your refuge.

(Psalms 91:13) 
Evil shall not come to you, and the scourge of sin will not come near your dwelling.

(Psalms 91:14) 
For He has given His angels the command to guard you in all your ways.

(Psalms 91:15) 
They will carry you in their hands, so you will not strike your foot against a stone.

(Psalms 91:16) 
You will walk over the asp and the basilisk: and you will trample on the lion and the dragon.

(Psalms 91:17) 
“Because he has hoped in Me, I will free him, and I will protect him, because he knows My Name.

(Psalms 91:18) 
When he calls to Me, I will hear him: I am with him in tribulation: I will rescue him, and I will glorify him.

(Psalms 91:19) 
I will fill him with length of days, and I will show him My salvation.

(Psalms 92:1) 
This is a Psalm for singing on the Sabbath.

(Psalms 92:2) 
It is right to give praise to God; and to sing hymns to your name, Most High God;

(Psalms 92:3) 
Proclaiming Your mercy in the morning, and Your truth through the night:

(Psalms 92:4) 
With a ten-stringed instrument, with a hymn on the harp.

(Psalms 92:5) 
For You have made me glad, O Lord, by Your works: and in the works of Your hands I will rejoice.

(Psalms 92:6) 
How great are Your works, O Lord! Your thoughts are exceedingly deep.

(Psalms 92:7) 
The foolish man does not know this, and the stupid man does not understand.

Planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

(Psalms 92:15) 
They will still multiply in old age: and will be prosperous, that they may announce.

(Psalms 92:16) 
For the Lord our God is just: and there is no iniquity in Him.

(Psalms 94:3) 
Lord, how much longer will the wicked sin? How much longer will the wicked be honored?

(Psalms 94:4) 
They are always saying evil things, and they are always saying them.

(Psalms 94:5) 
Lord, they are crushing your people, and they are tormenting your inheritance.

(Psalms 94:6) 
They murder widows and foreigners, and they kill orphans.

(Psalms 94:7) 
They say, “The Lord will not see it, and the God of Jacob will not understand.”

Understand this, foolish people. You fools, wake up!

(Psalms 94:9) 
God made our ears, and He will hear us. God made our eyes, and He will see us.

Happy is the man whom the Lord corrects; He will teach him out of His law.

(Psalms 94:13) 
God will give him rest from the evil days until the pit is dug for the wicked man.

(Psalms 103:19) 
The Lord has prepared His throne in the sky, and His kingdom rules over all.

(Psalms 103:20) 
Bless the Lord, all you His angels, mighty in power, doing His word, to heed the voice of His words.

(Psalms 103:21) 
Bless the Lord, all you His powers; His ministers, who do His will.

(Psalms 103:22) 
Bless the Lord, all you His works, in every place of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.

(Psalms 104:1) 
Praise God, my soul!

(Psalms 104:2) 
You are truly magnificent, my Lord God.

(Psalms 104:3) 
You have robed yourself with majesty and beauty.

(Psalms 104:4) 
You are clothed in light as if with a garment.

(Psalms 104:5) 
You spread out the sky like a tent.

(Psalms 104:6) 
You build your home above the sky; your high dwelling is in the heavens.

(Psalms 104:7) 
You make the clouds your chariot,

(Psalms 104:8) 
You travel on the wings of the wind.

(Psalms 104:9) 
You make the winds your messengers,

(Psalms 104:10) 
and flaming fire your servants.

(Psalms 104:11) 
You set the earth on its foundations

(Psalms 104:12) 
so that it shall never be moved.

(Psalms 104:13) 
You covered it with the deep as with a garment;

(Psalms 104:14) 
the waters stood above the mountains.

(Psalms 104:15) 
At your rebuke they fled,

(Psalms 104:16) 
at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.

(Psalms 104:17) 
They rose up to the mountains, they went down into the valleys

(Psalms 104:18) 
to the place which you established for them.

(Psalms 104:19) 
You set a boundary which they shall not pass,

(Psalms 104:20) 
neither shall they return to cover the earth.

(Psalms 104:21) 
You cause springs to gush forth in the valleys;

(Psalms 104:22) 
they flow between the mountains.

(Psalms 104:23) 
They give drink to every beast of the field;

(Psalms 104:24) 
the wild asses quench their thirst.

(Psalms 104:25) 
Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;

(Psalms 104:26) 
they sing among the branches.

(Psalms 104:27) 
From your lofty abode you water the mountains;

(Psalms 104:28) 
the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.

(Psalms 104:29) 
You cause the grass to grow for the cattle,

(Psalms 104:30) 
and plants for the service of man,

(Psalms 104:31) 
that you may bring forth food from the earth,

(Psalms 104:32) 
and wine to gladden the heart of man,

(Psalms 104:33) 
to make his face shine with oil,

(Psalms 104:34) 
and bread to strengthen man's heart.

(Psalms 104:35) 
The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon, which he planted.

(Psalms 104:36) 
There the birds build their nests;

(Psalms 104:37) 
the stork has its home there.

(Psalms 104:38) 
The high mountains are for the wild goats;

(Psalms 104:39) 
the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.

(Psalms 104:40) 
You have made the moon to mark the seasons;

(Psalms 104:41) 
the sun knows its time for setting.

(Psalms 104:42) 
You make darkness, and it is night,

(Psalms 104:43) 
when all the beasts of the forest move about.

(Psalms 104:44) 
The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.

(Psalms 104:45) 
When the sun rises, they go away,

(Psalms 104:46) 
and lie down in their dens.

(Psalms 104:47) 
Man goes forth to his work

(Psalms 104:48) 
and to his labor until the evening.

(Psalms 104:49) 
How manifold are your works, O Lord!

(Psalms 104:50) 
In wisdom you have made them all;

(Psalms 104:51) 
the earth is full of your creatures.

(Psalms 104:52) 
Here is the sea, great and wide,

(Psalms 104:53) 
which teems with things innumerable,

(Psalms 104:54) 
living things both small and great.

(Psalms 104:55) 
There go the ships,

(Psalms 104:56) 
and Leviathan, which you formed to sport in it.

(Psalms 104:57) 
These all look to you, to give them their food in due season.

(Psalms 104:58) 
When you give to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.

(Psalms 104:59) 
When you hide your face, they are dismayed;

(Psalms 104:60) 
when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

(Psalms 104:61) 
When you send forth your spirit, they are created,

(Psalms 104:62) 
and you renew the face of the ground.

(Psalms 104:63) 
May the glory of the Lord endure for ever,

(Psalms 104:64) 
may the Lord rejoice in his works.

(Psalms 104:65) 
Who looks on the earth, and it trembles,

(Psalms 104:66) 
who touches the mountains, and they smoke!

(Psalms 104:67) 
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;

(Psalms 104:68) 
I will sing praise to my God while I have being.

(Psalms 104:69) 
May my meditation be pleasing to him,

(Psalms 104:70) 
for I will rejoice in the Lord.

(Psalms 104:71) 
Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and the wicked be no more.

(Psalms 104:72) 
Praise the Lord, my soul!

(Psalms 105:1) 
Praise the Lord, call on his name: announce among the nations his works.

(Psalms 105:2) 
Sing to him, and sing songs to him: tell all his marvelous acts.

(Psalms 105:3) 
Praise his holy name: let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice.

(Psalms 105:4) 
Seek the Lord and be made strong: always seek his face.

(Psalms 105:5) 
Remember the marvels he has made: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.

(Psalms 105:6) 
Offspring of Abraham, his servant: sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.

(Psalms 105:7) 
He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

(Psalms 105:8) 
He has remembered his covenant forever: the word he commanded to a thousand generations.

(Psalms 105:9) 
Which he arranged for Abraham: and his oath to Isaac:

(Psalms 105:10) 
And he established it for Jacob as a precept: and for Israel as an everlasting testament:

(Psalms 105:11) 
Saying: “To you I will give the land of Canaan: the measuring cord of your inheritance.”

(Psalms 105:12) 
When they were few in number: the fewest, and inhabitants of it:

(Psalms 105:13) 
And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.

(Psalms 105:14) 
He did not let any man hurt them: and he rebuked kings for them.

(Psalms 105:15) 
Do not touch my anointed ones: and do not mistreat my prophets.

(Psalms 105:16) 
And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke all the support of bread.

(Psalms 105:17) 
He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold as a slave.

(Psalms 105:18) 
They humbled his feet in chains: iron passed through his soul.

(Psalms 105:19) 
Until his word came: the word of the Lord set him ablaze.

(Psalms 105:20) 
He sent and released him: the king of the peoples set him free.

(Psalms 105:21) 
He established him as lord of his house: and prince over all his possessions:

(Psalms 105:22) 
That he might teach his princes like himself: and his elders wisdom.

(Psalms 105:23) 
And Israel entered Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Ham.

(Psalms 105:24) 
And he greatly increased his people: and made them stronger than their enemies.

(Psalms 105:25) 
He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants.

(Psalms 105:26) 
He sent Moses his servant: Aaron whom he chose for himself.

(Psalms 105:27) 
They placed among them the words of his signs: and his signs in the land of Ham.

(Psalms 105:28) 
He sent darkness, and it was darkened: and he did not exacerbate his words.

(Psalms 105:29) 
He turned their waters into blood: and killed their fish.

(Psalms 105:30) 
Their land brought forth frogs: in the inner chambers of their kings.

(Psalms 105:31) 
He spoke, and there came gnats: and gnats in all their borders.

(Psalms 105:32) 
He gave them hail for rain: fire burning in their land.

(Psalms 105:33) 
And he struck their vines and their fig trees: and broke the wood of their borders.

(Psalms 105:34) 
He spoke, and the locust came, and the caterpillar: of which there was no number.

(Psalms 105:35) 
And it ate every blade of grass in their land: and ate every fruit of their land.

(Psalms 105:36) 
And he struck every firstborn in their land: the first fruits of all their labor.

(Psalms 105:37) 
And he led them out with silver and gold: and not one weak person was among their tribes.

(Psalms 105:38) 
Egypt rejoiced in their departure: because the fear of them had fallen upon them.

(Psalms 105:39) 
He spread a cloud for their protection: and a fire to light them at night.

(Psalms 105:40) 
They asked, and the quail came: and he satisfied them with bread from the sky.

(Psalms 105:41) 
He split the rock, and waters flowed: in the desert: and they went out like rivers.

(Psalms 105:42) 
Because he remembered his holy word: which he spoke to Abraham his servant.

(Psalms 105:43) 
And he led out his people with exultation: and his chosen ones with joy.

(Psalms 105:44) 
And he gave them the lands of the nations: and they possessed the labors of the peoples:

(Psalms 105:45) 
That they might keep his ordinances: and seek his law.

(Psalms 105:46) 
Amen.

(Psalms 106:1) 
Give thanks to God, because He is good, because His mercy endures forever.

(Psalms 106:2) 
Let those who were saved by God declare it! He saved them from the hands of the enemy.

(Psalms 106:3) 
He gathered them from the ends of the earth, from the east and the west, the north and the sea.

(Psalms 106:4) 
They wandered in the desert, lost, without a way to reach a city where they could be safe.

(Psalms 106:5) 
They were hungry and thirsty, and their life nearly failed within them.

(Psalms 106:6) 
But they cried out to God in their distress, and He saved them from their troubles.

(Psalms 106:7) 
Then He led them on the right path, so that they could find the city where they could live.

(Psalms 106:8) 
Let them thank God for His mercy and for the wonders He does for all people:

(Psalms 106:9) 
He satisfies the thirsty and the hungry.

(Psalms 106:10) 
Some sat in darkness, bound in poverty and chains.

(Psalms 106:11) 
They rejected God's word and rejected the plan of the Most High.

(Psalms 106:12) 
Then their hearts were crushed by labor, they were weak, and there was no one to help them.

(Psalms 106:13) 
But they cried out to God in their distress, and He saved them from their troubles.

(Psalms 106:14) 
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their chains.

(Psalms 106:15) 
Let them thank God for His mercy and for the wonders He does for all people:

(Psalms 106:16) 
He shattered the bronze gates, and broke the iron bars.

(Psalms 106:17) 
Some were punished for their sinful ways, because of their iniquities.

(Psalms 106:18) 
They abhorred all food, and came close to the gates of death.

(Psalms 106:19)

(Psalms 106:20) 
He sent out His word and healed them, saving them from destruction.

(Psalms 106:21) 
Let them thank God for His mercy and for the wonders He does for all people:

(Psalms 106:22) 
Let them offer sacrifices of praise, and declare His works with joy.

(Psalms 106:23) 
Some sail the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters,

(Psalms 106:24) 
They saw God's works, and His wonders in the deep.

(Psalms 106:25) 
He commanded, and a stormy wind arose, lifting up the waves.

(Psalms 106:26) 
They were tossed up to the sky, and plunged down to the depths; their souls melted away in their troubles.

(Psalms 106:27) 
They reeled and staggered like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was consumed.

(Psalms 106:28) 
Then they cried out to God in their distress, and He brought them out of their troubles.

(Psalms 106:29) 
He stilled the storm and caused the waves to cease.

(Psalms 106:30) 
They rejoiced because it was calm, and He led them to the harbor they desired.

(Psalms 106:31) 
Let them thank God for His mercy and for the wonders He does for all people:

(Psalms 106:32)

(Psalms 106:33) 
He turned rivers into a desert and springs of water into thirst.

(Psalms 106:34) 
He turned fertile land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who live there.

(Psalms 106:35) 
He turned the desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water.

(Psalms 106:36) 
And there He let the hungry dwell, and they founded a city to live in.

(Psalms 106:37) 
They sowed fields, planted vineyards, and reaped a fruitful harvest.

(Psalms 106:38) 
He blessed them and they multiplied greatly, and He did not decrease their livestock.

(Psalms 106:39) 
But then they were few, and oppressed by trouble and sorrow.

(Psalms 106:40) 
He poured contempt upon princes, and caused them to wander in a pathless waste.

(Psalms 106:41) 
But He lifted up the poor and needy out of their suffering.

(Psalms 106:42) 
The righteous saw and rejoiced, and all wickedness closed its mouth.

(Psalms 106:43) 
Whoever is wise will consider these things, and will understand the goodness of God.

(Psalms 107:2) 
Let them say this, those who have been redeemed by the Lord, those whom He redeemed from the hand of the enemy,

(Psalms 107:3) 
and gathered from every place on the earth, from the rising and setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.

(Psalms 107:4) 
They wandered in a desert, on the wrong paths. They didn't find any city to dwell in.

(Psalms 107:5)

(Psalms 107:10) 
Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in poverty and in chains,

(Psalms 107:11) 
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and scorned the counsel of the Most High.

(Psalms 107:12) 
He humbled their hearts through labor: they were weakened, and there was no one to help.

(Psalms 107:13) 
Then they cried out to the Lord in their suffering, and He saved them from their distress.

(Psalms 107:14) 
He led them out of darkness and the shadow of death: and broke their chains.

(Psalms 107:15)

Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing business in many waters,

(Psalms 107:24) 
They saw the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.

(Psalms 107:25) 
He spoke, and the stormy wind stood still: and the waves of the sea rose up.

(Psalms 107:26) 
They ascended to the heavens, and descended to the depths: their soul melted away with trouble.

(Psalms 107:27) 
They were troubled, and moved like a drunken man: and all their wisdom was consumed.

(Psalms 107:28) 
Then they cried out to the Lord in their suffering, and He brought them out of their distress.

(Psalms 107:29) 
He established their storm into a breeze: and the waves were still.

(Psalms 107:30) 
And they rejoiced that they were still: and He led them to the harbor they desired.

(Psalms 107:31) 
Let them thank the Lord for His mercy, and His wonders for the children of men.

(Psalms 107:32)

(Psalms 107:34) 
He turned the fruitful land into a salt marsh: because of the wickedness of those who lived there.

(Psalms 107:35) 
He turned the desert into pools of water: and the land without water into springs of water.

(Psalms 107:36) 
And He settled the hungry there: and they established a city to live in.

(Psalms 107:37) 
And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and produced fruits for their crops.

(Psalms 107:38) 
And He blessed them, and they multiplied greatly: and He did not diminish their livestock.

(Psalms 107:39) 
Then they were reduced to a few, and they were afflicted by the tribulation of evils, and by sorrow.

(Psalms 107:40) 
Contempt was poured out on the leaders: and He caused them to wander in the pathless way, and not on the road.

(Psalms 107:41) 
But He helped the poor from their poverty: and made their families like sheep.

(Psalms 107:42) 
The upright will see this, and they will rejoice: and all wickedness will shut its mouth.

(Psalms 107:43) 
Who is wise, and will observe these things? And will understand the mercies of the Lord.

(Psalms 108:1) 
A hymn of David. O God, keep singing my praises, and do not be silent: for the mouth of the sinner, and the mouth of the deceitful, is opened against me.

(Psalms 108:2) 
With a lying tongue, they spoke against me, and with words of hatred, they surrounded me: and they fought against me for nothing.

(Psalms 108:3)

(Psalms 108:4) 
And they repaid me with evil for good, and hatred for my love.

(Psalms 108:11) 
Let there be no one to help him: nor let there be anyone to pity his orphans.

(Psalms 108:12) 
Let his children be devoted to destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out.

(Psalms 108:13) 
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

(Psalms 108:14) 
Let them be always against the Lord: and let the memory of them perish from the earth.

(Psalms 108:15) 
Because he did not remember to show mercy, but persecuted the poor man and the beggar, and broke the heart of the afflicted until death.

(Psalms 108:16) 
And he loved cursing, and it will come to him: and he did not want blessing, and it will be far from him.

(Psalms 108:17) 
And he put on cursing as a garment: and it entered like water into his inner self, and like oil into his bones.

(Psalms 108:18) 
May it be to him like the garment with which he is covered, and like the belt with which he is always girded.

(Psalms 108:21) 
Deliver me, because I am needy and poor: and my heart is troubled within me.

(Psalms 108:22) 
I have been taken away like a shadow when it is extended: and I have been shaken off like locusts.

(Psalms 108:23) 
My knees have been weakened by fasting: and my flesh has been changed because of oil.

(Psalms 108:24) 
And I have become a reproach to them: they saw me, and shook their heads.

(Psalms 108:25) 
Help me, O Lord my God: save me according to your mercy.

(Psalms 108:26) 
And let them know that this is your hand: and you, O Lord, have done it.

(Psalms 108:27) 
Let them curse, but you bless: let those who rise up against me be confounded: but your servant will rejoice.

(Psalms 108:28) 
Let those who detract from me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered as with a double cloak of their own confusion.

(Psalms 108:29)

(Psalms 111:7) 
so as to give them the inheritance of the gentiles.

Our feet were standing in your courtyards, O Jerusalem.

(Psalms 122:4) 
Jerusalem is built as a city, all joined together:

(Psalms 122:5) 
There the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as it was the testimony of Israel, to give praise to the name of the Lord.

(Psalms 124:2) 
If the Lord hadn't been on our side when men rose up against us,

(Psalms 124:3) 
they would have swallowed us alive when their fury blazed against us.

(Psalms 124:4) 
The flood waters might have drowned us.

(Psalms 124:5) 
The torrent of their anger surged over our souls.

(Psalms 124:6) 
We might have been swept away by an intolerable flood.

(Psalms 124:7) 
Blessed be the Lord, who didn't give us as prey to their teeth.

(Psalms 125:1) 
A song of the steps.

(Psalms 125:2) 
“If the Lord hadn't been on our side,” let Israel say:

(Psalms 125:3) 
“If the Lord hadn't been on our side when men rose up against us,”

(Psalms 125:4) 
They would have swallowed us alive then.

(Psalms 125:5) 
Maybe the flood waters would have washed us away.

Our soul passed through the great rushing waters.

(Psalms 125:7)

(Psalms 125:11) 
Our help is in the name of the Lord, the one who made the universe and the earth.

(Psalms 126:1) 
A song of the steps. When the Lord returned the captives of Zion, we were like men dreaming.

(Psalms 126:3) 
The Lord has done great things with us: we were filled with joy.

(Psalms 126:4) 
Turn back our captivity, O Lord, as in the torrents of the south.

(Psalms 126:5) 
Those who sow in tears, shall reap in exultation.

(Psalms 126:6) 
They went forth weeping, casting seeds. But they will come again with happiness, carrying their sheaves.

(Psalms 127:1) 
A Song of Ascents. If the Lord does not build a house, then those who build it have labored in vain. If the Lord does not protect a city, then the watchman guards it in vain.

(Psalms 127:2) 
It is useless for you to get up early; rise only after you have been seated, you who eat the bread of sorrow.

(Psalms 127:3) 
When He gives sleep to those He loves, a heritage from the Lord is given. Sons are a reward, the fruit of the womb.

(Psalms 127:4) 
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one’s youth.

(Psalms 127:5) 
Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them! They will not be shamed when they speak to their enemies in the gate.

(Psalms 128:1)

May you see your children's children, and may there be peace upon Israel.

(Psalms 129:1) 
From the depths of trouble, I cry to You, Lord:

(Psalms 129:2) 
Lord, hear my voice.

(Psalms 129:3) 
May Your ears be open to the sound of my supplication.

(Psalms 129:4) 
If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who shall stand?

(Psalms 129:5) 
But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared, Lord.

(Psalms 129:6) 
My soul has relied upon His Word. My soul has hoped in the Lord.

(Psalms 129:7) 
From the morning watch until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.

(Psalms 129:8) 
Because with the Lord there is mercy and His redemption is plentiful.

(Psalms 129:9) 
And He will redeem Israel from all their iniquities.

(Psalms 130:1) 
From the deepest part of the sea of troubles, I call to You, Lord:

(Psalms 130:2) 
Lord, hear my voice.

(Psalms 130:3) 
Let Your ears be attentive to the sound of my prayers.

(Psalms 130:4) 
If You, Lord, kept a record of sins,

(Psalms 130:5) 
Lord, who can possibly stand before You?

(Psalms 130:6) 
But there is forgiveness with You,

(Psalms 130:7) 
so we may fear and obey Your laws, Lord.

(Psalms 130:8) 
My soul has waited on His promise,

(Psalms 130:9) 
my soul has hoped in the Lord.

(Psalms 130:10) 
From morning watch until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.

(Psalms 130:11) 
For there is mercy with the Lord, and redemption is abundant with Him.

(Psalms 130:12) 
And He will redeem Israel from all of his sins.

(Psalms 131:1) 
Lord, my heart is not puffed up with pride, nor have my eyes turned to arrogance.

(Psalms 131:2) 
I have not occupied myself with great things, nor with wonders beyond my ability.

(Psalms 131:3) 
Indeed, if I was not humble, but haughty in my thoughts:

(Psalms 131:4) 
as a weaned child on its mother's lap, so is my soul.

(Psalms 131:5) 
Let Israel hope in the Lord, now and forever.

(Psalms 132:1) 
A song of ascents. Remember, O Lord, David, and all his meekness.

(Psalms 132:2) 
How he swore an oath to the Lord and promised a vow to the God of Jacob:

(Psalms 132:3) 
“I will not enter into my house, nor will I go up to my bed,

(Psalms 132:4) 
I will not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids,

(Psalms 132:5) 
nor rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.”

(Psalms 132:6) 
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah: we found it in the fields of the forest.

(Psalms 132:7) 
Let us go into his tabernacle; let us worship in the place where his feet stood.

(Psalms 132:8) 
Arise, O Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your holiness.

(Psalms 132:9) 
Let your priests be clothed with justice, and let your holy ones rejoice.

(Psalms 132:10) 
For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your Christ.

(Psalms 132:11) 
The Lord swore to David in truth, and He will not change His mind: “From the fruit of your womb I will set upon your throne.”

(Psalms 132:12) 
“If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I will teach them, then their sons also will sit upon your throne forever.”

(Psalms 132:13) 
For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has chosen it to be His dwelling.

(Psalms 132:14)

I will bless her widow and bless her poor with bread.

I will clothe his enemies with shame, but upon him my holiness will flourish.

(Psalms 133:1) 
A song of ascents. How very good and how very pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity.

(Psalms 133:2) 
It is like the most precious oil that was poured on the head, that ran down the beard, the beard of Aaron, running down his garment’s collar.

(Psalms 133:3) 
It is like the dew of Hermon that falls on Mount Zion, for there the Lord has commanded the blessing and life forevermore.

For the Lord will judge His people, and will have compassion on His servants.

(Psalms 134:16) 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of human hands.

(Psalms 134:17) 
They have mouths, but they don't speak; they have eyes, but they don't see.

(Psalms 134:18) 
They have ears, but they don't hear; there is no breath in their mouths.

Those who make them are like them, and so are all who trust in them.

(Psalms 134:20)

By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.

(Psalms 137:2) 
We hung our instruments of music in the willows there.

(Psalms 137:3) 
For there, those who had taken us captive asked for a song, and those who had led us away asked for a hymn.

(Psalms 137:4) 
Sing us one of the songs of Zion!

(Psalms 137:5) 
How can we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?

(Psalms 137:6) 
If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand be forgotten!

(Psalms 137:7) 
If I do not remember you, if I do not prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy...

(Psalms 137:8) 
Lord, remember the children of Edom on the day of Jerusalem, who said: "Raze it, raze it, down to its foundation."

(Psalms 137:9) 
O daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction: blessed is he who repays you for what you have done to us!

(Psalms 137:10) 
Blessed is he who seizes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!

(Psalms 138:1) 
Lord, you put me to the test, and I know that you know me.

(Psalms 138:2) 
You know when I sit down, and when I stand up;

(Psalms 138:3) 
You read my thoughts from afar.

(Psalms 138:4) 
You have surveyed my path and my journey;

(Psalms 138:5) 
and you have foreseen all my ways.

(Psalms 138:6) 
Because before the words come out of my mouth, you know them completely, Lord.

(Psalms 138:7) 
You formed me from the very beginning, and you have always been present.

(Psalms 138:8) 
This is a great wonder to me;

(Psalms 138:9) 
it is so powerful, and I can't begin to comprehend it.

(Psalms 138:10) 
Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I flee from your face?

(Psalms 138:11) 
If I ascend into the sky, you are there;

(Psalms 138:12) 
if I go down to hell, you are there.

(Psalms 138:13) 
If I fly to the ends of the earth and take wings in the morning,

(Psalms 138:14) 
even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me.

(Psalms 138:15) 
And I said, "Surely darkness will conceal me;"

(Psalms 138:16) 
and night will be my light in my pleasure.

(Psalms 138:17) 
Even darkness isn't dark to you, and night is as bright as the day: both the darkness and the light are the same to you.

(Psalms 138:18) 
For you have made me;

(Psalms 138:19) 
you have received me in my mother's womb.

(Psalms 138:20) 
I will praise you, because you are a wonderful, amazing God;

(Psalms 138:21) 
your works are miraculous, and my soul knows this well.

(Psalms 138:22) 
My body was not hidden from you when I was being formed secretly;

(Psalms 138:23) 
and all parts of my body were being made in the depths of the earth.

(Psalms 138:24) 
Your eyes saw my imperfection, and in your book all things were written;

(Psalms 138:25) 
the days of my life have been formed, and not one of them is without you.

(Psalms 138:26) 
And how precious to me are your friends, O God! How powerful are their leaders!

(Psalms 138:27) 
I will count them, and they will increase more than the sand: if I rise up, I am still with you.

(Psalms 138:28) 
If you slay the wicked, God, men of bloodshed, get away from me:

(Psalms 138:29)

(Psalms 138:30) 
Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord? Am I not grieved for your enemies?

(Psalms 138:31) 
I hated them with perfect hatred: they have become my enemies.

(Psalms 138:32) 
Examine me, God, and know my heart; test me, and know my ways.

(Psalms 138:33) 
And see if there is any path of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way everlasting.

(Psalms 139:1) 
O Lord, you have examined me, and you have known me.

(Psalms 139:2) 
You know my sitting and my rising.

(Psalms 139:3) 
You have understood my thoughts from afar.

(Psalms 139:4) 
You have investigated my path, and my measuring cord.

(Psalms 139:5) 
And you have seen all my ways. Because there is no word in my tongue.

(Psalms 139:6) 
Behold, O Lord, you have known all things new and old.

(Psalms 139:7) 
You have made me, and put your hand upon me.

(Psalms 139:8) 
Your knowledge has become wonderful and mysterious, and I cannot attain it.

(Psalms 139:9) 
Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your face?

(Psalms 139:10) 
If I go up into the sky, you are there. If I go down into the underworld, you are there.

(Psalms 139:11) 
If I take my wings in the morning, and dwell in the farthest parts of the sea,

(Psalms 139:12) 
Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me.

(Psalms 139:13) 
And if I say: Perhaps the darkness will overwhelm me: and night will be my illumination in my delights:

(Psalms 139:14) 
Even the darkness will not be hidden from you, and night will be illuminated like day. As is its darkness, so is its light.

(Psalms 139:15) 
For you have possessed my kidneys: you have taken me from my mother's womb.

(Psalms 139:16) 
I will give you praise: because you have been fearfully magnified. Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows this exceedingly well.

(Psalms 139:17) 
My bone was not hidden from you, that you have made in secret: and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.

(Psalms 139:18) 
Your eyes have seen my imperfection, and in your book all are written: days will be formed, and there will be none among them.

(Psalms 139:19) 
But to me, your friends are greatly honored, O God: their leadership is greatly strengthened.

(Psalms 139:20) 
I will count them, and they will be multiplied above the sand: I have risen, and I am still with you.

(Psalms 139:21) 
If, O God, you will kill the sinners: men of blood, seek blood from me.

(Psalms 139:22) 
Who say in thought: We will take your cities in vain.

(Psalms 139:23) 
Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord? And do I not waste away because of your enemies?

(Psalms 139:24) 
I hated them with a perfect hatred: they have become my enemies.

(Psalms 139:25) 
Test me, O God, and know my heart: question me, and know my ways.

(Psalms 139:26) 
And see if the way of iniquity is in me: and lead me in the way everlasting.

(Psalms 140:9) 
They will hear my words and understand that they could not resist my prayer, as the very earth cracked open. Their bones are scattered according to the grave.

Let me not take part in the works of the evildoers. May I not be numbered among them.

(Psalms 141:6) 
The just man will strike me with mercy and will rebuke me. But the oil of the sinner will not anoint my head.

(Psalms 141:7) 
For even in their evil prayers, their judges have been swallowed up in the rock.

(Psalms 141:8) 
My words are heard for they have prevailed. Like the earth, they are upon the earth. Their bones are scattered near hell.

For my eyes are turned to You, Lord. I have hoped in You, do not take away my soul.

(Psalms 141:10)
