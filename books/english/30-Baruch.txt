(Baruch 1:1) 
These are the words written in this book by Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Zedekiah, the son of Sedei, the son of Hilkiah, while he was in Babylon.

(Baruch 1:2) 
This happened in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, during the period when the Chaldeans had captured Jerusalem and burned the city with fire.

(Baruch 1:3) 
Baruch read the words of this book aloud for Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and for all the people who had come to listen to the book.

(Baruch 1:4) 
He read it for the nobles, the sons of kings, the elders, and for all the people—from the least important to the most important—everyone who was living in Babylon by the Sodi River.

(Baruch 1:5) 
When the people heard these words, they wept. They fasted and prayed in the presence of the Lord.

(Baruch 1:6) 
They also collected money, each person contributing what they could.

(Baruch 1:7) 
They sent this money to Jerusalem, to Jehoiakim the priest, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum. It was also sent to the other priests and to all the people who were with him in Jerusalem.

(Baruch 1:8) 
This happened after Baruch received the vessels from the Lord’s Temple, which had been carried away from it. He was to bring them back to the land of Judah. This occurred on the tenth day of the month of Sivan. These were the silver vessels that Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, had made for the Temple.

(Baruch 1:9) 
All this took place after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had captured Jeconiah, along with the princes, the other captives, the powerful men, and the common people of the land from Jerusalem, and had led them all away into Babylon.

(Baruch 1:10) 
And the people in Babylon sent this message: 'We have sent you money. Use it to buy burnt offerings, incense, and grain offerings, and make sacrifices for sin. Then, pray for us yourselves to the Lord our God.'

(Baruch 1:11) 
They said this because, 'we have sinned before the Lord our God. We did not trust in Him enough to listen to the voice of the Lord our God.'

(Baruch 1:12) 
We stubbornly resisted the commands that the Lord gave to us, right before our very eyes.

(Baruch 1:13) 
Because of this, we have been subjected to all these evils and scourges to this very day—everything that the Lord has brought upon us and upon all of Israel. This punishment came upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, and our fathers.

(Baruch 1:14) 
We have continued to sin before the Lord our God by not trusting Him, and by not listening attentively to His voice.

(Baruch 1:15) 
The consequences of these evils have become manifest for us and for our fathers, even to this very day.

(Baruch 1:16) 
The Lord brought upon us all these evils, exactly as He had warned us He would.

(Baruch 1:17) 
We did not seek the favor of the Lord our God, so that each of us might turn away from our very wicked ways.

(Baruch 1:18) 
The Lord was vigilant in bringing these evils upon us, because the Lord is just in all His works and in all that He commanded us.

(Baruch 1:19) 
We did not obey His voice by walking in the precepts of our Lord that He gave to us.

(Baruch 1:20) 
From the day the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt until this very day, we have been faithless to the Lord our God. We have been scattered because of our many iniquities and our persistent defiance, for we have sinned in the sight of the Lord our God.

(Baruch 1:21) 
The evils and curses that the Lord ordained through His servant Moses have clung to us. These were decreed on the day He brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, when He promised to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, and these curses have been fulfilled and persist even to this day.

(Baruch 1:22) 
We did not obey the voice of the Lord our God, despite all the words of the prophets whom He sent to us.

(Baruch 1:23) 
Instead, each one followed the wicked imagination of his own heart, offering sacrifices to foreign gods and doing evil in the sight of the Lord our God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:1) 
This is why the Lord heard our cries and laments that we made before Him, because we had sinned against Him.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:2) 
And He brought upon us the disaster that the Lord had commanded against us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:3) 
And the Lord drove us from our own land, sending us to the nations where He scattered us, and all our friends were made distant from us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:4) 
And we were made subject to others, living in misery and in all ignominy because of the curse that He had placed on us, just as He had done to our enemies.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:5) 
We did not obey the voice of the Lord our God to walk in His commandments, which He had given to us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:6) 
The time of evil fell upon us, when the Lord sent His judgment upon Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:7) 
He brought upon us what was written in the book of the Law of Moses and of the Covenant, that a man would eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of his own daughter.—This refers to the extreme famine and cannibalism during sieges, as predicted in Deuteronomy 28:53-57.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:8) 
And He gave them over to the subjection of all the kingdoms around us, to be a reproach and a desolation among every people where the Lord had scattered us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:9) 
And we became the lowest, not the highest, because we sinned against the Lord our God by not obeying His voice.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:10) 
And our Lord is just. But we and our fathers are put to shame today.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:11) 
All these words came upon us, which the Lord spoke to us, and to our judges who judged Israel, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to every man of Israel and Judah.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:12) 
So that He might bring great evils upon us, such as have not been done under the sky—meaning the whole created order—just as they were done in Jerusalem, according to those things written in the Law of Moses.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:13) 
So that a man would eat the flesh of his own son and the flesh of his own daughter.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:14) 
And He gave them over to the subjection of all the kingdoms around us, to be a reproach and a desolation among every people where the Lord had scattered us.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:15) 
And we became the lowest, not the highest, because we sinned against the Lord our God by not obeying His voice.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:16) 
And our Lord is just. But we and our fathers are put to shame today.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:17) 
Behold, we have been made in every land where You have scattered us into a reproach, a curse, and a state of sin, according to all the iniquities of our fathers who turned away from You, O Lord our God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:18) 
Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life; receive them with your ears, so that you may know true wisdom.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:19) 
What is it, O Israel, that you are in the land of your enemies? You have grown old in a foreign land; you have been defiled among the dead, esteemed among those who go down to the place of the dead?—Referring to the state of exile and spiritual death, not literally among corpses.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:20) 
You have abandoned the fountain of wisdom.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:21) 
For if you had walked in the way of God, you would surely have lived in peace in the land.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:22) 
Learn where wisdom is, where strength is, where understanding is, so that you may also know where length of days is, and life, where the light of the eyes is, and peace.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:23) 
Who has found her place? And who has entered her treasures?

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:24) 
Or who has ascended into the universe and taken her, or brought her down from the clouds?—Using 'universe' here for *caelum* to denote the vastness of creation, implying wisdom is not found by physical exploration of space.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:25) 
Or who has crossed the sea and found her, or brought her forth as treasures?

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:26) 
No one knows her ways, nor anyone who grasps her.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:27) 
But He who knows all things knows her, and has found her by His own understanding.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:28) 
He who prepared the earth in eternal time, and filled it with four-footed beasts and flying creatures.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:29) 
He who fills the sea and appointed it for its boundaries.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:30) 
He who also called the stars by their names.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:31) 
He who also sends forth lightnings, and they appear; and their voices (thunder) are heard in their appointed office (purpose).

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:32) 
He who opened the treasures and brought them forth like birds.—Referring to divine actions like bringing forth rain, wind, or other elements from hidden 'treasures' of creation.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:33) 
He gave the way of understanding, and showed it to His servant Jacob and to His beloved Israel.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:34) 
After these things, He (Wisdom, personified as God's Word) was seen on the earth and lived among men.—This foreshadows the Incarnation of Christ, as Wisdom is often personified as the Word of God.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:35) 
This is the book of the commandments of God, and the Law, which endures forever.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:36) 
All who hold fast to it lead to life; all who abandon it lead to death.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:37) 
Turn back, O Jacob, and grasp her (Wisdom); walk in her way, shining brightly in her sight, in clarity against her light.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:38) 
Do not give your glory to another, nor your dignity to a foreign nation.

(Baruch 2:Baruch 2:39) 
Behold, we are blessed, O Israel, because what is pleasing to God is known to us.

(Baruch 3:1) 
And now, Lord Almighty, God of Israel, my soul is in deep distress, and my anxious spirit cries out to You.

(Baruch 3:2) 
Hear us, Lord, and have mercy, because we have sinned before You.

(Baruch 3:3) 
For You abide eternally, but we perish because of our sins in this earthly age.

(Baruch 3:4) 
Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the Israelites who are like the dead, and the prayer of their children, who have sinned against You and did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. Because of this disobedience, all these evils have clung to us.

(Baruch 3:5) 
Do not remember the iniquities of our fathers, but remember Your powerful hand and Your holy name in this time of our need.

(Baruch 3:6) 
Because You are our Lord God, and we will praise You, O Lord.

(Baruch 3:7) 
For this reason, You have placed Your reverence within our hearts, so that we may call upon Your holy name and praise You in our captivity. We have turned away from the iniquity of our fathers, who sinned against You.

(Baruch 3:8) 
And behold, here we are today in our captivity, where You have dispersed us as an object of reproach, a curse, and suffering the consequences of sin, according to all the iniquities of our fathers who turned away from You, O Lord our God.

(Baruch 3:9) 
Hear, O Israel, the commands that lead to life; listen attentively so that you may know true wisdom.

(Baruch 3:10) 
Why is it, O Israel, that you find yourself in the land of your enemies?

(Baruch 3:11) 
You have grown old in a foreign land. You have become defiled among those who are spiritually dead.

(Baruch 3:12) 
You have been counted among those who are descending into spiritual ruin and the underworld.

(Baruch 3:13) 
You abandoned the fountain of true wisdom.

(Baruch 3:14) 
For if you had walked in the way of God, you would surely have lived in peace throughout all ages.

(Baruch 3:15) 
Learn where true wisdom is found, where virtue resides, and where understanding exists, so that you may also know where length of days and life are, and where the light for your eyes and peace are.

(Baruch 3:16) 
Who has ever found the place where wisdom dwells? And who has entered into her hidden treasures?

(Baruch 3:17) 
Where are the rulers of the nations, and those who dominated the beasts that are upon the earth, and those who delighted in controlling the birds of the sky?

(Baruch 3:18) 
Where are those who hoard silver and gold, in which people place their trust, and whose endless acquisitions have no limit? Where are those who work with silver, constantly anxious, yet their works bring no true discovery or fulfillment?

(Baruch 3:19) 
They have been destroyed and descended into the underworld, and others have risen in their place.

(Baruch 3:20) 
Young people saw the light of the world and lived upon the earth, but they did not know the way of true instruction and wisdom.

(Baruch 3:21) 
Nor did they understand its paths; nor did their children embrace it. The way of wisdom became distant from them.

(Baruch 3:22) 
Wisdom was not heard of in the land of Canaan, nor was it seen in Teman.

(Baruch 3:23) 
Even the descendants of Hagar, who seek worldly wisdom from the earth, the merchants of the land and Teman, and the storytellers, and the seekers of worldly prudence and understanding—they did not know the way of God, nor were they mindful of His paths.

(Baruch 3:24) 
O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how immense is the place of His possession!

(Baruch 3:25) 
It is great, and has no end; it is lofty and immeasurable.

(Baruch 3:26) 
There were the famous giants, those who existed from the beginning, great in stature and skilled in warfare.

(Baruch 3:27) 
The Lord did not choose these giants, nor did He give them the way of true instruction.

(Baruch 3:28) 
And for that reason, they perished. Because they did not possess wisdom, they were destroyed because of their own folly.

(Baruch 3:29) 
Who has ascended into the sky to obtain wisdom, and brought it down from the clouds?

(Baruch 3:30) 
Who has crossed the great sea and found wisdom, then brought it back, even for the most precious gold?

(Baruch 3:31) 
There is no one among humanity who knows wisdom's way, nor anyone who can grasp her paths.

(Baruch 3:32) 
But He who knows all things, He alone knows wisdom. He found it through His own prudence—He who prepared the earth to endure eternally and filled it with livestock and every kind of four-footed creature.

(Baruch 3:33) 
He who sends forth light, and it travels forth; He called it, and it obeyed Him with awe and trembling.

(Baruch 3:34) 
The stars give their light in their appointed stations, and they rejoice.

(Baruch 3:35) 
They were called, and they answered, "Here we are!" And they shone with joy for Him who made them.

(Baruch 3:36) 
This is our God, and no other will be esteemed as equal to Him.

(Baruch 3:37) 
He is the one who discovered every way of true instruction and wisdom, and He handed it over to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved.

(Baruch 3:38) 
After these things, Wisdom Himself, God the Son, was seen on the earth, and He lived among mankind.

(Baruch 4:1) 
This is the law of God, the word of His mouth, His statutes, and His judgments. Everyone who keeps these divine commands will find eternal life; but those who abandon them will find only death.

(Baruch 4:2) 
Return, O Jacob, and take hold of this Law. Walk in the way of its splendor, in the presence of its guiding light.

(Baruch 4:3) 
Do not surrender your glory to another nation, nor your honor to a foreign people.

(Baruch 4:4) 
We are truly blessed, O Israel, because the things that please God are known to us, His chosen people.

(Baruch 4:5) 
Take courage, My people, O Israel, remember the covenant God made with you.

(Baruch 4:6) 
You were handed over to foreign nations, not for your total destruction, but because of God's righteous anger at your sins. Your enemies then heaped insults upon you.

(Baruch 4:7) 
For you provoked Him who created you—God, the Eternal One—when you sacrificed to demons and not to God.

(Baruch 4:8) 
For you forgot God, who nourished you and sustained your life. And in doing so, you grieved Jerusalem, the Holy City that sustained its own people.

(Baruch 4:9) 
For Jerusalem, personified as a mother, saw the wrath of God coming upon you, her children. And she cried out: 'Listen, you neighboring cities of Zion, for God has brought great sorrow upon me!'

(Baruch 4:10) 
For I have seen the captivity of my people—my sons and my daughters—which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:11) 
Indeed, I raised them with joy and gladness; but now I have sent them away in weeping and mourning.

(Baruch 4:12) 
Let no one rejoice over me, for I am a widow and utterly desolate. I sit in desolation because of the sins of my children, for they turned away from the Law of God.

(Baruch 4:13) 
They neither knew His judgments, nor did they walk in His precepts. They abandoned the very path of God's commandments.

(Baruch 4:14) 
Come, you neighboring cities of Zion, and truly witness this: for God has brought great sorrow upon me.

(Baruch 4:15) 
For I have seen the captivity of my people—my sons and my daughters—which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:16) 
They departed, weeping, as they marched along the road. For they were led away by their enemies, barefoot and in utter disgrace.

(Baruch 4:17) 
Take courage, O Jerusalem, for a great joy from God is coming to you.

(Baruch 4:18) 
For the very One who brought these terrible troubles upon you will also take away all your bitterness and sorrow at the proper time.

(Baruch 4:19) 
The Eternal God will send you spiritual healing and true righteousness, brought forth by His mighty power.

(Baruch 4:20) 
Pay close attention, you neighboring cities of Zion, and remember the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Eternal God brought upon them.

(Baruch 4:21) 
For just as your enemy destroyed your children, so too will this same enemy swiftly witness its own destruction, and you, Jerusalem, will rejoice over its downfall.

(Baruch 4:22) 
For just as your enemies grieved over your forced separation from your land and people, so also will you rejoice over their complete destruction.

(Baruch 4:23) 
For God Himself will lead you back on a smooth and easy path, illuminated by the joy of His own Divine Light, and He will do so with His boundless mercy and perfect justice.

(Baruch 4:24) 
For just as you once eagerly strayed from God, now you must hasten to gather yourselves together and seek Him out, doing so with ten times the diligence you once showed in abandoning Him.

(Baruch 4:25) 
For the very One who permitted these evils to come upon you—He Himself will again bring you eternal joy along with your full salvation.

(Baruch 4:26) 
Take courage, O Jerusalem, for the One who gave you your name, and who knows you intimately, will indeed comfort you.

(Baruch 4:27) 
Woe to those miserable ones who plundered you, O Jerusalem, and who rejoiced over your ruin.

(Baruch 4:28) 
Woe to those wretched cities where your people were forced to serve as slaves! And woe to that city, Babylon, which took your children as captives.

(Baruch 4:29) 
For just as that city rejoiced over your ruin and exulted in your downfall, so too will she be utterly grieved in her own desolation.

(Baruch 4:30) 
And I will take away the joy of her many inhabitants, and her exultation will be transformed into deep mourning.

(Baruch 4:31) 
For a divine fire of judgment will come upon her from the Eternal God, and she will become a dwelling place for demons for all time to come.

(Baruch 4:32) 
Look around, O Jerusalem, turn your gaze toward the East, and behold the great joy that is coming to you from God.

(Baruch 4:33) 
For behold, your children are returning! Those whom you sent away dispersed are now coming, gathered from the rising of the sun to its setting—all at the command of the Holy One, rejoicing in the honor and glory of God.

(Baruch 4:34) 
Cast off, O Jerusalem, the garments of your mourning and your deep affliction! Instead, clothe yourself in the everlasting beauty and honor that God bestows upon you.

(Baruch 4:35) 
Envelop yourself with the double robe of righteousness, which comes directly from God. And place a glorious diadem upon your head, in honor of the Eternal God.

(Baruch 4:36) 
For God will indeed rejoice in your renewed beauty and splendor, and this joy will last for all eternity.

(Baruch 4:37) 
For God Himself will complete your deliverance with great joy, a deliverance coming directly from Him, your Divine Liberator.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:1) 
Strip yourself, Jerusalem (representing God's people), of your garments of sorrow and the state of your affliction. Instead, clothe yourself in the everlasting beauty and glory of God's grace, which He has given to you.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:2) 
Clothe yourself with a double garment of His divine justice, which comes from God. And place a crown upon your head to honor the Almighty God, the Powerful One.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:3) 
For God will manifest His radiant glory through you to everyone on the face of the earth, throughout the entire world.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:4) 
For by your own name, Jerusalem, God will name you forever: 'Peace of Justice' and 'the Glory of Holiness'.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:5) 
Rise up, Jerusalem, and stand on the highest point, filled with God's glory. Look all around you to the east, and see all your children gathered. They are coming from every direction, from the sunrise in the east to the sunset in the west. They have been gathered by the Word of the Holy One, and they rejoice in the memory of God's faithfulness.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:6) 
Your children were taken from you on foot, suffering humiliation as your enemies led them away. But the Lord God will bring them back to you. They will be carried with great honor, like rightful children of the Divine Kingdom.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:7) 
For God will lower every high mountain. And He will fill every valley and level all the rough and uneven ground. He does this so that the people of Israel may walk with dignity and honor, illuminated by the glory of God.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:8) 
Moreover, the forests and every pleasant tree will provide shade for Israel, making their journey comfortable, all by the express command of God.

(Baruch 5:Baruch 5:9) 
For God will lead the people of Israel back with great rejoicing, illuminated by the glorious light of His divine majesty. He will do this with the infinite mercy and perfect justice that originate from Him alone.

(Baruch 6:1) 
Because of the sins you committed against God, you will be taken as captives into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Babylonians.

(Baruch 6:2) 
Therefore, once you have entered Babylon, you will remain there for many years, for a long time—for as many as seven generations. After this period, I will lead you out of that place and give you peace.

(Baruch 6:3) 
But now, in Babylon, you will see their gods made of gold, silver, wood, and stone. These idols are portable, carried by people, and they are themselves objects of fear, or cause fear in their worshippers.

(Baruch 6:4) 
See to it, then, that you do not become like these foreign peoples. Do not be terrified by their fear and fall into their idol worship.

(Baruch 6:5) 
Instead, when you see crowds of people around you and behind you, worshipping these idols, you must say in your hearts: 'You alone are to be adored, Lord.'

(Baruch 6:6) 
For My angel is with you, and I will indeed demand an accounting for your souls.

(Baruch 6:7) 
These idols have their tongues polished and fashioned with great care from wood, and even from gold and silver, yet they are dressed with these. But the people who make them do not realize these idols are mere clay, and they cannot speak.

(Baruch 6:8) 
They have ears, just like a human, but they cannot hear. They have eyes, just like a human, but they cannot see.

(Baruch 6:9) 
They also have hands to feel, but they cannot touch. They have feet, but they cannot walk, because they are truly unable to move. Just like those who carry them, these idols are brought to shame.

(Baruch 6:10) 
For this reason, if they are thrown to the ground, they cannot rise by themselves. And if someone sets them upright, they cannot stand on their own. They are like dead things, such are the images placed upon them.

(Baruch 6:11) 
Furthermore, their priests steal the gold, silver, and garments that adorn the idols from under their temple roofs. They use these items for themselves and for prostitutes.

(Baruch 6:12) 
They dress the idols in gold and silver garments, adorning them as if they were people. Yet they do not allow these garments to remain with the idols permanently.

(Baruch 6:13) 
Indeed, the garments are better than the idols themselves, for the garments can suffer no harm in the way a living thing might. The priests actually use these very garments for their own needs.

(Baruch 6:14) 
Idols are implicated in theft, robbery, and among prostitutes. Indeed, the temple prostitutes gather women around them, sitting by the roadside, and burning incense themselves.

(Baruch 6:15) 
But if anyone among the worshippers is brought into the presence of someone who performs such deeds of idolatry, that person will argue directly that these idols belong to their gods.

(Baruch 6:16) 
For even their priests in their temples have their knees and heads shaved from behind, and they are stripped bare.

(Baruch 6:17) 
They shout loudly, like people at a feast, demonstrating their connection to these temples.

(Baruch 6:18) 
The moon, the sun, and the stars do not believe in these idols, though they themselves are shining and useful. But the idols are vain, useless, and without a voice.

(Baruch 6:19) 
They are made of wood, and from that same wood, for ornamentation, they are overlaid with brass, bronze, iron, lead, and clay.

(Baruch 6:20) 
Yet they cannot be saved from moths and rust.

(Baruch 6:21) 
They are covered with purple and blue garments, as if to be cleansed. Because they are not gods, they will be mocked.

(Baruch 6:22) 
Therefore, in every way, the righteous person who has no idols is better, for he will be without reproach.

(Baruch 6:23) 
Indeed, they are skillfully crafted from wood, and they are clothed with silver, gold, purple, blue, and fine linen.

(Baruch 6:24) 
Yet they will not be free from rust, moths, and decay. The materials they are made from are better than the idols themselves. But the idols cannot save themselves.

(Baruch 6:25) 
And the man who makes them, if he becomes ill, is as helpless as a dead man.

(Baruch 6:26) 
For just as in a house, so also in their temples there is theft, falsehood, ropes, and snares. This is why it is better to be righteous and to have no idols, for such people will be free from reproach.

(Baruch 6:27) 
And some among them have perished because of their own deeds. How then can anyone consider or think that these are gods?

(Baruch 6:28) 
Indeed, the Chaldeans themselves honor these idols. When they see a mute person who cannot speak, they offer him to Bel, asking that he might speak, as if the idol could actually perceive or understand.

(Baruch 6:29) 
Yet these idols cannot see. And those who worship them, despite despising them, still leave them. Even when they know these things, they cannot abandon the idols because they themselves lack understanding.

(Baruch 6:30) 
Women, adorned with ropes, sit in the roads, burning straw incense. If one of them is approached by a passerby and lies with him, the others will mock her for not being considered worthy like themselves, and for her rope not being broken.

(Baruch 6:31) 
Everything that is done concerning these idols is false. How then can anyone estimate or think that they are gods?

(Baruch 6:32) 
They are made by carpenters and goldsmiths. They cannot come into existence except by the skill of these craftsmen.

(Baruch 6:33) 
And the idols themselves have no means to repair themselves as they age.

(Baruch 6:34) 
For they are carried around, and what can they do by themselves?

(Baruch 6:35) 
But if someone cannot walk with steady feet, he must be carried by another, since he cannot move on his own. The idols are no more straight or self-moving than carved wood.

(Baruch 6:36) 
And these idols, adorned with gold, silver, stone, and cloaks, are like little children who have no strength. They cannot save themselves from robbers.

(Baruch 6:37) 
From a wall, or wood, or stones, robbers can take the gold, silver, and garments that are upon these idols, and then they leave with their plunder.

(Baruch 6:38) 
Thus, it is better to give to the poor, from whom nothing is stolen, than to these idols. They possess no power to benefit themselves or others.

(Baruch 6:39) 
Clothed with wood, cloth, and lime, they cannot save themselves from moths, rust, or dust.

(Baruch 6:40) 
Furthermore, when there is smoke in their temple, it settles on their faces, darkening them.

(Baruch 6:41) 
Their eyes are like those of humans; they are made of bronze, yet they do not look upon anything.

(Baruch 6:42) 
Their priests steal from their own gods and lock them up at night. They do not light lamps for them, lest they reveal the thefts that occur in the temple. They even stretch ropes over the idols to secure them.

(Baruch 6:43) 
But when they do light them, they forcefully make these gods shine with light, yet the idols do not see. How then can anyone consider or think that they are gods?

(Baruch 6:44) 
Indeed, when they have received anything from someone, the priests themselves, even in their own homes, steal the gold, silver, and garments from the idols. They then use these items to dress their wives and children.

(Baruch 6:45) 
Or if some evil befalls them from anyone, it is better for them to deal with a powerful king or a tyrant than with these idols.

(Baruch 6:46) 
By this, it is certainly clear that they are not gods, for they cannot save a person from death, nor are they strong enough to protect from insults.

(Baruch 6:47) 
They do not restore sight to the blind, nor do they free anyone from prison, nor do they raise the dead.

(Baruch 6:48) 
They do not relieve the afflicted, nor do they cause kings to act with kindness. They do not grant sons or daughters.

(Baruch 6:49) 
Men, women, and children sacrifice to them. How then can anyone consider or think that these are gods?

(Baruch 6:50) 
They do not deliver anyone from war, nor from misfortunes. They do not deliver from Egypt, nor from the Greeks.

(Baruch 6:51) 
But even when they are sealed with wood, gold, and silver, and clothed with cloaks, it is clear that they are not gods.

(Baruch 6:52) 
And they show every nation and king that they are not gods, but merely works of human hands, and they have no power within themselves.

(Baruch 6:53) 
Who then can make it clear that they are not gods, and that they are not beyond reproach?

(Baruch 6:54) 
They do not appoint a king, nor do they become like true gods. Who then will stand up for them? Or when one judges them, they are found to be not good.

(Baruch 6:55) 
They cannot save themselves from water, from rain, or from sweat. They do not save themselves from the damage to the wood and the lime that forms them. Even their silver and gold faces, when they exist, are subject to rust and decay.

(Baruch 6:56) 
Worshippers light many lamps for them, as if the idols were incapable of seeing on their own.

(Baruch 6:57) 
They are adorned with wood, gold, silver, and stones. The things they do with water, and in their temples, are meaningless.

(Baruch 6:58) 
Better is the righteous person who has no idols, because he has cast these things far away.

(Baruch 6:59) 
Indeed, they cannot preserve themselves from the wind, the air, or the storm. They will not save from the tempest, nor from the wind.

(Baruch 6:60) 
They cannot protect from fire, whether in summer or winter, nor from a storm.

(Baruch 6:61) 
Through this, it is evident that they are not gods, because they cannot save themselves, nor deliver themselves from fire, nor from bronze (their material), nor from a storm.

(Baruch 6:62) 
And they are clothed with wood, and gold, and silver, and cloth, just like wooden items in houses. They are themselves works of human hands, and they have no power within themselves.

(Baruch 6:63) 
Because by this it is manifest that they are not gods. For they do not preserve themselves from moths, nor from rust, nor from dust.

(Baruch 6:64) 
And concerning winds, and rains, and waters, and human actions: those who cannot be saved from the very things by which wood, and stones, and gold, and silver are made—these are not gods.

(Baruch 6:65) 
It will therefore be manifest in all things: that in all respects, they are not gods.

(Baruch 6:66) 
Therefore, do not fear them.

(Baruch 6:67) 
For just as a broken pot is useless, so too are their idols that are in houses, they are dishonorable.

(Baruch 6:68) 
They have eyes, and ears, and heads, and feet,

(Baruch 6:69) 
But those who use them are the ones who truly see or hear. The idols themselves have no such faculties.
