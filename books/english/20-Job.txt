(Job 1:1) 
There was a man in the land of Uz named Job. That man was innocent in his heart, righteous in his deeds, reverent toward God, and always turned away from evil.

(Job 1:2) 
To him were born seven sons and three daughters.

(Job 1:3) 
His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yokes of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys. He also had a very numerous household of servants. That man was the greatest of all the people of the East.

(Job 1:4) 
His sons would go and hold feasts in their own houses, each on his designated day. They would send for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

(Job 1:5) 
When the cycle of feasting days had passed, Job would send for his children and purify them. Rising early in the morning, he would offer a burnt offering for each of them. He would say to himself, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and inwardly renounced God in their hearts." Job did this continually.

(Job 1:6) 
Now on a certain day, when the sons of God — the angelic beings — came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also came among them.

(Job 1:7) 
The Lord said to him, "Where have you come from?" And Satan answered, "I have traveled throughout the earth, walking to and fro across it."

(Job 1:8) 
The Lord then said to him, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a man innocent in his heart and righteous in his deeds, reverent toward God, and always turning away from evil."

(Job 1:9) 
Satan answered the Lord, "Does Job fear God for nothing? Is there no gain for him in it?"

(Job 1:10) 
"Have You not hedged him in —protected him — and his house, and all his possessions on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his wealth has increased on the earth.

(Job 1:11) 
But stretch out Your hand a little and touch all that he possesses, and see if he will not curse You to Your face."

(Job 1:12) 
Then the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only do not lay a hand on him personally." So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.

(Job 1:13) 
Now on a certain day, when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,

(Job 1:14) 
a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were grazing beside them,

(Job 1:15) 
when the Sabeans raided, took them all, and killed the servants with the sword. I alone have escaped to tell you."

(Job 1:16) 
While he was still speaking, behold, another messenger came and said, "Fire from the sky —sent by God— fell and burned up the sheep, and consumed the servants. I alone have escaped to tell you."

(Job 1:17) 
While he was still speaking, another entered and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties, attacked the camels, and took them. They also killed the servants with the sword. I alone have escaped to tell you."

(Job 1:18) 
While he was still speaking, behold, another messenger came in and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother.

(Job 1:19) 
Then suddenly a violent wind burst in from the desert, struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed, crushing your children, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."

(Job 1:20) 
Then Job arose, tore his clothes as a sign of mourning, shaved his head, and falling to the ground, he worshipped.

(Job 1:21) 
He said, "I came out naked from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there, to the earth. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. As it pleased the Lord, so it has happened. May the name of the Lord be blessed."

(Job 1:22) 
In all these things, Job did not sin with his lips, nor did he speak anything foolish against God.

(Job 2:1) 
Again, on a certain day, when God's holy angels came to serve before the Lord in His heavenly court, Satan also came among them, standing in the Lord's presence.

(Job 2:2) 
And the Lord said to Satan, "Where do you come from?" Satan answered, "I have been circling the earth, and I have walked throughout it."

(Job 2:3) 
And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you truly considered My servant Job, that there is no one like him on earth—a simple and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds onto his integrity, even though you provoked Me against him to afflict him without cause."

(Job 2:4) 
Satan answered Him, saying, "Skin for skin! A man will give everything he owns to save his own life."

(Job 2:5) 
"But stretch out Your hand a little bit and strike his bone and his flesh, and then You will see if he curses You to Your face."

(Job 2:6) 
So the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power. However, you must spare his life."

(Job 2:7) 
So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with painful boils and festering sores, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

(Job 2:8) 
Job sat among the ashes and used a broken piece of pottery to scrape his sores.

(Job 2:9) 
And his wife said to him, "Are you still clinging to your integrity? Bless God and die!"

(Job 2:10) 
But Job said to her, "You are speaking like one of the foolish women. If we accept good things from the hand of God, why should we not also accept difficult things?" In all these trials, Job did not sin with his lips.

(Job 2:11) 
Now, when Job's three friends heard about all the evil that had come upon him, they came, each from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They had agreed to come together to visit him and to console him.

(Job 2:12) 
And when they lifted their eyes from a distance, they did not recognize him because of his disfigurement. They cried out and wept, tearing their garments, and they sprinkled dust over their heads toward the sky as a sign of their deep grief.

(Job 2:13) 
And they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very intense.

(Job 2:14) 
After all this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.

(Job 2:15) 
And he spoke these words:

(Job 2:16) 
"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night in which it was announced: 'A man has been conceived!'"

(Job 2:17) 
"Let that day turn into darkness. Let God above not seek it out, and let no light illuminate it."

(Job 2:18) 
"Let deep darkness and the shadow of death obscure that day. Let a thick cloud settle upon it, and let it be enveloped in bitterness."

(Job 2:19) 
"Let a dark storm seize that night. Let it not be counted among the days of the year, nor included in the number of the months."

(Job 2:20) 
"Let that night be solitary and not worthy of praise among the number of the months."

(Job 2:21) 
"Let those who curse the day curse it—those sorcerers who are ready to rouse Leviathan."

(Job 2:22) 
"Let its stars be darkened by its gloom. Let it wait for light but not see it, nor the rising of the dawn."

(Job 2:23) 
"Because it did not close the doors of the womb from which I came, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes."

(Job 2:24) 
"Why did I not die in the womb? Why did I not perish as soon as I came out of the belly?"

(Job 2:25) 
"Why was I received upon knees? Why was I nursed at breasts?"

(Job 2:26) 
"For now, I would lie down and be silent. I would sleep and be at peace, restored by rest."

(Job 2:27) 
"With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places and monuments for themselves."

(Job 2:28) 
"Or with princes who possessed gold and filled their houses with silver."

(Job 2:29) 
"Or like a hidden, stillborn child, I would not exist; or like those who were conceived but never saw the light of day."

(Job 2:30) 
"There, in that place of rest, the wicked cease from their raging, and those who were exhausted in strength find peace."

(Job 2:31) 
"And those who were once bound together, without any trouble, no longer hear the voice of the oppressor."

(Job 2:32) 
"The small and the great are there alike, and the slave is free from his master."

(Job 2:33) 
"Why is light given to the miserable, and life to those who are bitter in spirit?"

(Job 2:34) 
"Who long for death, but it does not come, and they search for it more eagerly than for hidden treasures."

(Job 2:35) 
"They rejoice greatly when they find the grave."

(Job 2:36) 
"Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, and whom God has surrounded with darkness?"

(Job 2:37) 
"Before I eat, I sigh, and my groans pour out like flowing waters."

(Job 2:38) 
"For the very fear that I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened."

(Job 2:39) 
"I did not pretend to be calm, nor was I silent, nor did I find rest; yet, anger and suffering still came upon me."

(Job 2:40) 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:

(Job 3:1) 
After everything that had happened, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.

(Job 3:2) 
Then Job spoke, and said:

(Job 3:3) 
Let the day I was born completely vanish. And let the night also vanish when it was announced: 'A man has been conceived!'

(Job 3:4) 
May that day turn into total darkness. May God above not look upon it or care about it, and may it never be brightened by any light.

(Job 3:5) 
Let shadows and the deepest gloom of death obscure it. Let thick fog and bitterness completely overwhelm it.

(Job 3:6) 
Let a dark storm claim that night as its own. May it not be counted among the days of the year, nor included in the months.

(Job 3:7) 
May that night be utterly desolate and solitary. May it never be a night for rejoicing or praise.

(Job 3:8) 
Let those who curse days, those who are ready to rouse the great sea monster Leviathan, curse that night.

(Job 3:9) 
Let its morning stars be obscured by its gloom. May it long for light but never see it, nor the dawning of the rising sun.

(Job 3:10) 
Because that night did not seal the doors of the womb that carried me, nor did it keep sorrow and misfortune from my eyes.

(Job 3:11) 
Why was I not stillborn in the womb? Why did I not perish immediately upon leaving my mother's body?

(Job 3:12) 
Why was I received upon knees? Why was I nursed at the breast?

(Job 3:13) 
For now, I would be lying in silent sleep. I would be refreshed by slumber, and I would be at peace.

(Job 3:14) 
I would be at rest with kings and the great leaders of the earth, who built desolate ruins for themselves as tombs.

(Job 3:15) 
Or with princes who possessed gold and filled their houses with silver, all now in their tombs.

(Job 3:16) 
Or, like a hidden miscarriage, I would not even exist. I would be like infants who were conceived but never saw the light of day.

(Job 3:17) 
In the grave, the wicked cease from their raging tumult, and those who are exhausted from their strength finally rest.

(Job 3:18) 
There, even prisoners who were once bound lie together without any trouble. They do not hear the voice of their taskmaster anymore.

(Job 3:19) 
Both the insignificant and the powerful are there, and the servant is finally free from his master.

(Job 3:20) 
Why is light given to the miserable? And why is life given to those who live in such bitterness of soul?

(Job 3:21) 
They long for death, but it does not come. They search for it more eagerly than for hidden treasures.

(Job 3:22) 
They rejoice exceedingly when they finally find the grave.

(Job 3:23) 
Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, a man whom God has surrounded with darkness and despair?

(Job 3:24) 
Before I eat, I sigh; and my groans pour out like overflowing waters.

(Job 3:25) 
For the very terror I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened.

(Job 3:26) 
I have not found peace, nor quiet, nor rest. Instead, only torment and anger have come upon me.

(Job 4:1) 
But Eliphaz, the man from Teman, spoke, responding to what Job had said:

(Job 4:2) 
If we were to begin speaking to you, perhaps you would take it badly. But who can possibly hold back the words that have formed in his mind?

(Job 4:3) 
Look, you yourself have instructed many people, and you have given strength to those whose hands were weak.

(Job 4:4) 
Your words have stabilized those who were wavering, and you have strengthened trembling knees.

(Job 4:5) 
But now a calamity has come upon you, and you have become weak. It has touched you, and you are deeply troubled.

(Job 4:6) 
Was not your reverence for God your confidence? And your hope, the blamelessness of your ways?

(Job 4:7) 
Please remember this: Has any innocent person ever perished? Or when have the upright ever been destroyed?

(Job 4:8) 
On the contrary, I have seen that those who practice wickedness, and sow seeds of trouble, eventually reap those same troubles.

(Job 4:9) 
They perish by the very breath of God, and they are consumed by the spirit of His anger.

(Job 4:10) 
The roaring of the lion, and the cry of the lioness, and the teeth of the young lions, are all broken.

(Job 4:11) 
The tiger perishes because it has no prey, and the young lions are scattered.

(Job 4:12) 
Moreover, a word was secretly revealed to me, and my ear caught its whisper as if by stealth.

(Job 4:13) 
In the terror of a vision by night, when deep sleep usually overtakes people,

(Job 4:14) 
fear and trembling seized me, and all my bones were terrified.

(Job 4:15) 
And when a spirit passed right before me, the hairs of my body stood on end.

(Job 4:16) 
Someone stood there, whose face I could not recognize; only an outline was before my eyes, and then I heard a voice like a soft whisper.

(Job 4:17) 
Can a mortal man be considered righteous in comparison with God? Or can a man be pure before his Maker?

(Job 4:18) 
Look, those who serve Him are not steadfast, and He finds fault even in His Angels.

(Job 4:19) 
How much more, then, will those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the earth, be consumed like a moth?

(Job 4:20) 
From morning until evening, they are cut down. And because no one understands their plight, they perish forever.

(Job 4:21) 
Those who lived with them are utterly cut off from their very being; they die, and not in wisdom.

(Job 4:22) 
Cry out, if there is anyone who will answer you! And turn to any of the holy ones for help.

(Job 4:23) 
Truly, wrath slays the foolish, and resentment kills a man.

(Job 4:24) 
I myself have seen a foolish man taking root, but immediately I cursed his prosperity.

(Job 4:25) 
May his home be without children, and may his children be plundered.

(Job 4:26) 
May his children suckle on poverty, and may they be driven out of their homes.

(Job 4:27) 
May hunger mock his riches, and may an armed man drag him away.

(Job 4:28) 
May his own small field not yield its fruit, and may the thirsty consume his possessions.

(Job 4:29) 
Indeed, wickedness does not spring up from the earth, and sorrow does not grow out of the ground.

(Job 4:30) 
Man is born for labor, just as a bird is born for flight.

(Job 4:31) 
For this reason, I will call upon the Lord, and I will present my case to God.

(Job 4:32) 
He is the One who does great and unsearchable things, and wonders beyond counting.

(Job 4:33) 
He is the One who sends rain upon the face of the earth, and waters all living things with moisture.

(Job 4:34) 
He is the One who sets the humble on high, and lifts up those who mourn into security and wellbeing.

(Job 4:35) 
He is the One who thwarts the schemes of the malicious, so that they cannot achieve their full intent.

(Job 4:36) 
He is the One who catches the cunning in their own craftiness, and scatters the plans of the perverse.

(Job 4:37) 
They grope about in daylight, yet there is no light for them; they stumble at noon as if in the deepest night.

(Job 4:38) 
He saves the poor from the sharp words of their mouths, and from the hand of the violent man.

(Job 4:39) 
And so there will be hope for the poor, and wickedness will be silenced.

(Job 4:40) 
Blessed is the man whom God corrects. Therefore, do not reject the rebuke of the Most High.

(Job 5:1) 
Go ahead and call out, if there is anyone at all who will answer your pleas, or if any of the holy ones—be they angels or righteous men—will agree with you.

(Job 5:2) 
Truly, uncontrolled anger destroys the foolish man, and envy is deadly to the simple-minded.

(Job 5:3) 
I have seen a foolish man firmly established, and I immediately pronounced a curse upon his home.

(Job 5:4) 
His children will be far from any help or safety, and they will be crushed in the city gate—the place of judgment—with no one to rescue them.

(Job 5:5) 
The hungry will eat his harvest, even snatching it from among thorns, and the thirsty will consume all his wealth.

(Job 5:6) 
Nothing happens on earth without a reason, and pain does not simply arise from the ground without a cause, as if it were a plant.

(Job 5:7) 
For man is born to toil, just as a bird is born to fly.

(Job 5:8) 
Because of this truth, I will appeal to the Lord, and I will present my case before God.

(Job 5:9) 
He is the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders beyond all counting.

(Job 5:10) 
He is the One who sends rain upon the face of the land and waters all things with refreshing water.

(Job 5:11) 
He is the One who sets the humble in high places, and raises those who mourn to a state of security and well-being.

(Job 5:12) 
He is the One who frustrates the plans of malicious men, so that they cannot achieve their desires or speak boastfully of their success.

(Job 5:13) 
He is the One who traps the cunning in their own craftiness, and He brings to nothing the plans of the twisted-minded.

(Job 5:14) 
During the day, they will encounter darkness, and even at high noon, they will grope about as if it were the dead of night.

(Job 5:15) 
But He will save the poor from the grasp of death, and He will deliver the needy from the hand of the violent oppressor.

(Job 5:16) 
And so there will be hope for the poor, while injustice will be silenced.

(Job 5:17) 
Blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore, do not despise the discipline of the Most High God.

(Job 5:18) 
For He Himself inflicts the wound, and then He heals it; He strikes, and His hands alone bring restoration.

(Job 5:19) 
Through six troubles, He will deliver you, and in the seventh, no evil will even touch you.

(Job 5:20) 
In times of famine, He will deliver you from death itself, and in war, He will save you from the power of the sword.

(Job 5:21) 
You will be hidden from the scourge of slanderous tongues, and you will not fear devastation when it arrives.

(Job 5:22) 
You will laugh at devastation and famine, and you will not dread the wild beasts of the land.

(Job 5:23) 
For you will have a covenant relationship even with the stones of the field, and the wild animals of the earth will be at peace with you.

(Job 5:24) 
And you will know that peace resides in your dwelling place, and when you inspect your flock, you will find nothing missing or amiss.

(Job 5:25) 
And you will know that your descendants will be numerous, and your offspring like the abundant grass of the earth.

(Job 5:26) 
You will come to your grave in ripe old age, just as a shock of grain is gathered in its proper season.

(Job 5:27) 
Behold, this is what we have diligently researched, and it is truly so: what you have heard, write it down and keep it for yourself.

(Job 6:1) 
But Job responded and said:

(Job 6:2) 
Oh, if only my wrongdoing could be weighed on a scale, that wrongdoing for which I have deserved God’s wrath, and if only the suffering I am enduring could be weighed alongside it!

(Job 6:3) 
My suffering would appear heavier than the sand of the sea: that is why my words are full of pain.

(Job 6:4) 
For the arrows of the Lord are within me, and His indignation has consumed my spirit, and the terrors sent by the Lord wage war against me.

(Job 6:5) 
Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass? Or does the ox bellow when it stands before a full manger?

(Job 6:6) 
Can something tasteless be eaten, something not seasoned with salt? Can a bitter thing be swallowed without disgust, once it has been tasted?

(Job 6:7) 
Things which my soul previously refused to touch, now I am forced to eat because of my distress.

(Job 6:8) 
Who will grant that my request might come to me, and that God might grant me what I await?

(Job 6:9) 
And that God might begin to crush me, that He might release His hand and cut me off?

(Job 6:10) 
And let this be my consolation: that in afflicting me with pain, He may not spare me, nor will I contradict the words of the Holy One.

(Job 6:11) 
For what strength do I have to endure this? Or what end do I have to act with patience?

(Job 6:12) 
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?

(Job 6:13) 
Truly, there is no help for me within myself, and even my capability has departed from me.

(Job 6:14) 
He who withholds mercy from his friend abandons the fear of the Lord.

(Job 6:15) 
My brothers have deceived me like a wadi, a seasonal stream that flows through valleys.

(Job 6:16) 
They swell with dark waters from the melting snow, where snow is hidden within them.

(Job 6:17) 
In the time when they disperse their waters, they dry up, and when the heat comes, they vanish from their place.

(Job 6:18) 
Their paths twist into crooked ways, they turn off into nothingness, and they perish.

(Job 6:19) 
The caravans from Tema looked for their paths, and the travelers from Sheba waited expectantly for water.

(Job 6:20) 
They were confused and ashamed because they had hoped; they came to the wadi’s location and were covered with disappointment.

(Job 6:21) 
Now you have become nothing to me; seeing my affliction, you are terrified.

(Job 6:22) 
Have I ever said: 'Bring something to me, and endow me from your possessions?'

(Job 6:23) 
Or: 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemy, and redeem me from the hand of the powerful?'

(Job 6:24) 
Teach me, and I will be silent; and if by chance I have been ignorant of anything, instruct me.

(Job 6:25) 
Why have you undermined the words of truth, when among you there is no one who can argue a point effectively?

(Job 6:26) 
Do you only prepare speeches for rebuking, and do you utter words into the wind?

(Job 6:27) 
You even attack an orphan, and you overthrow your friend.

(Job 6:28) 
Turn back, and consider; I will see if I lie.

(Job 6:29) 
At least respond, lest there be iniquity; and acknowledge what is just when you speak.

(Job 6:30) 
Is there iniquity on my tongue? Or can it not be discerned if there is harshness in my understanding?

(Job 7:1) 
Is not the life of man on earth a perpetual struggle, like a soldier's deployment? And are not his days exactly like the days of a hired worker, who anxiously waits for the end of his shift and his payment?

(Job 7:2) 
Just as a slave desires the shade from the scorching sun, and just as a hired hand longs for the completion of his work,

(Job 7:3) 
So too have I endured empty months without relief, and I have counted for myself many nights of painful labor and suffering.

(Job 7:4) 
If I try to sleep, I ask myself, 'When will I rise again?' And then I anxiously await the evening, only to be filled with even more sorrows.

(Job 7:5) 
My flesh is covered with putrefaction and with filthy dust, as my skin becomes dry and wastes away.

(Job 7:6) 
My days have passed more swiftly than a weaver’s shuttle is cut from the loom, and they are consumed without any hope for betterment.

(Job 7:7) 
Remember, O God, that my life is but a fleeting breath of wind, and my eyes will never return to see any good thing.

(Job 7:8) 
Nor will the gaze of any human see me again. Your eyes will search for me, but I will no longer exist.

(Job 7:9) 
Just as a cloud is consumed and passes away, so too will he who descends to the underworld never ascend back to this life.

(Job 7:10) 
He will not return again to his own house, nor will his place on earth know him any longer.

(Job 7:11) 
Therefore, I will not hold back my words. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will pour out my bitterness of soul.

(Job 7:12) 
Am I the tumultuous sea, or a monstrous sea creature, that You should confine me with such a barrier and restrain me?

(Job 7:13) 
If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, I will find relief speaking to myself on my couch and finding peace there,'

(Job 7:14) 
You, O God, terrorize me through dreams, and You shake me with horror through terrifying visions.

(Job 7:15) 
Because of this, my soul has chosen strangulation, and death rather than to continue living in such torment.

(Job 7:16) 
I have despaired, and I no longer wish to live. Leave me alone, for my days are nothing of value.

(Job 7:17) 
What is man, that You should magnify him with such attention? Or why do You set Your heart upon him with such scrutiny?

(Job 7:18) 
You visit him every morning, and You test him suddenly, without warning?

(Job 7:19) 
How long will You not spare me, nor leave me alone long enough to even swallow my saliva and catch my breath?

(Job 7:20) 
I have sinned; what can I do to You, O Guardian of men? Why have You made me Your target, and why have I become a burden to myself?

(Job 7:21) 
Why do You not take away my sin? And why do You not remove my iniquity? For behold, now I will sleep in the dust, and if You search for me in the morning, I will no longer be there.

(Job 8:1) 
And then Bildad the Shuhite replied and said:

(Job 8:2) 
How long will you speak such things? The words coming from your mouth are like a strong, destructive whirlwind, like a storm!

(Job 8:3) 
Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty ever twist what is right?

(Job 8:4) 
If your sons sinned against Him, then He surely delivered them over to the consequences of their sin.

(Job 8:5) 
But if you would sincerely seek God early in the morning, and implore the Almighty for mercy:

(Job 8:6) 
if you are pure and upright, then He would immediately awaken to your plight, and restore the peaceful dwelling of your righteousness.

(Job 8:7) 
And even if your beginnings were humble, in the end, your prosperity will be greatly multiplied.

(Job 8:8) 
For inquire of the generations of old, and diligently examine the wisdom passed down by the fathers:

(Job 8:9) 
For we are only of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are like a passing shadow.

(Job 8:10) 
Will they not themselves teach you, and speak to you their wisdom? And from their hearts bring forth wise sayings?

(Job 8:11) 
Can papyrus grow tall without water? Or can reeds flourish without marshy ground?

(Job 8:12) 
Even while still in its bloom, before it can dry out—before any plant can be cut—it withers away sooner than all other plants.

(Job 8:13) 
Such is the fate of all who forget God, and the hope of the godless will perish.

(Job 8:14) 
Whose confidence is like a fragile net, and whose trust is like a spider's web.

(Job 8:15) 
He leans on his house, but it will not stand; he props it up, but it will not hold firm.

(Job 8:16) 
He seems fresh and green before the sun comes, and his branches sprout vigorously in his garden;

(Job 8:17) 
his roots spread out over a heap of stones, and entwine themselves among the rocks.

(Job 8:18) 
If he is uprooted from his place, then the place itself will deny him, saying, 'I do not know you!'

(Job 8:19) 
Behold, such is the fleeting joy of his existence; and from his very ground, another will arise.

(Job 8:20) 
For God will not reject a blameless person, nor will He uphold the hand of evildoers.

(Job 8:21) 
Until He fills your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouts of joy.

(Job 8:22) 
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the impious will cease to exist.

(Job 9:1) 
Job then answered and said:

(Job 9:2) 
Truly, I know that this is the truth—no mortal man can be justified when compared to God.

(Job 9:3) 
If God wishes to argue against a man, the man will not be able to answer even one in a thousand points God raises.

(Job 9:4) 
God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has ever resisted Him and found peace afterward?

(Job 9:5) 
He is the One who moves mountains, and those whom He overturns in His fury do not even perceive it happening.

(Job 9:6) 
He is the One who shakes the earth from its foundations, and its very pillars tremble.

(Job 9:7) 
He commands the sun, and it does not rise. He seals up the stars as if they are under His control.

(Job 9:8) 
He alone spreads out the universe, and He walks upon the waves of the sea.

(Job 9:9) 
He made the constellations Arcturus, Orion, and the Hyades, and also the hidden southern constellations.

(Job 9:10) 
He performs great deeds that cannot be understood, and wonders that are beyond counting.

(Job 9:11) 
If He comes to me, I will not see Him. If He passes by, I will not comprehend it.

(Job 9:12) 
If He suddenly snatches something away, who can stop Him? Or who can say to Him: 'Why do You do this?'

(Job 9:13) 
God, whose wrath no one can resist, is the One before whom even the cosmic powers that hold up the world bend.

(Job 9:14) 
How then can I be great enough to answer Him, or to speak my own words in debate with Him?

(Job 9:15) 
Even if I possessed some righteousness, I would not answer Him. Instead, I would implore my Judge for mercy.

(Job 9:16) 
And even if I were to call upon Him and He heard me, I would not believe that He was actually speaking to me.

(Job 9:17) 
For He would crush me with a storm, and multiply my wounds without any discernible cause.

(Job 9:18) 
He does not allow my spirit to rest, but fills me with bitter experiences.

(Job 9:19) 
If strength is sought, He is the mightiest. If justice is sought, no one dares to speak on my behalf.

(Job 9:20) 
If I wanted to justify myself, my own mouth would condemn me. If I showed myself innocent, it would prove me perverse.

(Job 9:21) 
Even if I were perfectly blameless, my soul would not recognize this, and I would be overwhelmed with sorrow.

(Job 9:22) 
There is one truth that I have spoken: God consumes both the innocent and the wicked.

(Job 9:23) 
If a sudden scourge brings death, He mocks the suffering of the innocent.

(Job 9:24) 
The earth is given into the hands of the wicked. God conceals the faces of its judges. If it is not God who does this, then who is it?

(Job 9:25) 
My days have been swifter than a swift messenger; they have fled away without seeing any good.

(Job 9:26) 
They have passed away like swiftly loaded ships with goods, and like an eagle flying towards its prey.

(Job 9:27) 
If I say: 'I will forget my complaint, I will ignore my roaring, and I will put on a cheerful expression,'

(Job 9:28) 
I still fear all my sorrows, knowing that You will not spare the guilty.

(Job 9:29) 
But if I am, even so, deemed wicked, why then have I labored in vain?

(Job 9:30) 
If I were to wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands until they were as pure as possible,

(Job 9:31) 
even then, You would plunge me into filth, and my own clothes would detest me.

(Job 9:32) 
For I do not contend with God in a trial, as I would with a mere man who is like me; for He is not a man like me, that I could equally argue with Him.

(Job 9:33) 
There is no arbiter who can reprove both of us, and lay his hand between us to mediate.

(Job 9:34) 
Let Him remove His rod of chastisement from me, and let His terror not frighten me.

(Job 9:35) 
Then I would speak and not be afraid of Him, for in my current state, I cannot be free from fear.

(Job 10:1) 
My very being finds my life unbearable. I will unleash my complaint, even if it sounds like it’s against myself. I will speak from the deepest bitterness within my spirit.

(Job 10:2) 
I will say to God: 'Please, do not condemn me. Show me the reason why You judge me in this way.'

(Job 10:3) 
Does it seem right to You that You should oppress me, Your own creation, and then seem to favor the schemes of the wicked?

(Job 10:4) 
Do You have the limited vision of mortal eyes? Do You see things the way a mere human sees them?

(Job 10:5) 
Are Your days as fleeting as the days of a man? Are Your years as limited as human life spans?

(Job 10:6) 
Why do You meticulously search for my guilt and scrutinize my every sin, as if You didn't already know everything?

(Job 10:7) 
Even though You know I haven't committed any grave sin against You, there is no one who can rescue me from Your mighty hand.

(Job 10:8) 
Your hands created me and fashioned every part of me. How can You so suddenly decide to destroy me?

(Job 10:9) 
Please remember that You molded me from clay, and it is to dust that You will return me.

(Job 10:10) 
Did You not pour me out like milk and then solidify me like cheese, forming my body?

(Job 10:11) 
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and You knit me together with bones and sinews.

(Job 10:12) 
You granted me life and Your lovingkindness, and Your watchful care preserved my very breath.

(Job 10:13) 
Even if You have hidden purposes in Your heart regarding these matters, I still know that You remember all things—including my actions.

(Job 10:14) 
If I have sinned, You know it instantly, and You do not allow me to be declared innocent of my wrongdoing.

(Job 10:15) 
If I were truly wicked, then woe to me! But even if I am innocent, I cannot hold my head high, for I am utterly saturated with suffering and misery.

(Job 10:16) 
If I show any pride, You hunt me down like a fierce lion, and again and again, You return to inflict extraordinary pain upon me.

(Job 10:17) 
You bring fresh evidence against me, and You intensify Your anger towards me, crushing me with wave after wave of pain.

(Job 10:18) 
Why did You bring me forth from my mother’s womb? If only I had died at birth, so that no one would have ever seen me.

(Job 10:19) 
Then I would have been as if I had never existed, carried directly from the womb to the grave.

(Job 10:20) 
Since my few remaining days will soon be over, please leave me alone for a little while, so I can lament my pain.

(Job 10:21) 
Grant me this before I journey to the place of no return—the dark land, shrouded in the deepest gloom of death.

(Job 10:22) 
It is a land of utter misery and darkness, where the shadow of death is present everywhere, and there is no order, but only an everlasting terror.

(Job 11:1) 
Then Zophar, who was from Naamah and was one of Job's friends, replied to him, saying:

(Job 11:2) 
Will a man who multiplies words not be heard? Or will a talkative man be justified simply by speaking much?

(Job 11:3) 
Should men be silent before you and laugh with scorn? And when another mocks you, should no one correct him or put him to shame?

(Job 11:4) 
For you have said, 'My doctrine and my speech are pure, and I am clean in your sight.'

(Job 11:5) 
Oh, if only God would speak to you Himself and open His divine lips to address you directly,

(Job 11:6) 
so that He might show you the hidden secrets of His divine wisdom and make known to you how manifold His divine law is. Then you would understand that God demands less punishment from you than your sins actually deserve.

(Job 11:7) 
Can you possibly comprehend the deep and hidden ways of God? Or can you perfectly understand the Almighty and His infinite wisdom?

(Job 11:8) 
God is higher than the created universe itself—what can you possibly do to reach Him? He is deeper than the underworld, the realm of the dead—how can you truly know Him?

(Job 11:9) 
His wisdom and reach are longer than the entire earth in its measure, and wider than the vast sea.

(Job 11:10) 
If He should overthrow things, or confine them, or restrict them—who then could possibly contradict Him or stand against His will?

(Job 11:11) 
For He Himself knows the vanity and emptiness of human beings, and when He sees their iniquity, He does not fail to notice it.

(Job 11:12) 
An empty and vain person proudly exalts himself, and like an untamed wild donkey, he thinks he was born free from all accountability.

(Job 11:13) 
But you, Job, should set your heart aright and truly stretch out your hands in supplication toward Him.

(Job 11:14) 
If you remove the iniquity that is actively in your hands—meaning your sinful deeds—and if injustice no longer dwells in your tent, your home and your life:

(Job 11:15) 
then you will lift up your head, free from the blemish of sin, and you will be firm and steady, and you will no longer fear.

(Job 11:16) 
You will also entirely forget your past miseries, and you will remember them only as rushing waters that have flowed away and are gone.

(Job 11:17) 
And your light will shine forth like the brilliance of noonday, and even when you think you are failing or have come to an end, you will rise again like the morning star.

(Job 11:18) 
And you will have confidence because hope has been set before you, and you will rest securely, deeply rooted and safe.

(Job 11:19) 
And you will rest peacefully, and there will be no one to frighten you. Many will come to entreat your favor and seek your guidance.

(Job 11:20) 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail and lose their sight, and all possibility of escape will perish from them. Their hope will be like the fleeting breath of life, utterly insubstantial and gone in an instant.

(Job 12:1) 
But Job replied to them and said:

(Job 12:2) 
Do you really think that you are the only human beings who possess wisdom? Do you think wisdom will die when you die?

(Job 12:3) 
However, I also have understanding, just like you all do. I am not inferior to you. For who among us is ignorant of these things that you know?

(Job 12:4) 
A man like me, who is ridiculed by his friend, will call upon God, and God will hear him. For even the straightforward righteousness of a just man is ridiculed by others.

(Job 12:5) 
A lamp, despised in the thoughts of the wealthy, is ready to be scorned by the feet of those who stumble — meaning a man in misfortune is easily kicked aside.

(Job 12:6) 
The tents of robbers are full of prosperity, and they boldly challenge God Himself, even though God is the one who has given everything into their hands.

(Job 12:7) 
Indeed, if you ask the beasts of burden, they will teach you. And the birds of the sky will show you the truth.

(Job 12:8) 
Speak to the earth, and it will teach you. And the fish of the sea will tell you.

(Job 12:9) 
Who among all these living things does not know that the hand of the Lord has made these things?

(Job 12:10) 
In the Lord's hand is the soul of every living creature, and the breath of all human flesh.

(Job 12:11) 
Does not the ear discern words? And do not the mouth and palate taste and approve food for themselves?

(Job 12:12) 
Wisdom is found among the aged, and prudence comes from long experience with many things.

(Job 12:13) 
With God alone is true wisdom and strength. He alone has counsel and understanding.

(Job 12:14) 
If He destroys, no one can rebuild. If He shuts a man in, no one can open his prison.

(Job 12:15) 
If He holds back the waters, everything will dry up. And if He releases them, they will overturn the earth.

(Job 12:16) 
With Him is strength and wisdom. He knows both the deceiver and the one who is deceived.

(Job 12:17) 
He leads counselors to a foolish end, and He brings judges into a state of bewilderment.

(Job 12:18) 
He loosens the belt of kings — stripping them of their authority — and binds their loins with a rope — making them prisoners.

(Job 12:19) 
He leads priests away as captives, and He overthrows the powerful nobles.

(Job 12:20) 
He changes the speech of those who speak truthfully, making them unable to speak, and He takes away the wisdom of the elders.

(Job 12:21) 
He pours contempt upon princes, and He raises up those who had been oppressed.

(Job 12:22) 
He reveals deep things from the darkness, and He brings the shadow of death into the light.

(Job 12:23) 
He makes nations grow in number, and then He destroys them. And those that were overthrown, He restores again.

(Job 12:24) 
He changes the heart of the leaders of the people of the earth, and He deceives them, so that they wander in vain through an untraveled wilderness.

(Job 12:25) 
They will grope about as if in darkness, and not in the light. And He makes them stumble and wander as if they were drunk.

(Job 13:2) 
I know these things just as well as you do. I am not inferior to any of you.

(Job 13:3) 
But I will speak directly to the Almighty One. I intend to bring a charge against Him.

(Job 13:4) 
But you are merely forgers of lies. You are ministers of perverse doctrines.

(Job 13:5) 
I wish you would just keep silent, so that you might be considered wise!

(Job 13:6) 
Therefore, hear my rebuke. Pay attention to the judgment coming from my lips.

(Job 13:7) 
Does God truly need your lies, so that you may speak deceitfully on His behalf?

(Job 13:8) 
Or is it more pleasing to Him that you speak falsely for Him?

(Job 13:9) 
Or will He bring you forward to examine you? Can God be mocked, just as a human can be mocked?

(Job 13:10) 
He Himself will rebuke you, because you render judgment in secret.

(Job 13:11) 
As soon as He reveals Himself to you, His terror will shake you.

(Job 13:12) 
Your memory will be compared to ashes, and your defense will be like a heap of mud.

(Job 13:13) 
Be silent for a little while, so that I may speak whatever my mind suggests to me.

(Job 13:14) 
Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth? Why do I carry my life in my hands, risking it all?

(Job 13:15) 
Even if He kills me, I will still hope in Him. Nevertheless, I will argue my case and my ways in His presence.

(Job 13:16) 
And He Himself will be my Savior, my deliverer. For indeed, no hypocrite will come into His presence.

(Job 13:17) 
Listen carefully to my discourse, and let your ears perceive my true meaning.

(Job 13:18) 
Look! My judgment, my defense, is prepared. I know that I will be found just.

(Job 13:19) 
Who is it that will contend with me in judgment? Let them come forward. What reason do I have to remain silent?

(Job 13:20) 
Only two things, please do not do to me, and then I will not hide from your presence.

(Job 13:21) 
Keep Your hand far from me, and let Your terrifying majesty not frighten me.

(Job 13:22) 
Propose what You wish, and I will answer. Or indeed, let me speak, and You respond to me.

(Job 13:23) 
How many iniquities and sins do I have? Show me my crimes and my offenses.

(Job 13:24) 
Why do You hide Your face? Why do You consider me to be Your enemy?

(Job 13:25) 
Against a leaf that is snatched away by the wind, do You display Your power? Do You pursue a dry stubble of straw?

(Job 13:26) 
For You write bitter accusations against me, and You consume me with the sins of my youth.

(Job 13:27) 
You have put my foot in stocks. You have watched all my paths, and You have considered the very tracks of my feet.

(Job 13:28) 
I, who am to be consumed as if by rot, and like a garment that is eaten by a moth.

(Job 14:1) 
Every man born from a woman lives for only a brief time. His life is filled with many troubles and sufferings.

(Job 14:2) 
He comes forth like a flower, blooming only to be crushed and wither away. His life flees like a quickly passing shadow, and he never remains in the same state—constantly changing, constantly moving towards death.

(Job 14:3) 
Do You, O God, consider it worthy to even look upon such a fleeting creature? Do You bring such a one into Your judgment with You?

(Job 14:4) 
Who can make a clean thing out of something conceived from unclean seed, from a fallen human lineage? Only You, O God, can do that.

(Job 14:5) 
The days of man are short. The number of his months are determined by You, O God. You have set his boundaries, and these cannot be surpassed or extended.

(Job 14:6) 
Turn away from him for a little while, so that he may find some rest, until his appointed day of death comes—a day he looks forward to, just as a hired laborer longs for the end of his day to receive his wages.

(Job 14:7) 
Even a tree has hope: if it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new branches will bud and grow.

(Job 14:8) 
Even if its root grows old in the earth, and its stump appears to die away into the dust,

(Job 14:9) 
Yet, at the mere scent of water, it will bud and spring to life again, producing new foliage as if it were a young sapling freshly planted.

(Job 14:10) 
But when a man dies, when his body is stripped of life and consumed, where, I ask, is he? There is no hope of his return to earthly life.

(Job 14:11) 
Just as the waters of the sea may recede, and a river, once full, becomes empty and dries up completely,

(Job 14:12) 
So it is with man: once he dies, he will not rise again from that sleep, not until the very universe itself is worn away. He will not awaken, nor will he rise from his slumber in this earthly existence.

(Job 14:13) 
Oh, that someone would grant me this: that You would hide me in Sheol, or keep me in some secret place until Your divine wrath has passed over. And that You would then appoint a time when You would remember me.

(Job 14:14) 
If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my current struggle and service, I wait and hope until my change comes—the end of this suffering.

(Job 14:15) 
Then You will call to me, and I will answer You. You will extend Your right hand to the work of Your own hands, to me, Your creation.

(Job 14:16) 
Indeed, You closely observe my every step. But in that time, You will be merciful to my sins.

(Job 14:17) 
You have sealed up my iniquities as if in a bag for safekeeping, yet You have also covered over and healed my offenses.

(Job 14:18) 
But as a mountain crumbling eventually vanishes, and a rock is dislodged and moved from its place,

(Job 14:19) 
Just as water wears down stones, and an overwhelming flood gradually consumes the land, in the same way, You destroy the hope of man.

(Job 14:20) 
You overcome him, and he passes away. You change his countenance in death, and You send him away from life.

(Job 14:21) 
Whether his sons become honored or remain unknown, he does not know it. He is unaware of the fate of his descendants.

(Job 14:22) 
However, his own flesh, while he lives, will feel pain, and his soul within him will mourn over its own suffering.

(Job 15:1) 
Eliphaz the Themanite then responded and said:

(Job 15:2) 
Can any wise man truly respond with words that are as empty as wind, and then fill his stomach with such emptiness?

(Job 15:3) 
Do you argue against him with empty words? You are not his equal, and you gain nothing with such speech.

(Job 15:4) 
Indeed, you have dissolved all reverence for God, and you have diminished the importance of prayer before God.

(Job 15:5) 
For your iniquity has filled your mouth, and your tongue plans out blasphemies.

(Job 15:6) 
Your own tongue condemns you, not I; your own lips speak against you.

(Job 15:7) 
Were you the first man ever born, and formed before the hills?

(Job 15:8) 
Have you heard the counsel of God, and do you keep all wisdom to yourself?

(Job 15:9) 
What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we are unaware of?

(Job 15:10) 
Both old men and those with ancient wisdom are among us, many much older than your father.

(Job 15:11) 
Is it such a great thing that God would console you? And does your ear gently hear the secret words from you?

(Job 15:12) 
Why is your heart so lifted up with pride, and why do you have such astonished eyes, as if you are provoking God to anger?

(Job 15:13) 
Why does your spirit swell against God, so that you utter such words from your mouth?

(Job 15:14) 
What is man, that he should be without sin, or that one born of a woman should be justified?

(Job 15:15) 
Behold, even the holy ones are not steadfast in His sight, and even the heavens are not pure in His presence.

(Job 15:16) 
How much more abominable and useless is man, who drinks iniquity as if it were water?

(Job 15:17) 
I will show you, listen to me: and what I have found through experience, I will tell you.

(Job 15:18) 
What wise men declare, and what their fathers have not hidden from them:

(Job 15:19) 
To whom alone the land was given, and no foreigner passed among them.

(Job 15:20) 
The wicked man is arrogant all his days, and the number of years of his tyranny is uncertain.

(Job 15:21) 
The sound of terror is always in his ears, and even when there is peace, his snares are always timid.

(Job 15:22) 
He does not believe that he will return from the darkness, and he always expects another sword from every side.

(Job 15:23) 
When he flees for bread, where is it prepared for him? He knows that darkness is ready for him in the day.

(Job 15:24) 
Trouble and anguish will terrify him, and will prevail against him, like a king preparing for battle.

(Job 15:25) 
For he has stretched out his hand against God, and has strengthened himself against the Almighty.

(Job 15:26) 
He ran against Him with a stiff neck, under the boss of his own neck's shield.

(Job 15:27) 
For you have indeed consumed his abundance, and his very substance.

(Job 15:28) 
You have covered your own face with your own fat, and you make your neck heavy with your own indulgence.

(Job 15:29) 
He will not become rich, nor will his substance endure, nor will he send forth his root into the earth.

(Job 15:30) 
He will not escape the darkness; the flame will wither his branches; and his spirit will be taken away by the breath of God.

(Job 15:31) 
Let him not trust in vain, having been led astray by error, believing that he might be redeemed by any price.

(Job 15:32) 
He will perish before his appointed days, and his branches will not flourish.

(Job 15:33) 
He will pluck off his unripe grape like a vine, and cast off his blossom like an olive tree.

(Job 15:34) 
For the assembly of the hypocrite is barren, and fire will devour the tents of those who take bribes.

(Job 15:35) 
He conceives sorrow, and gives birth to iniquity, and his womb prepares deceits.

(Job 16:1) 
Job, however, responded and said:

(Job 16:2) 
I have often heard such words as these. All of you are burdensome comforters.

(Job 16:3) 
Will these empty words never end? Or what has provoked you to speak like this?

(Job 16:4) 
I also could speak similar words, and if only your souls were in place of my soul!

(Job 16:5) 
I could also strengthen you with my words and shake my head at you in mock sympathy.

(Job 16:6) 
If I speak, my pain does not cease. And if I am silent, it does not leave me.

(Job 16:7) 
But now, my affliction has saddened me, and it has devastated my entire household.

(Job 16:8) 
My wrinkles are a witness, even a false witness, that accuses me. My adversary, standing up against me with lies, makes my face gaunt.

(Job 16:9) 
In His wrath, He has torn me apart and opposed me. He has gnashed His teeth at me. My enemy has looked upon me with terrible eyes.

(Job 16:10) 
They have opened their mouths wide against me. They have struck my cheek with reproaches. They have gathered together against me.

(Job 16:11) 
God has shut me up among the wicked and has handed me over into the hands of the impious.

(Job 16:12) 
I, who was once prosperous, have suddenly been crushed. He has seized my hair and torn me apart. He has set me up as a target for arrows.

(Job 16:13) 
His spears have surrounded me. They pierce my kidneys without mercy. He has spilled my entrails upon the earth.

(Job 16:14) 
He cuts me with wound upon wound. He rushes upon me like a mighty warrior.

(Job 16:15) 
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and I have covered my flesh with ashes.

(Job 16:16) 
My face has become swollen from weeping, and my eyelids have grown dark.

(Job 16:17) 
Though there is no iniquity in my hands, and my prayer is pure.

(Job 16:18) 
O Earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry find no hiding place within you!

(Job 16:19) 
For behold, my Witness is in the universe, and my Advocate is in the highest realms.

(Job 16:20) 
My interpreter, my friend, is for me. My eye weeps tears to God.

(Job 16:21) 
Oh, that there might be a judgment between a man and God, just as there is between a man and his neighbor!

(Job 16:22) 
For a few years are passing quickly, and I walk a path from which I will not return.

(Job 17:1) 
My spirit is broken, my days are few, and the grave is all that is left for me.

(Job 17:2) 
All around me, I hear nothing but their taunts. My eyes are consumed with bitterness and grief.

(Job 17:3) 
Grant me a hearing directly before You! Let Your hand be a witness against me. For who else is there who can stand as my guarantor and defend my cause?

(Job 17:4) 
You have removed wisdom from their hearts, from my friends. That is why they will never be raised up in honor.

(Job 17:5) 
He who betrays his companions for profit, making empty promises of gain, will find that his own children’s eyes fail and become blind.

(Job 17:6) 
But He has made me a byword to the peoples, an example for those who have been utterly silenced by suffering.

(Job 17:7) 
My eyes have grown dim from all my grief, and my limbs have wasted away to nothing.

(Job 17:8) 
The righteous will be astonished by what has happened to me, and the innocent will rise up against the hypocrite.

(Job 17:9) 
Yet the righteous will hold firm to his path, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.

(Job 17:10) 
So then, turn back, all of you, and come to me! Yet I still will not find a single wise person among you.

(Job 17:11) 
My days are over. My plans are shattered, and with them, the very torments of my heart have been laid bare.

(Job 17:12) 
They claim to turn night into day, yet I still foolishly hope for light after such darkness.

(Job 17:13) 
If I must only wait, then the grave is my home, and in its darkness I have already made my bed.

(Job 17:14) 
I have said to corruption: “You are my father!” To worms, I have said: “You are my mother and my sister!”

(Job 17:15) 
Where then is my hope now? And where is my patience? Truly, You are my Lord, my God!

(Job 17:16) 
All that I have will descend with me into the deepest earth, and together, we will rest in the dust.

(Job 18:1) 
Bildad from Shuah then responded and spoke:

(Job 18:2) 
“How long will you never stop talking? First, understand what we are saying, and then let us speak clearly.”

(Job 18:3) 
“Why are we regarded as mere animals, and considered vile in your presence?”

(Job 18:4) 
“You are destroying yourself in your fury. But will the created universe then be abandoned because of you, and rocks be moved from their appointed places?”

(Job 18:5) 
“Truly, the light of the ungodly person will be extinguished, and the bright flame of his life will not shine.”

(Job 18:6) 
“The light of his dwelling will turn to darkness, and his lamp, which is over his head, will be utterly extinguished.”

(Job 18:7) 
“His powerful and decisive steps will be hindered, and his own plans will lead to his downfall.”

(Job 18:8) 
“Snares are set for his feet, and he walks right into the traps laid out like nets.”

(Job 18:9) 
“A trap will grasp his foot, and a snare will close tightly upon him.”

(Job 18:10) 
“His trap is hidden in the ground, and a snare for him is set along the path he walks.”

(Job 18:11) 
“On every side, terrors startle him, and they relentlessly pursue his steps.”

(Job 18:12) 
“His physical strength will be weakened by starvation, and thirst will constantly torment him deep within his body.”

(Job 18:13) 
“The 'firstborn of death' will devour the beauty of his skin, and a fatal disease will consume his limbs.”

(Job 18:14) 
“His confidence will be driven from his home, and he will be led to ruin, like a king of terrors leading him to wickedness.”

(Job 18:15) 
“Strangers will live in his former dwelling, and sulfur will be sprinkled over his tent as a sign of utter destruction.”

(Job 18:16) 
“His roots will dry up from above, and his branches below will wither away.”

(Job 18:17) 
“His memory will vanish from the earth, and his name will never be spoken in the public squares.”

(Job 18:18) 
“He will be driven out from the light of the living into complete darkness, and he will be swept away from the face of the entire world.”

(Job 18:19) 
“He will have no children or descendants among his people, and no one remaining in his own lands.”

(Job 18:20) 
“Those who come after him will be astonished at his fate, and those living now will be seized with horror at what happens to him.”

(Job 18:21) 
“These, therefore, are the dwellings of an ungodly person, and this is the ultimate fate of anyone who refuses to acknowledge God.”

(Job 19:1) 
But Job responded by saying:

(Job 19:2) 
“How long will you torment my very soul and crush me with your words?

(Job 19:3) 
Indeed, you have now shamed me many, many times—you repeatedly put me to confusion. And you show no shame in oppressing me.

(Job 19:4) 
Even if I have indeed erred, my error remains with me alone.

(Job 19:5) 
Yet you exalt yourselves against me, and you use my very disgrace as an argument against me.

(Job 19:6) 
Know therefore that it is God who has twisted me into this state, and He has encompassed me with His very power.

(Job 19:7) 
Behold, I will cry out, enduring great violence, and no one will listen to me. I will raise my voice in protest, but there is no one to grant me justice.

(Job 19:8) 
He has walled up my path so I cannot pass through it. He has plunged my journey into darkness.

(Job 19:9) 
He has stripped me of my glory and has taken the crown from my head.

(Job 19:10) 
He has destroyed me from every direction, and I am perishing. Like an uprooted tree, He has torn away my hope.

(Job 19:11) 
Indeed, His fury has been kindled against me, and He has considered me as His very enemy.

(Job 19:12) 
His armies have advanced together, and they have forced their way through me. They have besieged my dwelling on every side.

(Job 19:13) 
He has driven my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances have departed as if they were strangers.

(Job 19:14) 
My closest relatives have forsaken me, and those who knew me have completely forgotten me.

(Job 19:15) 
Even the tenants of my house and my own maidservants have treated me as a stranger, and I have become like a foreigner in their eyes.

(Job 19:16) 
I called my own servant, but he did not answer me. With my very own mouth I had to beg him.

(Job 19:17) 
My wife has abhorred my very breath, and the foul odor from my mouth is repulsive even to the children of my own body.

(Job 19:18) 
Even little children have made me an outcast, and when they rise up, they speak against me.

(Job 19:19) 
My former counselors have abhorred me, and those whom I loved most have turned themselves against me.

(Job 19:20) 
My bone clings to my skin, my flesh having been consumed away. Only my lips remain around my teeth.

(Job 19:21) 
Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you, my friends, for the hand of the Lord has struck me down.

(Job 19:22) 
Why do you persecute me as God does, and why are you not satisfied with devouring my very flesh?

(Job 19:23) 
Oh, that someone would grant me this: that my words might be written down, that they might be inscribed into a book!

(Job 19:24) 
That with an iron stylus and a leaden tablet, or with a chisel, they might be carved into rock, forever!

(Job 19:25) 
For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that at the very end of time I will rise again from the earth.

(Job 19:26) 
And I will again be clothed with my skin, and in my very own flesh I will see my God.

(Job 19:27) 
It is He whom I myself shall see, and my own eyes shall behold Him, and not another's. This is the very hope that is laid up in my heart.

(Job 19:28) 
Why then do you now say, 'How shall we persecute him and find the root of the matter to condemn him?'

(Job 19:29) 
Therefore, flee from the presence of the sword, for the sword is the avenger of iniquities. And know that there will be a judgment.

(Job 20:1) 
Then Zophar the Naamathite responded and said:

(Job 20:2) 
Therefore, my thoughts are agitated and conflicting, and my mind is swept in many directions.

(Job 20:3) 
I hear the argument with which you accuse me, and my inner discernment will speak on my behalf.

(Job 20:4) 
Do you not know this truth, which has been from the very beginning, ever since mankind was placed upon the earth?

(Job 20:5) 
That the exultation of the wicked is short-lived, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only for a moment?

(Job 20:6) 
Even if his arrogance reaches up to the very sky, and his head touches the clouds,

(Job 20:7) 
He will be utterly destroyed like refuse at the end of his life, and those who saw him will say: 'Where has he gone?'

(Job 20:8) 
He will vanish without a trace, like a dream that flies away, and he will flee like a vision seen in the night.

(Job 20:9) 
The eye that once saw him will see him no more, and the place where he lived will not behold him again.

(Job 20:10) 
His children will be reduced to poverty because of his suffering, and his own hands will return his sorrows to him.

(Job 20:11) 
His bones are filled with the iniquities of his youth, and these will lie down with him in the dust of the grave.

(Job 20:12) 
Even if evil tastes sweet in his mouth, so that he hides it under his tongue,

(Job 20:13) 
Even if he cherishes it and will not let it go, hiding it deep within his throat,

(Job 20:14) 
That same bread of evil will turn to viper's venom inside his stomach.

(Job 20:15) 
The riches that he swallowed down, he will vomit up again, for God will extract them from his belly.

(Job 20:16) 
He will suck the venom of serpents, and the viper's tongue will kill him.

(Job 20:17) 
He will not see the abundant flow of streams, nor the rivers flowing with milk and honey.

(Job 20:18) 
He will restore what he gained by his labor, but he will not enjoy it; in proportion to the multitude of his evil deeds, so he suffers, yet he cannot consume them.

(Job 20:19) 
Because he crushed and stripped the poor, and violently seized a house but did not build it fairly.

(Job 20:20) 
His appetite for gain was never satisfied, and even when he had what he desired, he could not truly possess it.

(Job 20:21) 
Nothing remained of his greedy consumption, and because of this, his ill-gotten gains will not endure.

(Job 20:22) 
When he thinks he has enough and is abundant, he will be constrained; then every kind of sorrow will rush upon him.

(Job 20:23) 
God will fill his stomach with retribution; He will send His fierce anger into him and rain His war upon him.

(Job 20:24) 
He will flee from weapons of iron, only to be struck by arrows of bronze.

(Job 20:25) 
An arrow is drawn, it comes out from its quiver, flashing in its bitterness it pierces him: and the horror of death falls upon him.

(Job 20:26) 
Every hidden treasure of his will be lost in darkness; a fire not kindled by human hands will consume him; he will be oppressed and afflicted in his own dwelling.

(Job 20:27) 
The very sky will reveal his iniquity, and the earth itself will rise up against him.

(Job 20:28) 
The harvest of his house will be laid bare and stripped away on the day of God's wrath.

(Job 20:29) 
This is the portion for the wicked man from God, and this is the inheritance ordained by the Lord for his words and deeds.

(Job 20:30) 


(Job 20:31) 


(Job 20:32) 


(Job 20:33) 


(Job 20:34) 


(Job 20:35) 


(Job 20:36) 


(Job 20:37) 


(Job 20:38) 


(Job 20:39) 


(Job 20:40) 


(Job 21:1) 
But Job answered, and then he spoke:

(Job 21:2) 
Please, listen to my words, and reconsider what you believe.

(Job 21:3) 
Bear with me until I have finished speaking; then, after my words, you can laugh at me.

(Job 21:4) 
Are my complaints just about men? No, they are about God. So why wouldn't I grieve over this?

(Job 21:5) 
Listen to me, and be shocked by what I say, then put your finger over your mouth to remain silent.

(Job 21:6) 
Indeed, when I remember these things, I am filled with horror, and a tremor shakes my entire body.

(Job 21:7) 
Why then do the wicked live? They prosper and become powerful with wealth.

(Job 21:8) 
Their children survive to adulthood right before their eyes, and their descendants live with them.

(Job 21:9) 
Their homes are safe from any fear, and the rod of God's judgment is not upon them.

(Job 21:10) 
Their bull mates, and the cow doesn't miscarry; their cow gives birth, and it is never barren.

(Job 21:11) 
They send out their little children like a flock of sheep, and their children skip and dance with joy.

(Job 21:12) 
They celebrate with tambourines and harps, and they rejoice at the sound of the pipe organ.

(Job 21:13) 
They spend their days in prosperity and happiness, and in an instant, they descend into the grave.

(Job 21:14) 
These are the ones who said to God: 'Get away from us! We do not want to know your ways!'

(Job 21:15) 
Who is the Almighty God, that we should serve Him? What benefit would we gain if we prayed to Him?

(Job 21:16) 
Look, their good fortune does not come from their own hands, and may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.

(Job 21:17) 
How often does the lamp of the wicked truly go out, and calamity come upon them? How often does God distribute sorrows in His anger to them?

(Job 21:18) 
Are they truly like chaff before the wind, and like dust that a whirlwind carries away?

(Job 21:19) 
You say God saves the punishment of a man for his children. Let Him punish the man himself, so that the man knows he is being judged.

(Job 21:20) 
Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink deeply of the Almighty's fury.

(Job 21:21) 
For what does the wicked man care about his household after he's gone, even if the number of his months is cut in half?

(Job 21:22) 
Can anyone teach God anything, when He judges even those who are exalted?

(Job 21:23) 
One man dies strong and healthy, rich and content.

(Job 21:24) 
His body is well-fed and full of vigor, and his bones are full of strong marrow.

(Job 21:25) 
And another man dies with a bitter soul, having never known prosperity.

(Job 21:26) 
And both of them will lie down together in the dust, and worms will cover them.

(Job 21:27) 
I certainly know your thoughts, and the judgments by which you try to crush me.

(Job 21:28) 
For you will say: 'Where is the house of the great man? And where are the tents of the wicked?'

(Job 21:29) 
Ask anyone who travels widely, and learn from them what they have observed.

(Job 21:30) 
They will tell you that the evil person is kept safe until the day of their destruction, and is led to the day of wrath.

(Job 21:31) 
Who will directly confront a wicked man about his lifestyle? And who will repay him for what he has done?

(Job 21:32) 
Even he himself is carried to his grave, and will remain among the gathered dead.

(Job 21:33) 
The dust of the grave will be sweet to him when he dies without suffering. And after him, all men are drawn to death, just as countless others have gone before him.

(Job 21:34) 
How then can you comfort me in such a useless way, when your answer clearly contradicts the evidence?

(Job 22:1) 
And Eliphaz the Temanite then answered, saying:

(Job 22:2) 
“Can any human being really benefit God, even when a wise man is useful only to himself?

(Job 22:3) 
What benefit is it to the Most High if you are righteous, or what advantage does He gain if your ways are pure?

(Job 22:4) 
Is it because of your reverence that He judges you, bringing you into judgment?

(Job 22:5) 
Is it not rather that your wickedness is immense, and your iniquities are boundless?

(Job 22:6) 
For you took your brothers’ garments as security for loans, and you left the truly naked without their coverings.

(Job 22:7) 
You gave no water to the weary, and you withheld bread from the hungry.

(Job 22:8) 
By the mere strength of your arm, you took possession of the land, and as the most powerful, you seized it for yourself.

(Job 22:9) 
You sent widows away with nothing, and you crushed the hopes and strength of orphans.

(Job 22:10) 
Because of this, traps surround you, and sudden terror utterly confuses you.

(Job 22:11) 
Or if you want to know what’s coming, it’s darkness, and you will see nothing; a deluge of waters will completely overwhelm you.

(Job 22:12) 
Is God not truly in the highest heavens? Just look at the furthest stars; can you not see how immensely high they are?

(Job 22:13) 
Yet you then say, “What could God possibly know? Can He truly judge through the darkness?”

(Job 22:14) 
You think the clouds hide Him, that He does not consider our affairs, and that He merely walks around the edges of the universe.

(Job 22:15) 
Are you following the ancient path that wicked men have walked?

(Job 22:16) 
Those men were swept away before their time, and a sudden flood washed away their very foundation.

(Job 22:17) 
They were the ones who said to God, “Leave us alone!” and treated the Most High as though He were utterly insignificant.

(Job 22:18) 
Even though He had filled their homes with good things, they rejected Him. May such a thought be far from you.

(Job 22:19) 
The righteous will see this and rejoice, and the innocent will scorn these wicked men, saying:

(Job 22:20) 
“Has not the one who stood against God been utterly cut down, and has not fire consumed what remained of them?”

(Job 22:21) 
Therefore, submit yourself to Him and live in peace; through this, you will attain the most excellent rewards.

(Job 22:22) 
Receive His divine law from His own mouth, and engrave His very words upon your heart.

(Job 22:23) 
If you truly return to the Almighty, you will be restored; and you will remove all wickedness far from your dwelling.

(Job 22:24) 
He will give you gold instead of dust, and for the ordinary stones of the riverbed, He will give you the finest gold of Ophir.

(Job 22:25) 
And the Almighty Himself will stand against your enemies, and silver will be accumulated in abundance for you.

(Job 22:26) 
Then you will find your greatest delight in the Almighty, and you will confidently lift your face to God.

(Job 22:27) 
You will call upon Him in prayer, and He will hear you; then you will fulfill the vows you made.

(Job 22:28) 
You will make a decree, and it will be established for you; and a radiant light will shine upon your path.

(Job 22:29) 
If you have been humbled, you will say, “I was proud,” and the one who casts down his eyes in humility will be saved.

(Job 22:30) 
The innocent person will be saved, and he will be delivered through the purity of his hands.

(Job 23:1) 
Job then spoke and said:

(Job 23:2) 
Even now, my bitterness rises up against me, and my suffering is made heavier by my own groans.

(Job 23:3) 
If only someone would grant me to know Him, to find Him, so I could come all the way to His very throne.

(Job 23:4) 
I would lay out my case before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments against what has happened.

(Job 23:5) 
I would know what words He would use to answer me, and I would understand what He would say to me.

(Job 23:6) 
Would He argue against me with many words? No, He Himself, contending with me, would listen.

(Job 23:7) 
There, a just Judge would speak with me, and I would be set free from my own judgment of myself.

(Job 23:8) 
If I go to the east, He is not there; if to the west, I would not perceive Him.

(Job 23:9) 
If to the north (the left hand), how can He be there? I will not grasp Him. If to the south (the right hand), I will not catch sight of Him.

(Job 23:10) 
But He Himself knows my way. He has tested me like gold, which is purified through fire.

(Job 23:11) 
My foot has followed His footsteps. I have kept His way and have not turned aside from it.

(Job 23:12) 
From the commands of His lips, I have not turned away. I have hidden the words of His mouth in my heart.

(Job 23:13) 
For He alone is God, and no one can turn aside His thoughts. Whatever His soul desires, that He does.

(Job 23:14) 
And when He completes what He wills for me, then He will finish it. Many such things are with Him.

(Job 23:15) 
And because of this, I am troubled before His presence. When I consider it, I am filled with dread.

(Job 23:16) 
God has softened my heart, but the Almighty has also troubled me.

(Job 23:17) 
For the darkness has not vanished from before my face, and deep gloom has covered my face.

(Job 24:1) 
Why doesn't God keep His appointed times hidden? And why do those who know Him not understand His specific days of judgment?

(Job 24:2) 
There are wicked men who move boundary markers to steal land. They violently seize flocks of animals and then feed themselves from them.

(Job 24:3) 
They drive away the donkeys and oxen that belong to orphans, and they take the camel of a widow as collateral, seizing it for themselves.

(Job 24:4) 
They push the poor off the path. All the meek and humble people of the land are forced to hide from them together.

(Job 24:5) 
Look! Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go out to their work, diligently watching for any food they can find. The desolate land itself provides them with their sustenance in their loneliness.

(Job 24:6) 
These wicked men harvest a field that is not theirs. A slanderer will also strip the vineyard of a poor person.

(Job 24:7) 
The poor spend the night naked and without clothing, and they have no covering against the biting cold.

(Job 24:8) 
They are drenched by the mountain rains, and having no shelter, they cling to the bare rock for warmth and protection.

(Job 24:9) 
The wicked steal an orphan from its mother's breast, and they take the cloak of the poor as a pledge, leaving them exposed and destitute.

(Job 24:10) 
So the poor walk around naked and lacking clothing, and, being hungry, they carry sheaves of grain, having gleaned what little they can.

(Job 24:11) 
They labor at noon among the piles of grain, and though they have trodden the wine presses, they still suffer thirst.

(Job 24:12) 
From out of individual cities, groans rise up. The souls of the wounded cry out for justice, yet God does not appear to permit anyone to come to their aid.

(Job 24:13) 
These wicked men are enemies of the light. They do not know its ways, nor do they stay in its paths.

(Job 24:14) 
The murderer rises early in the morning. He kills the needy and the poor, and by night, he becomes like a common thief.

(Job 24:15) 
The eye of the adulterer watches for the deep darkness, saying to himself, 'No eye will see me.' And he covers his face.

(Job 24:16) 
In the darkness, these criminals break into houses as they planned to do in daylight. They will never know the light.

(Job 24:17) 
If the dawn should suddenly appear, they consider it the very shadow of death. So it is that they spend their time dwelling in darkness as if it were their light.

(Job 24:18) 
This wicked man is swift to act on the surface of the earth. May his portion on earth be cursed, and may he no longer work his evil deeds in the path leading to the vineyards.

(Job 24:19) 
Just as drought and heat consume snow water, so too will those who have sinned be swept away to the underworld.

(Job 24:20) 
May mercy completely forget such a man. May the worms not even remember his body's sweetness. Instead, let his wickedness be broken apart like decaying wood.

(Job 24:21) 
This wicked man preys on the barren woman who cannot bear children, and he does not do any good for the widow.

(Job 24:22) 
By his own strength, this man pulls down even the mighty. When he stands, he has no lasting belief in his own life, for his end is coming.

(Job 24:23) 
God seems to lead him to a false sense of security, and he will be sustained there for a time. Yet, God's eyes constantly watch all of their wicked ways.

(Job 24:24) 
The wicked are exalted for a short time, but they will not truly endure. They will be brought low like all other mortals, taken away, and they will collapse like the tops of withered grain stalks.

(Job 24:25) 
If all of this is not true, then who can refute me and clearly demonstrate that my words are a lie?

(Job 25:1) 
Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job by saying this:

(Job 25:2) 
What power and terror God possesses! He is the One who establishes perfect order throughout all the highest heavens.

(Job 25:3) 
Can anyone number God’s armies in the heavens? And is there anyone whom His light does not reach?

(Job 25:4) 
How can any human claim to be righteous when compared to God? Or how can anyone born from a woman truly be pure and clean?

(Job 25:5) 
Behold, even the moon itself does not shine brightly enough in His presence, and even the stars are not pure in His sight.

(Job 25:6) 
How much more, then, is a human being mere decay, and the son of man nothing more than a worm?

(Job 26:1) 
But Job responded and said:

(Job 26:2) 
“Who have you helped? Was it perhaps the weak? And did you strengthen the arm of the powerful?”

(Job 26:3) 
“To whom did you give counsel? Was it perhaps to one lacking wisdom? And have you shown much prudence?”

(Job 26:4) 
“Whom did you wish to teach? Is it not the one who already has spirit and understanding?”

(Job 26:5) 
“Look, the mighty ones groan beneath the waters, along with those who dwell with them.”

(Job 26:6) 
“The underworld is exposed before Him, and there is no covering for the place of destruction.”

(Job 26:7) 
“He stretches out the north over the void, and He hangs the earth upon nothing in the vastness of the universe.”

(Job 26:8) 
“He binds the waters in His clouds, so that they do not burst forth all at once downwards as a flood.”

(Job 26:9) 
“He grasps the face of His throne, spreading His cloud over it, veiling His majesty.”

(Job 26:10) 
“He has drawn a boundary around the waters, reaching to the very edge where light and darkness meet and end in the cosmos.”

(Job 26:11) 
“The very pillars of the universe tremble and are terrified at His command.”

(Job 26:12) 
“By His strength, He stirs up the seas, and by His understanding, He strikes down any proud, rebellious force.”

(Job 26:13) 
“His Spirit adorned the skies with constellations and stars, and by His guiding hand, the twisted Serpent—representing cosmic evil—was brought forth into its appointed place.”

(Job 26:14) 
“Look, these are but the merest fragments of His ways; we have heard only a whisper of His words. For who can truly grasp and contemplate the thunder of His immeasurable greatness?”

(Job 27:1) 
Job then began his solemn discourse again, and said:

(Job 27:2) 
"As surely as God lives, He is the One who has refused to judge my case fairly, and the Almighty is the One who has brought such bitterness to my soul."

(Job 27:3) 
"For as long as there is breath in me, and as long as the life-giving Spirit of God is in my nostrils,"

(Job 27:4) 
"My lips will not speak injustice, nor will my tongue utter any lie."

(Job 27:5) 
"Far be it from me to ever declare you in the right! Until my very last breath, I will not give up my integrity."

(Job 27:6) 
"I will never abandon the righteous defense I have begun to make for myself. Indeed, I do not acknowledge that I have acted unjustly."

(Job 27:7) 
"May my enemy suffer the fate of the wicked, and may my adversary be treated like the unjust."

(Job 27:8) 
"For what hope does the hypocrite have, if he has gained something by violence, yet God does not deliver his soul from judgment?"

(Job 27:9) 
"Will God truly hear his cry when distress overwhelms him?"

(Job 27:10) 
"Or will he take delight in the Almighty, or call upon God at all times?"

(Job 27:11) 
"I will teach you about what God's hand does, and I will not hide from you what belongs to the Almighty."

(Job 27:12) 
"Behold, you all already know this; why then do you speak in vain?"

(Job 27:13) 
"This is the portion of the wicked person from God, and it is the inheritance of violent individuals that they will receive from the Almighty."

(Job 27:14) 
"If his children multiply, they will be destined for the sword; and his descendants will never have enough bread to satisfy them."

(Job 27:15) 
"Those who are left of his family will be buried by a plague, and his widows will not weep for them."

(Job 27:16) 
"If he piles up silver as if it were mere dust from the earth, and if he prepares garments as if they were mud;"

(Job 27:17) 
"He may prepare them indeed, but the righteous person will wear those garments, and the innocent will divide his silver."

(Job 27:18) 
"He built his house like a moth's nest, and he made his shelter like a temporary booth."

(Job 27:19) 
"When the rich man lies down in death, he will take nothing with him. He will open his eyes in the afterlife, and find that he has nothing."

(Job 27:20) 
"Misfortune will seize him like a flood of water, and a whirlwind will snatch him away in the night."

(Job 27:21) 
"A scorching wind will carry him off and sweep him away; like a whirlwind, it will snatch him from his place."

(Job 27:22) 
"God will hurl calamity upon him without mercy; he will desperately try to flee from God's hand."

(Job 27:23) 
"People will clap their hands at him in scorn, and hiss him away from his place."

(Job 28:1) 
Indeed, silver has its origin within specific veins in the earth,
and gold has a designated place where it is melted and purified.

(Job 28:2) 
Iron is extracted from the earth,
and stone, when dissolved by intense heat, is transformed into copper.

(Job 28:3) 
Man himself sets limits to the dark earth, exploring its deep places,
and he pursues all things to their ultimate end.
He also unearths the precious stones from utter darkness and the shadow of death, enduringly searching.

(Job 28:4) 
Man directs streams of water underground to his workings,
and he brings what was hidden deep within the earth out into the light.

(Job 28:5) 
The very earth from which our bread comes is undermined far beneath the surface,
turned over and searched out as if by the intensity of fire.

(Job 28:6) 
Its stones are the source of sapphires,
and its very soil yields gold.

(Job 28:7) 
No bird of prey knows the path to these depths,
nor has the keen eye of a vulture ever seen such places.

(Job 28:8) 
No proud, mighty animal has ever walked this path,
nor has a lioness passed through these passages.

(Job 28:9) 
Man stretches out his hand against the flinty rock,
and he tunnels beneath mountains, overturning them from their foundations.

(Job 28:10) 
He carves out tunnels and channels through the rocks,
and his eye spots every precious thing hidden within them.

(Job 28:11) 
He has explored the depths of rivers,
and he brings forth hidden treasures into the light.

(Job 28:12) 
But true wisdom, where can it be found?
And where is the dwelling place of true understanding?

(Job 28:13) 
Mankind does not know its true value,
nor can it be found in the land of those who live in ease and comfort.

(Job 28:14) 
The great deep says: 'It is not hidden within me,'
and the sea proclaims: 'It is not found with me.'

(Job 28:15) 
No amount of purest refined gold can buy it,
nor can silver be weighed out as a fair exchange for it.

(Job 28:16) 
It cannot be purchased with the finest colored gems from India,
nor can it be compared to the most precious sardonyx or sapphire.

(Job 28:17) 
Neither gold nor precious crystal can be compared to it,
nor can vessels made of pure gold be given in exchange for it.

(Job 28:18) 
Coral and crystal are not even mentioned in comparison to it;
true wisdom, however, is drawn not from these hidden earthly places, but from divine mysteries.

(Job 28:19) 
The finest topaz from Ethiopia cannot equal it,
nor can it be compared to the most intensely colored dyes.

(Job 28:20) 
So, where then does wisdom truly come from?
And what is the actual place where understanding resides?

(Job 28:21) 
It is hidden from the sight of all living beings,
and it is concealed even from the birds of the sky.

(Job 28:22) 
The realms of Destruction and Death themselves have declared:
'We have only heard a rumor of its existence with our own ears.'

(Job 28:23) 
God alone fully comprehends its path,
and He Himself knows its true location.

(Job 28:24) 
For He looks upon all things, even to the very ends of the universe,
and He observes everything that exists under the sky.

(Job 28:25) 
It is He who gave the winds their proper force and weight,
and who measured out the waters with exact precision.

(Job 28:26) 
It was He who established the laws for the rain,
and who set the path for the roaring storms.

(Job 28:27) 
Then He Himself saw wisdom,
He declared its nature, He prepared its dwelling, and He completely understood it.

(Job 28:28) 
And to mankind, He declared:
'Behold, the reverence and holy fear of the Lord—that alone is true wisdom;
and to turn away from evil—that is true understanding.'

(Job 29:1) 
Job then continued his lament, speaking these words:

(Job 29:2) 
Oh, if only I could return to how it was in past months, to those days when God protected me!

(Job 29:3) 
When His lamp shone bright above my head, and I walked through the darkness by His light?

(Job 29:4) 
As I was in the days of my youth, when God's secret presence was with me in my tent?

(Job 29:5) 
When the Almighty was with me, and my children gathered around me?

(Job 29:6) 
When I would wash my feet in cream, and the rock itself would pour out streams of olive oil for me?

(Job 29:7) 
When I went out to the city gate, and set up my seat in the public square?

(Job 29:8) 
The young men saw me and would step aside respectfully, and the elders would rise and show reverence.

(Job 29:9) 
The leaders would stop speaking, and place a finger over their mouths in silence.

(Job 29:10) 
They would make the voices of the noblemen fall silent, and their tongues would stick to the roof of their mouths.

(Job 29:11) 
Every ear that heard me would bless me, and every eye that saw me bore witness in my favor:

(Job 29:12) 
Because I rescued the poor person who cried out for help, and the orphan who had no one to assist him.

(Job 29:13) 
The blessing of the one about to perish came upon me, and I brought comfort to the heart of the widow.

(Job 29:14) 
I clothed myself with righteousness, and it covered me like a garment; my justice was like a royal diadem.

(Job 29:15) 
I was eyes for the blind, and feet for the lame.

(Job 29:16) 
I was a father to the poor, and I diligently investigated any case I did not understand fully.

(Job 29:17) 
I crushed the jaws of the wicked, and snatched the prey from between his teeth.

(Job 29:18) 
And I said to myself: “I will die in my own nest, and I will multiply my days like the palm tree.”

(Job 29:19) 
My root was spread out beside the waters, and the dew would remain on my harvest.

(Job 29:20) 
My glory would always be renewed, and my bow in my hand would be restored to strength.

(Job 29:21) 
Those who heard me waited patiently, and they kept silent, paying close attention to my counsel.

(Job 29:22) 
After my words, they would not add anything further; and my discourse would fall upon them like gentle rain.

(Job 29:23) 
They waited for me as they would for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the late spring showers.

(Job 29:24) 
If I ever smiled at them, they could hardly believe it, and the light of my countenance settled upon them.

(Job 29:25) 
If I wanted to go to them, I would sit as the first among them; and when I sat, it was like a king surrounded by his army, and I was a comforter to those who mourned.

(Job 30:1) 
But now, those who are younger than I openly ridicule me. Their own fathers I would not have allowed to even sit with the sheepdogs of my own flock.

(Job 30:2) 
The physical strength of their hands was entirely useless; their whole life was considered nothing but refuse and filth.

(Job 30:3) 
They were utterly destitute and barren from hunger, gnawing on roots and scraps in the wilderness, wasting away with calamity and misery.

(Job 30:4) 
They chewed on wild herbs and tree bark, and juniper roots were all the food they had.

(Job 30:5) 
They were driven away from settled places into the middle of ravines, living in caves carved into the earth and among piles of sand.

(Job 30:6) 
They lay hidden in the crevices and caverns of the rocks, among thorns and under nettles.

(Job 30:7) 
They were accustomed to making animal-like noises among the thorns and hiding under the nettles.

(Job 30:8) 
They were the sons of fools and nobodies, utterly erased from the memory of the land, without any name or standing.

(Job 30:9) 
Now, I have become the subject of their mocking songs; I have become like a proverb or a byword to them.

(Job 30:10) 
They detest me and flee far from my presence; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.

(Job 30:11) 
Because God has loosened my bowstring and afflicted me, they have also broken the restraint they once had against me.

(Job 30:12) 
On my right, they rise up together, tripping my feet and barricading my pathways as if with surging waves.

(Job 30:13) 
They destroy my paths, they lie in ambush for me, and they gain the victory, and there is no one who will help me.

(Job 30:14) 
Like a breach in a wall or an open gate, they have rushed in upon me; they break into my life as if it were a devastated city.

(Job 30:15) 
My paths have been reduced to nothing; my patience has been swept away like the wind, and my salvation has departed like a fleeting cloud.

(Job 30:16) 
But now, my very soul is melted within me, and days of affliction have taken possession of me.

(Job 30:17) 
At night, my very bones are pierced with pain, and those things which consume me do not rest.

(Job 30:18) 
By their great number, my clothing is vexed and torn, and they have surrounded me like a tightly-woven garment.

(Job 30:19) 
God has thrown me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.

(Job 30:20) 
I cry out to you, God, but you do not hear me; I stand before you, but you do not look at me.

(Job 30:21) 
You have changed your disposition toward me, becoming cruel; with the hardness of your hand, you oppose me.

(Job 30:22) 
You lifted me up, as if setting me upon the wind, and then you dashed me down with powerful waves.

(Job 30:23) 
For I know that you will hand me over to death, to that place appointed for all who live.

(Job 30:24) 
Yet, no one will stretch out their hand against those already consumed; even if they are in ruin, they themselves will be saved.

(Job 30:25) 
I once wept over those who were afflicted, and my soul grieved for the poor.

(Job 30:26) 
I was expecting good to come, but instead, evil came to me; I looked for light, but darkness erupted.

(Job 30:27) 
My inner being is in turmoil without any rest; days of affliction have come upon me.

(Job 30:28) 
I walked about in mourning, without my former strength, rising up in the public assembly, I cried out in agony.

(Job 30:29) 
I have become a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches, living among the desolate.

(Job 30:30) 
My skin has turned black upon me, and my bones are parched from the heat of my suffering.

(Job 30:31) 
My harp is turned to mourning, and my pipe plays the sound of those who weep.

(Job 31:1) 
I made a solemn promise to my own eyes, to never even let my thoughts dwell on an unmarried woman with lust.

(Job 31:2) 
For what reward would I then expect from God in heaven, what inheritance from the Almighty Lord on high?

(Job 31:3) 
Isn’t there misfortune for evil people? Isn’t there ruin for those who commit injustice?

(Job 31:4) 
Doesn’t God Himself carefully observe all my paths, and meticulously count every single step I take?

(Job 31:5) 
If I have lived a life of deceit, or if my feet have eagerly rushed toward dishonesty,

(Job 31:6) 
then let God weigh me on a truly just scale, and He will know my integrity and sincerity.

(Job 31:7) 
If my steps have ever strayed from the righteous path, or if my heart has followed after what my eyes desired unlawfully, or if any injustice has stained my hands through my actions:

(Job 31:8) 
then let me plant my crops only for another to eat them, and let my whole family line be utterly wiped out.

(Job 31:9) 
If my heart has ever been seduced by another man's wife, and if I have ever lurked near my neighbor’s door with ill intent:

(Job 31:10) 
then let my own wife grind grain for another man, and let another man have relations with her.

(Job 31:11) 
For this kind of act is a most disgraceful crime, indeed, a very great wickedness.

(Job 31:12) 
It is like a consuming fire that burns all the way down to destruction, uprooting and destroying all the fruits of my life.

(Job 31:13) 
If I have ever ignored the just complaints of my male servant or my female servant, when they had a dispute against me:

(Job 31:14) 
what then will I do when God rises up to judge? And when He questions me about it, what answer will I give Him?

(Job 31:15) 
Didn't the very same God who made me in my mother's womb also make them? And didn't the same God form all of us, each one in the womb?

(Job 31:16) 
If I have ever denied the poor what they needed, or if I have caused the eyes of a widow to become weak with desperate longing for help:

(Job 31:17) 
if I have ever eaten my portion of bread alone, and an orphan did not eat from it alongside me:

(Job 31:18) 
(For from my infancy, I was raised with the orphan as if I were a father to them, and from my mother’s womb, the orphan has always been with me in my care and concern):

(Job 31:19) 
if I have ever seen someone perishing because they had no clothing, or a poor person who had nothing to cover themselves with:

(Job 31:20) 
if their loins have not blessed me, meaning if they have not felt relief and gratitude, and if they have not been warmed by the wool from my own sheep:

(Job 31:21) 
if I have ever lifted my hand against an orphan, even when I saw that I had the upper hand and legal advantage in the city gate:

(Job 31:22) 
then let my arm fall from its shoulder, and let it be broken into pieces along with all my bones.

(Job 31:23) 
For I have always regarded God as a looming threat over me, and I could not bear the weight of His judgment for such sins.

(Job 31:24) 
If I ever considered gold to be my strength, or if I said to fine gold, 'You are my ultimate trust and security':

(Job 31:25) 
if I have ever rejoiced greatly over my vast riches, or because my hand had acquired much wealth:

(Job 31:26) 
if I have ever looked at the sun when it shone brightly, or at the moon as it moved clearly through the night sky:

(Job 31:27) 
and in secret, my heart was glad with a forbidden joy, and my mouth kissed my hand in a gesture of idolatry towards them:

(Job 31:28) 
this too would be a most grievous sin of judgment, for I would have denied the great God who is above all creation.

(Job 31:29) 
If I have ever rejoiced at the downfall of someone who hated me, or exulted because evil had befallen him:

(Job 31:30) 
for I have never allowed my mouth to sin by uttering a curse, wishing for his death or destruction.

(Job 31:31) 
If the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find someone who has not been satisfied with his meat?' meaning, who has not been fed generously by Job:

(Job 31:32) 
the stranger never stayed outside my home, and my door was always open to the traveler.

(Job 31:33) 
If I have ever concealed my wrongdoing like other men do, hiding my iniquity deep within my own heart:

(Job 31:34) 
if I have been too afraid of the great multitude, and troubled more than I ought by the contempt of my relatives, and because of that, I kept silent, and did not go out my door to do justice.

(Job 31:35) 
Oh, that someone would listen to me now! I desire that the Almighty in heaven write down His charges against me in a book.

(Job 31:36) 
Truly, I would carry it on my shoulder, and bind it around myself like a crown of honor.

(Job 31:37) 
I would declare to Him an account of my every step and action, and present it to Him as if I were a prince.

(Job 31:38) 
If my land has ever cried out against me, and if its furrows have wept along with it, indicating I seized it unjustly:

(Job 31:39) 
if I have eaten its produce without paying for it, and if I have oppressed the souls of its laborers:

(Job 31:40) 
then let thistles grow for me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley. Here ends the discourse of Job.

(Job 32:1) 
So these three men stopped answering Job because he was convinced of his own righteousness.

(Job 32:2) 
But Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. His anger burned because Job declared himself righteous before God.

(Job 32:3) 
Furthermore, he was angry with Job's three friends, because they had failed to find a proper answer to Job, and instead had only condemned him.

(Job 32:4) 
So Elihu waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than him.

(Job 32:5) 
When he saw that the three men had no further answers to offer, he became extremely angry.

(Job 32:6) 
So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, began to speak. He said: 'I am young, and you are elders, so I was respectful and feared to speak my opinion to you.'

(Job 32:7) 
For I thought, 'Surely older men will speak, and the abundance of years will teach wisdom.'

(Job 32:8) 
But truly, there is a spirit within human beings, and the inspiration of the Almighty God gives understanding.

(Job 32:9) 
It is not necessarily the great in stature who are wise, nor do only the aged possess true judgment.

(Job 32:10) 
That is why I said, 'Listen to me; I also will present my opinion to you.'

(Job 32:11) 
For I waited for your speeches, I listened closely to your reasoning, until your discourse was finished.

(Job 32:12) 
I paid close attention to all of you, and indeed, none of you could refute Job or provide a suitable response to his arguments.

(Job 32:13) 
Do not say in your hearts, 'We have found wisdom here; God is the one who will prove him wrong, not a human being.'

(Job 32:14) 
Job's arguments were not directed at you, so I will not answer him using your arguments.

(Job 32:15) 
They were dismayed; they replied no more, having nothing further to say.

(Job 32:16) 
Since I waited and they did not speak, since they stood silent and gave no more replies,

(Job 32:17) 
I will also give my part in answering, and I will make known what I know.

(Job 32:18) 
For I am full of words, and the spirit within me presses upon me.

(Job 32:19) 
My inner being is like new wine that has no vent, like new wineskins that are about to burst.

(Job 32:20) 
I must speak to find relief; I will open my lips and reply.

(Job 32:21) 
I will not show partiality to any man, nor will I flatter any human being.

(Job 32:22) 
For I do not know how long I will endure, and if my Maker will take me away soon.

(Job 33:1) 
Therefore, Job, pay attention to my message. Listen carefully to everything I am about to say.

(Job 33:2) 
Go ahead and speak, if you have anything to say.

(Job 33:3) 
But if you have nothing to say, then listen to me. I will speak words to you that will give you understanding and life.

(Job 33:4) 
God's Spirit made me, and the very breath of the Almighty gave me life.

(Job 33:5) 
If you can, then answer me. Stand here before me and present your case.

(Job 33:6) 
Look, I am just like you, made from clay. I was also formed from the same earth.

(Job 33:7) 
My authority won't terrify you, and my seriousness won't overwhelm you.

(Job 33:8) 
You have spoken these things within my hearing, and I have listened to the sound of your words.

(Job 33:9) 
You said, 'I am pure, without sin. I am spotless and without any wrongdoing.'

(Job 33:10) 
You claim that God found reasons to accuse you, and therefore He considered you His enemy.

(Job 33:11) 
You said He put your foot in a snare and watched all your paths.

(Job 33:12) 
Listen, in this you are not justified, and I will answer you: for God is greater than any human being.

(Job 33:13) 
Why do you argue against Him? It's because He does not respond to all your words.

(Job 33:14) 
God speaks once, and then a second time, though not always repeating the exact same message.

(Job 33:15) 
He speaks through dreams in a night vision, when a deep sleep falls upon people and they are sleeping in their beds.

(Job 33:16) 
Then He opens the ears of men, and by instructing them, He teaches them wisdom and discipline.

(Job 33:17) 
This is to turn a person away from the wrong things he is doing and to free him from his pride.

(Job 33:18) 
He instructs his very self to rescue it from the pit of destruction, and to prevent his life from passing into the realm of the dead.

(Job 33:19) 
He also corrects a person through pain on his sickbed, and his bones are crushed as if by a moth.

(Job 33:20) 
During his illness, food becomes repulsive to him, and his very self rejects his most basic nourishment.

(Job 33:21) 
His flesh wastes away, and his bones, which had been covered, become exposed.

(Job 33:22) 
His very self draws near to decay, and his life approaches the innermost chambers of death.

(Job 33:23) 
If there is an angel with him—one of a thousand—who can declare a person's uprightness,

(Job 33:24) 
Then the angel will have mercy on him and say: 'Deliver him so that he does not go down into destruction; I have found a ransom for him.'

(Job 33:25) 
His flesh will be restored like that of a child, and he will return to the vigor of his youth.

(Job 33:26) 
He will pray to God, and God will be favorable to him. He will see God's face with joy, and God will restore his righteousness to him.

(Job 33:27) 
He will look at others and declare: 'I have sinned, and indeed I have done wrong, and I did not receive what I deserved.'

(Job 33:28) 
God rescued my very self from entering destruction, and my life will see the light of life.

(Job 33:29) 
See, God does all these things three times, with each individual person.

(Job 33:30) 
He does this to bring their very selves back from decay and to illuminate them with the light of the living.

(Job 33:31) 
Pay attention, Job, and listen to me. Be silent, and I will speak.

(Job 33:32) 
But if you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I wish for you to be justified.

(Job 33:33) 
But if not, then listen to me and be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.

(Job 34:1) 
Eliu then continued speaking, saying:

(Job 34:2) 
“Listen to my words, you who are wise, and you who are learned in the ways of God, give heed to what I say.

(Job 34:3) 
For just as the mouth tastes and discerns food, so the ears judge and discern words.

(Job 34:4) 
Let us choose what is right and just for ourselves, and let us together discern what is truly best.

(Job 34:5) 
For Job has said: ‘I am righteous, and God has turned away my judgment, refusing to acknowledge my innocence.

(Job 34:6) 
He has lied, saying: ‘My cause is one of violence and injustice; my wound has been inflicted without any fault or sin on my part.’

(Job 34:7) 
Who is there like Job, who drinks down scorn and anger as if it were water, saturating himself with bitterness?

(Job 34:8) 
He walks and associates with those who commit wickedness, and he keeps company with impious men.

(Job 34:9) 
For he has declared: ‘It will not please a man, even if he strives to run with God, to be righteous.’ This means that striving for God's approval is fruitless.

(Job 34:10) 
Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding and insight: may ungodliness and wickedness be far from God, and may injustice be far from God the Father Almighty.

(Job 34:11) 
But He will surely repay each person for his work, and He will restore to each according to their individual ways and deeds.

(Job 34:12) 
Truly, God will not act impiously, nor will the Almighty ever subvert justice.

(Job 34:13) 
Who else gave Him the earth? Or who founded the world that He now rules? No one.

(Job 34:14) 
If He were to direct His attention to Himself alone, and withdraw His own Spirit and the breath of life back to Himself from all creation,

(Job 34:15) 
then all flesh would perish together instantly, and every human being would return to dust.

(Job 34:16) 
Therefore, if you possess understanding, hear what I am saying, and listen carefully to the voice of my discourse.

(Job 34:17) 
Can one who does not love justice endure? And how can you condemn Him who is righteous, mighty, and perfectly executes justice?

(Job 34:18) 
Is it right to say to a king, ‘You are a renegade!’ or to call rulers, ‘You are impious!’?

(Job 34:19) 
God does not show partiality to princes, nor does He regard a tyrant more than a shepherd, because all are the work of His hands.

(Job 34:20) 
In a moment they will die, and suddenly in the middle of the night, peoples will be troubled and pass away; and the violent one will be taken away without any human hand.

(Job 34:21) 
For His eyes are upon the ways of men, and He considers all their steps and movements.

(Job 34:22) 
There are no dark places, nor is there any shadow of death deep enough for those who commit wickedness to hide themselves there from Him.

(Job 34:23) 
For God does not need to extend His examination further, nor does He summon a man to come before Him for judgment in the way human courts do.

(Job 34:24) 
He crushes many countless individuals, and He raises up others in their place.

(Job 34:25) 
For He knows their works, and therefore He brings the darkness of punishment upon them, and they are crushed.

(Job 34:26) 
He strikes them down as impious men in a place where all can see.

(Job 34:27) 
They deliberately turned away from Him, and they refused to understand all of His ways and commands.

(Job 34:28) 
This means they caused the cry of the poor to reach Him, and He heard the voices of the needy.

(Job 34:29) 
If He Himself grants peace and rest, who then can condemn? If He hides His face, who can behold Him? This applies to both nations and to all individual human beings.

(Job 34:30) 
He allows a hypocritical man to reign as king because of the sins of the people.

(Job 34:31) 
Will anyone say to God: ‘I have received my just punishment, I will not sin again’?

(Job 34:32) 
If I have offended unknowingly, teach me what I did wrong; if I have committed iniquity, I will not add to it further.

(Job 34:33) 
Will God reckon it according to your judgment, because you have resisted Him? For you, not I, choose what you believe; and if you know anything better, speak it now.

(Job 34:34) 
Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hear what I say.

(Job 34:35) 
But Job has spoken with foolish discourse, and his words do not sound like true instruction or wisdom.

(Job 34:36) 
For this reason, I pray to the Father that Job be tested to the very end,

(Job 34:37) 
because he adds transgression to his sin, and in all his words, he provokes us, and challenges God Himself.

(Job 35:1) 
Eliu spoke again, and he said:

(Job 35:2) 
Do you think it is right for you to declare, 'I am more righteous than God?'

(Job 35:3) 
For you have said, 'What profit is there for You, O God, if I do not sin?'

(Job 35:4) 
I will speak to you concerning this, and to your friends who are with you.

(Job 35:5) 
Look up at the universe, and observe it; behold the skies, which are higher than you.

(Job 35:6) 
If you have sinned, how do you harm God? And if your iniquities are multiplied, what do you do to Him?

(Job 35:7) 
If you have acted righteously, what do you give to Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?

(Job 35:8) 
Your wickedness harms only a human being who is like you; and your righteousness helps only a son of man.

(Job 35:9) 
Because of the many oppressions from powerful rulers, people cry out and wail for rescue from violent power.

(Job 35:10) 
Yet no one says, 'Where is God, my Creator, who gives songs of comfort in the darkest night?'

(Job 35:11) 
He who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky, is not questioned.

(Job 35:12) 
There, people will cry out, but God will not hear them because of the arrogance and pride of the wicked.

(Job 35:13) 
Therefore, God does not hear their prayers in vain, for the Almighty does not look upon empty pleas without cause.

(Job 35:14) 
How much more so, when you say, 'God does not judge, He sets aside your cause, and you must just wait for Him.'

(Job 35:15) 
But for now, He does not judge, though judgment is before Him, and you are enduring this trial.

(Job 35:16) 
Therefore, Job vainly opens his mouth, and without true knowledge multiplies his words.

(Job 35:17) 
Have I not spoken to you, to prove that you think yourself more righteous than God?

(Job 35:18) 
You say: 'I suffer much, and I am not heard, nor is there anyone to vindicate me.'

(Job 35:19) 
And Eliu said: 'I will yet speak words from God to show you that my Maker is just.'

(Job 35:20) 
You will be able to learn knowledge from my words, and not as if they came from myself alone.

(Job 35:21) 
Truly, I will speak my discourse without deceit, and there is no falsehood in me.

(Job 35:22) 
But the Lord is powerful in strength, and He possesses knowledge beyond any comparison.

(Job 35:23) 
He does not cast away anyone who trusts in Him; and He executes judgment on all who hope in Him.

(Job 35:24) 
Indeed, He is more powerful than any people, and there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:25) 
There is no one who dares to oppose Him; and there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:26) 
And who will say to Him: 'What are You doing?' Or who will set himself against Him?

(Job 35:27) 
Remember to praise His work, about which people have sung.

(Job 35:28) 
All humanity has seen it, and from afar they have contemplated it in its height.

(Job 35:29) 
Behold, God is great, excelling in knowledge, and who is from many years ago, that is, eternal.

(Job 35:30) 
He who executes judgment, there is no one like Him.

(Job 35:31) 
There is no one who is like Him in strength, or who can set himself against Him.

(Job 35:32) 
He who executes judgment, there is no one like Him.

(Job 35:33) 
He has put wisdom in their hearts, yet there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:34) 
Behold, this One is great, and we do not know Him; His years are beyond number, and there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:35) 
Can you truly know His paths, and understand His ways, and yet there is no one who is like Him?

(Job 35:36) 
He who arranges the skies, yet there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:37) 
And He who has ordered His works, yet there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:38) 
Who can simultaneously understand all the works of God, which exist from eternity, and yet there is no one who is like Him?

(Job 35:39) 
And He who has given them knowledge, yet there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 35:40) 
He who performs great and inscrutable wonders, yet there is no one who is like Him.

(Job 36:1) 
Elihu then continued to speak, saying these things:

(Job 36:2) 
Wait for me for a short while, and I will show you; for I still have more to say, speaking on God’s behalf.

(Job 36:3) 
I will review my wisdom from its very beginning, and with my words, I will prove that my Creator is just.

(Job 36:4) 
Truly, my words are without falsehood, for perfect knowledge will be proven to you.

(Job 36:5) 
God is powerful, and He rejects no one, for He is mighty in the strength of His will.

(Job 36:6) 
He does not save the impious, but He grants justice to the poor.

(Job 36:7) 
He does not turn His eyes away from the just; He sets up kings on their thrones, and establishes them firmly forever.

(Job 36:8) 
If they are held captive in chains, and are bound by the cords of affliction:

(Job 36:9) 
He reveals to them their works, and their transgressions, because they have gone too far.

(Job 36:10) 
He also opens their ears to receive correction, and He speaks so that they might turn away from wickedness.

(Job 36:11) 
If they listen and obey, they will live out their days in prosperity, and their years in honor.

(Job 36:12) 
But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword, and will be consumed by their own folly.

(Job 36:13) 
Those who are hypocritical and cunning provoke God’s wrath, and they will not cry out to Him when they are bound in affliction.

(Job 36:14) 
Their lives will end in disaster, and their time will be spent among the spiritually weak and defiled.

(Job 36:15) 
He delivers the afflicted from their distress through His justice, and opens their ears to hear Him in times of trouble.

(Job 36:16) 
Thus, He will deliver you from the narrow straits of trouble, where there is no firm ground beneath you. Then your rest will be filled with abundance.

(Job 36:17) 
Your cause has been judged as if it were the judgment of the wicked; yet you will receive justice and righteous judgment from God.

(Job 36:18) 
Therefore, do not let your anger lead you into arrogance; be careful lest by many bribes, you are led astray.

(Job 36:19) 
Your cry will not rescue you from affliction, nor will all the mightiest men be able to help you.

(Job 36:20) 
Do not long for the night, when people are suddenly swept away from their places.

(Job 36:21) 
Be careful not to turn toward wickedness, for you have begun to pursue this path after your affliction.

(Job 36:22) 
Behold, God is exalted in His power, and there is no lawgiver like Him.

(Job 36:23) 
Who can examine His ways, or who can say to Him, 'You have done wrong'?

(Job 36:24) 
Remember to magnify His works, of which men have sung praises.

(Job 36:25) 
All mankind has seen them, yet man beholds them from afar.

(Job 36:26) 
Behold, God is great, surpassing our knowledge; the number of His years is immeasurable.

(Job 36:27) 
He draws up the tiny drops of water, and pours out the rains like surging floods.

(Job 36:28) 
which distill from the clouds, and fall as rain upon many people.

(Job 36:29) 
If He chooses to spread out the clouds like His canopy, and to illuminate their farthest reaches.

(Job 36:30) 
Behold, He extends His light over them, and He covers the foundations of the sea.

(Job 36:31) 
For by these —elements of nature— He judges nations, and provides food for many people.

(Job 36:32) 
He holds the lightning bolts in His hands, and commands them where to strike.

(Job 36:33) 
His thunder announces its presence —referring to the lightning— proclaiming that it is His own possession, and speaks of its rising power.

(Job 37:1) 
At this, my heart trembles in awe, and it is shaken from its place.

(Job 37:2) 
Listen closely, listen to the rumbling roar of God’s voice, and the sound of it as it proceeds from His mouth.

(Job 37:3) 
God causes His lightning to streak across the entire sky, and its light flashes to the very ends of the earth.

(Job 37:4) 
After this, the thunder will roar; God will make it thunder with the majestic sound of His voice. And no one can stop it once His voice is heard.

(Job 37:5) 
God thunders with His voice in a wonderful way, for He does great and unfathomable things.

(Job 37:6) 
He commands the snow to fall upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the downpour of His great power.

(Job 37:7) 
By His hand, God stops all men from their work, so that each one may reflect on what he has done.

(Job 37:8) 
The wild beasts will enter their lairs, and will stay in their dens.

(Job 37:9) 
From the deep clouds comes the tempest, and from the North comes the bitter cold.

(Job 37:10) 
At the breath of God, frost is given, and the vast expanses of water become hard ice.

(Job 37:11) 
The grain yearns for the clouds to bring rain, yet the clouds also scatter forth their light—the lightning.

(Job 37:12) 
The clouds move about in every direction, wherever His will leads them, to fulfill every command He gives them across the surface of the whole earth.

(Job 37:13) 
He causes them to appear either for a specific region or people, or for His own land, or for any other particular purpose He has given them.

(Job 37:14) 
Listen to this, O Job; stand still and contemplate the wonderful works of God.

(Job 37:15) 
Do you know when God commands the rains to come, so that they might reveal the light of His cloud—the lightning?

(Job 37:16) 
Do you understand the vast paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledge of Him who directs them?

(Job 37:17) 
Why are your garments warm, when the earth is swept by the south wind?

(Job 37:18) 
Can you, then, create the skies with Him, which are as firm as a cast bronze mirror?

(Job 37:19) 
Tell us what we should say to Him, for we are blinded by His glory and do not know what words to speak.

(Job 37:20) 
Can it be told to God what I would speak? Or if a man speaks, will he not be consumed?

(Job 37:21) 
Now, men cannot see the light, for the air is thickened with hailstones turned to ice.

(Job 37:22) 
From the north comes a golden splendor, and around God is terrible majesty.

(Job 37:23) 
We cannot comprehend the Almighty; He is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and with unspeakable goodness He does not afflict without cause.

(Job 37:24) 
Therefore, men will fear Him, and all who consider themselves wise will not be able to comprehend Him.

(Job 38:1) 
But the Lord responded to Job from a great whirlwind. He said to him:

(Job 38:2) 
Who is this person who clouds wise counsel with words that show no understanding?

(Job 38:3) 
Prepare yourself like a strong man ready for battle. I will ask you questions, and you must answer Me.

(Job 38:4) 
Where were you when I laid the very foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you truly possess understanding.

(Job 38:5) 
Who was it that determined its dimensions—if you truly know? Or who stretched out a measuring line to mark its boundaries?

(Job 38:6) 
Upon what were its supporting columns fixed and solidified? Or who was it that carefully laid its foundational cornerstone,

(Job 38:7) 
while the morning stars sang together in praise, and all the spiritual beings — the sons of God — shouted aloud with joy?

(Job 38:8) 
Who was it that enclosed the vast sea with doors, as it burst forth from the earth as if from a womb?

(Job 38:9) 
When I used the clouds as its covering garment, and wrapped it in thick, dark mist like swaddling clothes?

(Job 38:10) 
I established its precise boundaries with My decree, and placed strong bars and mighty doors to contain it;

(Job 38:11) 
and I declared: 'You may come this far, but you shall not advance any further. Here, your proud, swelling waves will be broken and subdued.'

(Job 38:12) 
Have you, since your birth as a human, ever commanded the morning to appear, or shown the dawn its proper place to rise?

(Job 38:13) 
Have you ever taken hold of the very edges of the earth to shake them, or dislodged the wicked from its surface through such an action?

(Job 38:14) 
The form of the earth is changed as clay is molded by a seal, and its features become distinct, like a well-formed garment.

(Job 38:15) 
From the wicked, their light and prosperity will be taken away, and their powerful arm — their strength and pride — will be utterly broken.

(Job 38:16) 
Have you ever ventured into the deepest parts of the ocean, or walked in the farthest, hidden recesses of the primordial deep?

(Job 38:17) 
Have the gates of death ever been opened for you, revealing their secrets, or have the dark, shadowy doors of the underworld unveiled themselves to you?

(Job 38:18) 
Have you truly comprehended the vast expanse of the earth? Tell Me, if you claim to know everything.

(Job 38:19) 
Along what pathway does light truly dwell, and where is the specific dwelling place of darkness?

(Job 38:20) 
Are you able to guide each—light and darkness—to its proper boundaries, and do you comprehend the pathways within its own domain?

(Job 38:21) 
Did you know all of this then, perhaps because you were already born and had lived for many days?

(Job 38:22) 
Have you ever entered the vast storehouses of snow, or beheld the immense treasuries where hail is kept,

(Job 38:23) 
which I have prepared and reserved for times of distress, for the day of battle and cosmic warfare?

(Job 38:24) 
By what unseen pathway is light distributed and scattered across the sky, and by what mechanism is heat diffused over the entire earth?

(Job 38:25) 
Who has determined the course for the most torrential rains, and who has forged a specific pathway for the lightning bolt that accompanies thunder?

(Job 38:26) 
causing rain to fall even upon the earth where no man resides, in the desolate wilderness where no mortal human dwells;

(Job 38:27) 
so that He might fill the desolate, untraveled wasteland with water, and cause even the most basic green grass to sprout forth?

(Job 38:28) 
Who is the true father of the rain, bringing it into existence? Or who gave birth to the countless tiny drops of dew?

(Job 38:29) 
From whose mighty womb did the ice emerge? And who brought forth the frost from the very atmosphere?

(Job 38:30) 
The waters harden like stone, becoming solid ice, and the great deep — even the primordial water bodies — becomes frozen in its usual flow.

(Job 38:31) 
Are you able to bind together the beautiful cluster of stars known as the Pleiades, or can you loosen the tight bands that hold the constellation Arcturus in its course?

(Job 38:32) 
Do you bring forth the morning star, Lucifer, at its appointed time, and do you cause the evening star to rise over all the inhabitants of the earth?

(Job 38:33) 
Do you understand the cosmic laws and ordinances that govern the universe, and can you establish their effects and rules here on earth?

(Job 38:34) 
Can you raise your voice into the clouds to command them, and would a torrent of water obediently cover you upon your word?

(Job 38:35) 
Can you dispatch lightning bolts, and will they obediently go forth, returning to you to report, 'Here we are, ready to do your bidding'?

(Job 38:36) 
Who has endowed humanity with wisdom in their innermost being? Or who has granted the rooster its natural instinct and understanding?

(Job 38:37) 
Who possesses the wisdom to count the clouds and determine their celestial purpose? And who can silence the harmonious 'music' of the universe when it produces rain?

(Job 38:38) 
When the loose dust of the earth becomes so dry that it forms a solid mass, and the soil's clods cling tightly together due to extreme drought.

(Job 38:39) 
Are you able to hunt for the lioness to secure her prey, and can you fully satisfy the hungry appetite of her young cubs?

(Job 38:40) 
when they lie hidden in their lairs, and patiently lurk in their dens, waiting for their quarry?

(Job 39:1) 
Do you know when the wild deer give birth to their fawns among the rocks? Or have you carefully observed the birth of the hinds, the female deer?

(Job 39:2) 
Have you precisely counted the months of their pregnancy? And do you truly know the exact moment they will give birth?

(Job 39:3) 
They curve themselves down to give birth. They labor and deliver their young, releasing their cries.

(Job 39:4) 
Their young grow strong and fat. They go out to graze, then they depart and do not return to their mothers.

(Job 39:5) 
Who has set the wild ass free? Who has loosened the chains from the wild ass, allowing it to roam?

(Job 39:6) 
I have given the wild ass its home in the wilderness, and its dwelling place in the barren, salty land.

(Job 39:7) 
It despises the crowded city, and it does not hear the shouts of the driver forcing it to work.

(Job 39:8) 
It wanders over the mountain pastures, searching for every green plant it can find.

(Job 39:9) 
Will the wild ox choose to serve you? Or will it remain by your feeding trough?

(Job 39:10) 
Can you bind the wild ox to a plow so that it will cut furrows behind you?

(Job 39:11) 
Will you place your trust in its immense strength? Will you leave your hard work entirely to it?

(Job 39:12) 
Will you believe that it will return to you after leaving, and gather your grain into your threshing floor?

(Job 39:13) 
The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron and the hawk.

(Job 39:14) 
When it abandons its eggs on the ground, you, oh Job, would actually try to keep them warm on the dust.

(Job 39:15) 
It forgets that a foot might crush them, or that a wild animal of the field might break them.

(Job 39:16) 
It is hardened toward its own children, as if they were not its own. It has labored in vain, without any fear for them.

(Job 39:17) 
For God deprived the ostrich of wisdom, and did not give it understanding.

(Job 39:18) 
But when the moment comes for it to run, it raises its wings high; it mocks the horse and its rider.

(Job 39:19) 
Do you bestow strength upon the horse? Or do you adorn its neck with a powerful mane and the sound of its neigh?

(Job 39:20) 
Do you make it leap like a locust? The majestic snorting from its nostrils is terrifying.

(Job 39:21) 
With its hoof, it paws the ground, and it exults with boldness. It charges directly into armed men.

(Job 39:22) 
It despises fear and does not flinch from the sword.

(Job 39:23) 
Above it, the quiver rattles. The spear and shield flash.

(Job 39:24) 
Fierce and raging, it seems to devour the ground. It cannot believe that the trumpet has sounded the charge.

(Job 39:25) 
When it hears the war trumpet, it cries out, “Aha!” From afar, it scents the battle, the exhortations of the commanders, and the war cry of the army.

(Job 39:26) 
Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars upward, spreading its wings to the south wind?

(Job 39:27) 
Is it at your command that the eagle rises high and builds its nest in the lofty, inaccessible places?

(Job 39:28) 
It dwells among the crags and stays on the jagged, inaccessible cliffs.

(Job 39:29) 
From there, it watches for its food, and its eyes spot prey from far away.

(Job 39:30) 
Its young ones drink blood. Wherever a carcass is, there it is immediately present.

(Job 39:31) 
And the Lord answered Job from the midst of a whirlwind, saying:

(Job 39:32) 
Will you contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God answer Him now.

(Job 39:33) 
And Job answered the Lord, saying:

(Job 39:34) 
What can I answer, I who am so unworthy before you? I will place my hand over my mouth in silence.

(Job 39:35) 
I have spoken once, but now I retract it. And if I were to speak a second time, I would add nothing further.

(Job 39:36) 
And the Lord answered Job again from the midst of the whirlwind, saying:

(Job 39:37) 
Gird your loins like a man of strength! I will question you, and you must answer me.

(Job 39:38) 
Will you really nullify my judgment? And will you condemn me in order to justify yourself?

(Job 39:39) 
Do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like His?

(Job 39:40) 
Adorn yourself with splendor and majesty, and clothe yourself with strength and glory.

(Job 40:1) 
And the Lord responded to Job, saying:

(Job 40:2) 
Will the one who disputes with the Almighty now continue? Let the one who would argue against God answer Him now.

(Job 40:3) 
And Job responded to the Lord, saying:

(Job 40:4) 
Shall I speak any further, I who have already spoken too much? Or should I place my hand over my mouth?

(Job 40:5) 
I have said one thing, and I will not add to it; I have said another, and I will not repeat it.

(Job 40:6) 
And the Lord responded to Job from out of the whirlwind, saying:

(Job 40:7) 
Gird your loins like a man; I will question you, and you must answer Me.

(Job 40:8) 
Will you then annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me, so that you may be justified?

(Job 40:9) 
Do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like His?

(Job 40:10) 
Adorn yourself with splendor and supreme majesty; clothe yourself with strength and glory.

(Job 40:11) 
Unleash the full force of your furious anger; look upon everyone who is proud and humble him.

(Job 40:12) 
Look upon all the proud and confound them; crush the wicked in their place.

(Job 40:13) 
Hide them all in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit of the grave.

(Job 40:14) 
Then I Myself will confess that your own right hand can save you.

(Job 40:15) 
Look now at Behemoth, whom I made just as I made you; he eats grass like an ox.

(Job 40:16) 
His strength is in his loins, and his power is in the muscles of his belly.

(Job 40:17) 
He makes his tail stiff like a cedar tree; the sinews of his thighs are intertwined.

(Job 40:18) 
His bones are like tubes of bronze; his cartilage is like plates of iron.

(Job 40:19) 
He is the first among God's creations; only his Maker can bring His sword against him.

(Job 40:20) 
The mountains yield their grass for him; all the beasts of the field play near him.

(Job 40:21) 
He sleeps under the shade, in the secret hiding place of the reeds, and in marshy places.

(Job 40:22) 
The shade of trees covers him; the willows by the brook surround him.

(Job 40:23) 
See, he drinks up a river without concern, and he is confident that even the Jordan can flow into his mouth.

(Job 40:24) 
Can anyone take him by the eyes with a hook? Or pierce his nose with a snare?

(Job 40:25) 
Can you pull out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or tie down his tongue with a rope?

(Job 40:26) 
Can you put a ring in his nose? Or pierce his jaw with a hook?

(Job 40:27) 
Will he multiply supplications to you? Or will he speak soft words to you?

(Job 40:28) 
Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as your perpetual servant?

(Job 40:29) 
Can you play with him as with a bird? Or bind him for your servant girls?

(Job 40:30) 
Will traders barter for him? Will merchants divide him up?

(Job 40:31) 
Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishermen's spears?

(Job 40:32) 
Lay your hand upon him; remember the battle, and do not try again.

(Job 41:1) 
Can you pull out Leviathan with a fishhook, or tie his tongue with a rope?

(Job 41:2) 
Can you put a rope through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a spike?

(Job 41:3) 
Will he often beg you for mercy, or speak gentle words to you?

(Job 41:4) 
Will he make a covenant with you, so you can take him as your slave for all time?

(Job 41:5) 
Will you play with him as if he were a bird, or tie him up for your servant girls to keep?

(Job 41:6) 
Will trading partners make a feast out of him? Will merchants divide him up for sale?

(Job 41:7) 
Can you fill his skin with fishing darts, or his head with harpoons?

(Job 41:8) 
Try to lay your hand on him. You will remember the battle, and you will not try again.

(Job 41:9) 
Look, any hope of yours will be disappointed, and you will be overthrown by his mere presence.

(Job 41:10) 
No one is so fierce that he would dare to provoke him. Who then would dare to stand before my face? — This is God speaking, implying that if you cannot face Leviathan, you certainly cannot face God.

(Job 41:11) 
Who has ever given Me anything first, that I should have to repay him? Everything under all of creation is mine.

(Job 41:12) 
I will not keep silent about him, or about his mighty strength, or his perfectly-formed ability to resist.

(Job 41:13) 
Who can strip off his outer hide, or penetrate his double armor?

(Job 41:14) 
Who can open the doors of his mouth? His terrifying teeth are all around it.

(Job 41:15) 
His body is like cast metal shields, joined together with tight seals, like stones.

(Job 41:16) 
One scale is joined tightly to another, so no breath can pass between them.

(Job 41:17) 
Each scale clings to the next, holding so tightly they cannot be separated.

(Job 41:18) 
His sneeze flashes like fire, and his eyes are like the bright rays of dawn.

(Job 41:19) 
From his mouth burst forth torches, and sparks of fire shoot out.

(Job 41:20) 
Smoke pours from his nostrils, like from a boiling pot or a burning cauldron.

(Job 41:21) 
His breath sets coals ablaze, and flame comes forth from his mouth.

(Job 41:22) 
Strength dwells in his neck, and terror dances before his face.

(Job 41:23) 
The parts of his flesh cling together tightly; if you strike him, he will not be moved.

(Job 41:24) 
His heart is hard as stone, and as immovable as the lower millstone.

(Job 41:25) 
When he rises up, the mighty will be afraid, and when terrified, they will be utterly dismayed.

(Job 41:26) 
If a sword strikes him, it will not hold. Spears, javelins, and armor are useless against him.

(Job 41:27) 
He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.

(Job 41:28) 
An arrow will not make him flee; sling-stones turned against him become like stubble.

(Job 41:29) 
He regards a club as straw, and he laughs at the shaking spear.

(Job 41:30) 
Beneath him are the rays of the sun (as he moves through the water), and all gold beneath him he treats as mud.

(Job 41:31) 
He makes the deep sea boil like a pot, and makes the sea like a frothing ointment.

(Job 41:32) 
Behind him, a shining path appears, and he makes the deep seem to grow old with his passage.

(Job 41:33) 
There is no power on earth that can be compared to him, for he was made to fear nothing.

(Job 41:34) 
He looks down on all who are haughty, for he is king over all the children of pride.

(Job 42:1) 
Then Job answered the Lord and said:

(Job 42:2) 
I know that you can accomplish all things, and no plan of yours can be thwarted.

(Job 42:3) 
—Who am I, that I should obscure your divine counsel without true knowledge?— Therefore, I have spoken unwisely, speaking of things that utterly exceeded my comprehension.

(Job 42:4) 
—You said to me, "Listen, and I will speak; I will question you, and you respond to me."

(Job 42:5) 
I had heard of you only by the hearing of my ear, but now my very own eyes see you.

(Job 42:6) 
Therefore, I utterly condemn myself for my prior words, and I repent in dust and ashes.

(Job 42:7) 
But after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken what is right before me, as my servant Job has."

(Job 42:8) 
Therefore, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his intercession so that your folly may not be counted against you. For you have not spoken what is right to me, as my servant Job has."

(Job 42:9) 
So Eliphaz the Temanite, Baldad the Shuhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord had commanded them, and the Lord accepted Job's intercession.

(Job 42:10) 
The Lord also turned Job's captivity to repentance—meaning He restored Job's fortunes and peace—when Job prayed for his friends. And the Lord doubled all that Job had possessed before.

(Job 42:11) 
Then all his brothers and all his sisters came to him, and all who had known him previously. They ate bread with him in his house, and they mourned with him and comforted him concerning all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him. Each of them also gave him a piece of money and a gold earring.

(Job 42:12) 
Now the Lord blessed Job's latter end even more than his beginning. And Job had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.

(Job 42:13) 
He also had seven sons and three daughters.

(Job 42:14) 
He named the first daughter Day, the second Cassia, and the third Cornustibii.

(Job 42:15) 
There were no women found throughout the entire land as beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.

(Job 42:16) 
After these things, Job lived one hundred and forty years, and he saw his children and his children's children, even to the fourth generation.

(Job 42:17) 
And so he died, an old man and full of days.
