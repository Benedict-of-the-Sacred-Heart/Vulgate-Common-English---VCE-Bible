(Joshua 1:1) 
Now, it came to pass that after the death of Moses, the servant of God, God spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, who had been Moses' assistant, saying:

(Joshua 1:2) 
My servant Moses is dead. Now, you and all the people with you must get up and cross this Jordan River into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.

(Joshua 1:3) 
Every single place that your foot steps upon, I will give to you, just as I promised Moses.

(Joshua 1:4) 
From the desert and from Lebanon, stretching all the way to the great Euphrates River—all the land of the Hittites, all the way to the Great Sea in the west—that will be your territory's boundary.

(Joshua 1:5) 
No one will be able to stand against you throughout your entire life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you, nor will I ever desert you.

(Joshua 1:6) 
Be strong and courageous! For you are the one who will divide by lot this land among this people—the land which I swore to their ancestors I would give to them.

(Joshua 1:7) 
Only be very strong and very courageous! So that you carefully observe and faithfully do everything in the entire Law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it, neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may act wisely in everything you do.

(Joshua 1:8) 
Do not let this Book of the Law ever depart from your mouth. Instead, meditate on it day and night, so that you may diligently observe and do everything that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous, and you will understand and succeed.

(Joshua 1:9) 
Listen! I am commanding you right now: Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid, and do not be terrified! Because the Lord your God is with you everywhere you go, no matter what you face.

(Joshua 1:10) 
And Joshua then gave orders to the leaders of the people, saying:

(Joshua 1:11) 
Go through the camp and command the people, saying: 'Prepare your provisions, because after three days, you will cross the Jordan River and go in to take possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving to you.'

(Joshua 1:12) 
Joshua also spoke to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,

(Joshua 1:13) 
Remember the word that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you rest and this entire land.'

(Joshua 1:14) 
Your wives, your children, and your livestock will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan River. But all of you, every strong, armed man, will cross over ahead of your brothers, fully equipped for battle, and you will help them,

(Joshua 1:15) 
until the Lord gives rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you, and they themselves take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving to them. Then you may return to your own land, the land of your inheritance, and settle there, the land which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to you beyond the Jordan River, on the east side.

(Joshua 1:16) 
And they responded to Joshua, saying: 'We will do everything that you have commanded us, and wherever you send us, we will go.

(Joshua 1:17) 
Just as we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will also obey you. Only let the Lord your God be with you, just as He was with Moses.

(Joshua 1:18) 
Anyone who rebels against your authority and does not obey all the words that you command him will be put to death. Only you must be strong and act with courage.

(Joshua 2:1) 
So Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies. He commanded them: "Go and observe the land, especially the city of Jericho." The two men departed and entered the house of a harlot named Rahab, and they lodged there.

(Joshua 2:2) 
It was reported to the king of Jericho, with the message: "Look, some men from the children of Israel have entered this place tonight to spy out the land."

(Joshua 2:3) 
So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying: "Bring out the men who have entered your house, because they are spies, and they have come to survey all the land."

(Joshua 2:4) 
The woman, however, had taken the men and hidden them. She then spoke this way: "Indeed, men came to me, but I did not know from where they were coming."

(Joshua 2:5) 
When the city gates were about to be closed in the dark, they left. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, and you will surely overtake them.'"

(Joshua 2:6) 
She, however, had made the men go up to the roof of her house and hidden them under stalks of flax.

(Joshua 2:7) 
Indeed, those who had been sent by the king pursued them along the road that leads to the Jordan, all the way to the fords. As soon as the pursuers went out, the city gates were immediately closed.

(Joshua 2:8) 
But before the spies lay down to sleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof and said:

(Joshua 2:9) 
"I know that the Lord God has given you this land, and that your terror has fallen upon us. Indeed, a great fear of you has seized all the inhabitants of these lands."

(Joshua 2:10) 
"We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were on the other side of the Jordan, whom you utterly destroyed."

(Joshua 2:11) 
"And from that moment, no courage has remained within us, because we were terrified by your impending arrival. For the Lord your God, He alone is God in the universe above and on the earth below."

(Joshua 2:12) 
"Now therefore, swear to me by the Lord that just as I have shown kindness to you, so also you will show kindness to my father's household. And give me a sure sign, a true promise,"

(Joshua 2:13) 
"—that you will save my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that belongs to them, and that you will deliver our lives from death."

(Joshua 2:14) 
The men answered her: "Our lives for yours, even unto death, if you do not betray this matter of ours. When the Lord delivers this land to us, we will show you kindness and faithfulness."

(Joshua 2:15) 
Then she let them down by a rope through the window, because her house was built into the city wall, and she lived in the wall itself.

(Joshua 2:16) 
And she said to them: "Go to the mountain, so that the men sent to pursue you do not encounter you. Hide there for three days until they have returned. Then, you may go on your way."

(Joshua 2:17) 
The spies said to her: "We will be free from this oath, by which you have bound us, under certain conditions,

(Joshua 2:18) 
—if, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down. You must also gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your relatives into your house."

(Joshua 2:19) 
"If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone inside the house with you is harmed, their blood will be on our heads."

(Joshua 2:20) 
"However, if you betray this matter of ours, then we will also be free from this oath by which you have made us swear."

(Joshua 2:21) 
She replied: "As you have spoken, so let it be." Then she sent them away, and when they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord in the window.

(Joshua 2:22) 
The men then went to the mountain and remained there for three days, until those who had pursued them returned. For the pursuers searched along all the roads but did not find them.

(Joshua 2:23) 
After three days, the two men returned. They descended from the mountain, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They recounted to him everything that had happened to them,

(Joshua 2:24) 
and said: "The Lord has truly delivered all this land into our hands, for all its inhabitants are trembling in fear because of us."

(Joshua 2:1) 
So Joshua, the son of Nun, secretly sent two men as spies from the region of Settim. He instructed them: “Go, and carefully observe the land, especially the city of Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a woman who was a harlot, named Rahab, and they stayed there with her.

(Joshua 2:2) 
And it was reported to the king of Jericho that some men from the children of Israel had come there that night to spy out the land.

(Joshua 2:3) 
So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying: “Bring out the men who have entered your house, for they are spies who have come to examine the whole land.”

(Joshua 2:4) 
But the woman took the men and hid them. She then spoke: “It is true, some men did come to me, but I did not know where they were from.

(Joshua 2:5) 
When the city gate was about to be shut in the darkness of evening, the men left. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, and you will surely overtake them.”

(Joshua 2:6) 
Now, the woman had actually made the men go up to the roof of her house and had hidden them under stalks of flax that were laid out there.

(Joshua 2:7) 
The king’s men went out after them on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan River. Immediately after the king’s men left, the city gate was closed.

(Joshua 2:8) 
Before the spies lay down to sleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof and spoke, saying:

(Joshua 2:9) 
“I know that the Lord has given this land over to you, and that our terror has fallen upon you. Indeed, the fear of you has completely disheartened all the inhabitants of this land.

(Joshua 2:10) 
We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were across the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

(Joshua 2:11) 
Since no one else is coming into this land, we are terrified and dismayed. Indeed, the fear of you has fallen upon all its inhabitants. For the Lord your God, He is God in the sky above, and on the earth below.

(Joshua 2:12) 
Now therefore, I ask you, swear to me by the Lord, because I have shown mercy to you, that you also will show mercy to my father’s household. Give me a sure sign—

(Joshua 2:13) 
that you will spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”

(Joshua 2:14) 
The men answered her: “May our lives be pledged for yours in death, if only you do not betray this agreement of ours. When the Lord delivers this land to us, we will show you mercy and faithfulness.”

(Joshua 2:15) 
So she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall.

(Joshua 2:16) 
And she said to them: “Go to the mountains, lest those who were sent to capture you might find you. Hide there for three days until they return. After that, you can go on your way.”

(Joshua 2:17) 
The spies then said to her: “We will be released from this oath which you have made us swear,

(Joshua 2:18) 
if, when we enter this land, you tie this scarlet rope in the window through which you let us down, and if you gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your relatives into your house.

(Joshua 2:19) 
If anyone from your family ventures outside the doors of your house, his death will be his own responsibility—we will be innocent. However, if we are betrayed by you, then this word of our promise will become null and void.”

(Joshua 2:20) 
And she answered: “May it be as you have spoken.” So she sent them away, and they left. Then she tied the scarlet rope in the window.

(Joshua 2:21) 
So they departed and came to the mountain pass, and they remained there for three days until those who had pursued them returned. The pursuers had searched along every road, but they found nothing.

(Joshua 2:22) 
Then the two men returned. They came down from the mountain, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They recounted to him everything that had happened to them.

(Joshua 2:23) 
They said: “The Lord has indeed delivered all the land into our hands! And all its inhabitants are terrified with fear of us.”

(Joshua 2:24) 
They declared: “The Lord has truly given all the land into our hands, for all its inhabitants are utterly demoralized by the fear of us.”

(Joshua 3:1) 
Joshua rose from sleep during the night and moved the camp from Shittim. He, along with all the children of Israel, came to the Jordan River, and they remained there for three days, waiting to begin their crossing.

(Joshua 3:2) 
After three days, officials went throughout the camp,

(Joshua 3:3) 
and commanded them, saying: 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, carried by the priests from the tribe of Levi, you also must get up and follow in their footsteps.'

(Joshua 3:4) 
'But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits (which is roughly half a mile) between yourselves and the Ark. This way you can see it from afar and know by which path you should go, because you have never passed this way before.'

(Joshua 3:5) 
Then Joshua said to the people: 'Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will perform wonders among you.'

(Joshua 3:6) 
And he said to the priests: 'Take up the Ark of the Covenant and go before the people.' So they took it up, as commanded, and carried it.

(Joshua 3:7) 
Then the Lord said to Joshua: 'Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.'

(Joshua 3:8) 
'You, therefore, command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant and tell them: 'When you step into the edge of the water of the Jordan, stand still in the Jordan River.''

(Joshua 3:9) 
Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: 'Come here, and listen to the words of the Lord your God.'

(Joshua 3:10) 
And again he said: 'By this you shall know that the Lord, the living God, is among you, and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.'

(Joshua 3:11) 
'Behold, the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you through the Jordan River.'

(Joshua 3:12) 
'Now therefore, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.'

(Joshua 3:13) 
'And when the feet of the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth touch the waters of the Jordan, the waters that flow downstream will be cut off and will fail. But the waters coming down from upstream will stand still, gathering into a single heap.'

(Joshua 3:14) 
So the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant went before them.

(Joshua 3:15) 
When they had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who carried the Ark were dipped into the very edge of the water (for the Jordan River at that time overflowed all its banks during the season of the wheat harvest),

(Joshua 3:16) 
the waters flowing downstream stood still in one place, rising up like a mountain, far away at the city of Adam, which is on the side of Zaretan. And those waters that flowed further down toward the Dead Sea, which is the Salt Sea, completely drained away.

(Joshua 3:17) 
Meanwhile, the people crossed over opposite Jericho. And the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River, while all the people passed over on the dry riverbed, until everyone had crossed the Jordan.

(Joshua 3:18) 
When everyone had completely crossed over, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 3:19) 
'Choose twelve men, one from each tribe,'

(Joshua 3:20) 
'and command them to take twelve very hard stones from the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, from the very place where the priests' feet stood. You shall place these stones in the location of the camp where you are going to pitch your tents tonight.'

(Joshua 3:21) 
So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the children of Israel, one from each tribe,

(Joshua 3:22) 
and he said to them: 'Go before the Ark of the Lord your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,

(Joshua 3:23) 
'Let this be a sign among you. And when your children ask you tomorrow, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'

(Joshua 3:24) 
'then you shall tell them: 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it crossed over. For this reason these stones are set as a memorial for the children of Israel forever.''

(Joshua 3:25) 
So the children of Israel did just as Joshua commanded. They carried twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, just as the Lord had told him, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, to the place where they had pitched their camp. There they set them down.

(Joshua 3:26) 
Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant had stood. And those stones are there to this very day.

(Joshua 3:27) 
Meanwhile, the priests who carried the Ark stood in the middle of the Jordan Riverbed until everything was completed that Joshua had commanded the people to do, speaking on behalf of the Lord. And the people hurried to cross over.

(Joshua 3:28) 
When everyone had crossed over, then the Ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over ahead of the people.

(Joshua 3:29) 
The sons of Reuben, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, armed for battle, marched ahead of the children of Israel, just as Moses had commanded them.

(Joshua 3:30) 
About forty thousand armed warriors, ready for battle, crossed over onto the plains of the city of Jericho.

(Joshua 3:31) 
On that day, the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, so that they feared him just as they had feared Moses, for all the days of Joshua's life.

(Joshua 3:32) 
And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 3:33) 
'Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River.'

(Joshua 3:34) 
So Joshua commanded the priests, saying: 'Come up out of the Jordan River!'

(Joshua 3:35) 
As the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came up, and as soon as the soles of their feet touched the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their channel and flowed as they did before, overflowing all their banks.

(Joshua 3:36) 
The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, on the eastern border of Jericho.

(Joshua 3:37) 
And the twelve stones, which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.

(Joshua 3:38) 
And he said to the children of Israel: 'When your children ask their fathers tomorrow, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'

(Joshua 3:39) 
'then you shall teach them and say: 'Israel crossed over this Jordan River on dry ground,'

(Joshua 3:40) 
'because the Lord your God dried up its waters before you, until you had crossed over, just as He did previously in the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we crossed.'

(Joshua 3:1) 
Joshua rose early in the morning and moved the camp from Abel. He, along with all the children of Israel, came to the Jordan River. There they stayed for three days.

(Joshua 3:2) 
After the three days had passed, the officers went throughout the camp,

(Joshua 3:3) 
and they gave orders to the people, saying: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, with the priests of the tribe of Levi carrying it, then you yourselves must also get up and follow them.

(Joshua 3:4) 
But there must be a great distance between you and the ark; do not approach it. This distance should be about two thousand cubits, which is approximately half a mile. Then you will know which way to go, because you have never traveled this path before.

(Joshua 3:5) 
Joshua also said to the people: "Sanctify yourselves, meaning, prepare yourselves spiritually and physically. For tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you."

(Joshua 3:6) 
And he said to the priests: "Take up the ark of the covenant and go before the people." So they did as they were commanded; they took up the ark and went ahead of them.

(Joshua 3:7) 
Then the Lord said to Joshua: "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will also be with you.

(Joshua 3:8) 
Command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant and tell them: 'When you have entered part of the water of the Jordan River, stand still in the Jordan itself.'"

(Joshua 3:9) 
Joshua then said to the children of Israel: "Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God."

(Joshua 3:10) 
And he continued: "By this, you will know that the living God is in your midst, and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and also the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.

(Joshua 3:11) 
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you through the Jordan River.

(Joshua 3:12) 
Now therefore, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.

(Joshua 3:13) 
And when the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the God of all the earth, touch the waters of the Jordan, the waters that flow downstream will be cut off and will run dry. But the waters coming down from upstream will stand still, forming a single heap in one place.

(Joshua 3:14) 
So the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests who carried the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.

(Joshua 3:15) 
And as soon as they entered the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who carried the ark were dipped in the edge of the water—for the Jordan usually overflows all its banks during the time of the wheat harvest—

(Joshua 3:16) 
the waters coming down from upstream stood still in one heap, swelling up like a mountain far away, near the city of Adam, which is in the region of Zaretan. And the waters that were flowing downstream continued to flow into the Sea of the Desert (which is now called the Dead Sea) until they completely disappeared. Meanwhile, the people stood opposite Jericho, across the Jordan.

(Joshua 3:17) 
But the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River. And all the people passed over on the dry riverbed until everyone had completely crossed the Jordan.

(Joshua 4:1) 
After all the people of Israel had completely finished crossing the Jordan River, the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 4:2) 
'Choose twelve men from among the Israelite people—one man specifically from each of the twelve tribes.'

(Joshua 4:3) 
'And command them, saying: "Take up twelve large stones from the very middle of the Jordan River's bed, from the precise spot where the priests' feet stood firm and dry. You are to carry these stones and set them down at the campsite where you will pitch your tents tonight."'

(Joshua 4:4) 
So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared and appointed from among the sons of Israel—one man chosen from each of the tribes.

(Joshua 4:5) 
And Joshua said to them, 'Go ahead of the Ark of the Lord your God, into the very middle of the Jordan River. Let each one of you then lift a large stone onto his shoulder, so there will be one stone for each of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.'

(Joshua 4:6) 
'These stones are to serve as a perpetual sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, saying: "What do these stones mean?"'

(Joshua 4:7) 
'You are to answer them by saying: "It is because the waters of the Jordan River were completely cut off and dried up before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it crossed over the Jordan! These stones were set up as a permanent memorial for the sons of Israel, to last for all time."

(Joshua 4:8) 
So the sons of Israel did exactly as Joshua had commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River's bed, just as the Lord God Himself had commanded them, one stone for each of the tribes of Israel. They carried them to their campsite and set them up there.

(Joshua 4:9) 
Furthermore, Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the very middle of the Jordan River, at the precise spot where the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant had stood dry. Those stones remain there even to this very day as a witness.

(Joshua 4:10) 
Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark remained standing firmly in the middle of the Jordan River. They stood there until everything the Lord God had commanded Joshua to tell the people was fully accomplished, just as Moses had instructed Joshua concerning all these things. And the people quickly hurried across the dry riverbed.

(Joshua 4:11) 
After all the Israelite people had completely crossed the river, the Ark of the Lord and the priests then moved from the riverbed and crossed over to the land, proceeding to lead the people forward.

(Joshua 4:12) 
And the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, marched ahead of the other sons of Israel, just as Moses had specifically commanded them to do earlier.

(Joshua 4:13) 
About forty thousand armed men, organized into their various companies and divisions, fully equipped and ready for battle, crossed over to the plains outside Jericho.

(Joshua 4:14) 
On that very day, the Lord God exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel. From that point on, the people honored him and held him in reverent awe, just as they had honored Moses, for all the days of Joshua's life.

(Joshua 4:15) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 4:16) 
'Command the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River bed.'

(Joshua 4:17) 
So Joshua immediately commanded the priests, saying: 'Come up now, out of the Jordan River!'

(Joshua 4:18) 
And as soon as the priests, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, came up out of the middle of the Jordan River's bed, and the soles of their feet were firmly planted on the dry ground of the bank, the waters of the Jordan immediately rushed back into their channel. And the river began to flow over all its banks again, just as it had been flowing before the miracle.

(Joshua 4:19) 
The Israelite people crossed up out of the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month. They then set up their camp at Gilgal, which is located on the eastern side of the city of Jericho.

(Joshua 4:20) 
And Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they had taken from the Jordan River's bed, at Gilgal, as a permanent monument.

(Joshua 4:21) 
Joshua then spoke to the sons of Israel and said: 'In the future, when your children ask their fathers, saying: "What do these stones mean?"'

(Joshua 4:22) 
'You are to teach them and explain: "The Israelite people crossed over this Jordan River on completely dry ground—a great miracle!"'

(Joshua 4:23) 
'...just as the Lord your God did at the Red Sea, which He completely dried up before us until we had all finished crossing through it.'

(Joshua 4:24) 
'...so that all the peoples of the earth may know and understand the incredibly powerful hand of the Lord God—and so that you, the Israelite people, may also revere and fear the Lord your God for all your days, always remembering His mighty acts.'

(Joshua 4:1) 
After everyone had finished crossing over the Jordan River, the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 4:2) 
“Choose twelve men from the people, one man for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.

(Joshua 4:3) 
Then command them to take twelve very hard stones from the middle of the Jordan River, from the exact spot where the priests’ feet stood still. You are to place these stones in the location where you will set up your tents tonight.”

(Joshua 4:4) 
So Joshua called the twelve men he had selected from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe.

(Joshua 4:5) 
And he told them, “Go before the Ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan River. Each of you must carry one stone on your shoulder, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.

(Joshua 4:6) 
This is to be a sign among you, so that when your children ask you in the future, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’

(Joshua 4:7) 
You will answer them: ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off and stopped flowing before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it crossed over the river. That is why these stones are set as a memorial for the sons of Israel forevermore.’”

(Joshua 4:8) 
So the sons of Israel did exactly as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River, just as the Lord God had commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them to the place where they were going to set up their tents for the night. And there they set them down.

(Joshua 4:9) 
Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River, right where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant had stood. These stones remain there even to this present day.

(Joshua 4:10) 
The priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant stood firm in the middle of the Jordan, until everything the Lord God had commanded Joshua to tell the people was completed, just as Moses had instructed him. And the people quickly crossed over.

(Joshua 4:11) 
After all the people had completely crossed over, the Ark of the Lord God and the priests crossed over as well, moving in front of the people.

(Joshua 4:12) 
Also, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh went ahead of the other sons of Israel, just as Moses had commanded them to do.

(Joshua 4:13) 
About forty thousand armed men, arrayed in battle formations, crossed over before the Lord God for battle on the plains near the city of Jericho.

(Joshua 4:14) 
On that very day, the Lord God made Joshua great in the sight of all Israel. So the people feared him, just as they had feared Moses throughout all the days of his life.

(Joshua 4:15) 
Then the Lord God spoke to Joshua again, saying:

(Joshua 4:16) 
“Command the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River.”

(Joshua 4:17) 
So Joshua gave them the command, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan River.”

(Joshua 4:18) 
As soon as the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord God came up from the middle of the Jordan River, and their feet touched the dry ground on the other bank, the waters of the Jordan returned to their usual course. The river flowed as it did before, covering all its banks.

(Joshua 4:19) 
The people themselves came up from the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month. They camped at Gilgal, which is on the eastern side of the city of Jericho.

(Joshua 4:20) 
Joshua also set up the twelve stones, which they had taken from the middle of the Jordan River, at Gilgal.

(Joshua 4:21) 
And he said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in the time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to us?’

(Joshua 4:22) 
You will instruct them and say: ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan River on dry ground through the riverbed.

(Joshua 4:23) 
The Lord our God dried up its waters before us until we had completely crossed over.

(Joshua 4:24) 
This was just like what He did once before at the Red Sea, which He also dried up before us until we had completely crossed over. This miracle happened so that all the peoples of the earth may learn that the hand of the Lord God is very mighty, and so that you yourselves may always revere the Lord your God.’”

(Joshua 5:1) 
After all the kings of the Amorites, who lived on the western side of the Jordan River, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who lived by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan River before the children of Israel, until they had all crossed over, their hearts were dismayed and they were greatly afraid. There was no more courage left in them, because they feared the entry of the children of Israel into their land.

(Joshua 5:2) 
At that time, the Lord said to Joshua: "Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the children of Israel a second time."

(Joshua 5:3) 
So Joshua made very sharp flint knives from a rock, and he circumcised the children of Israel on the Hill of Foreskins.

(Joshua 5:4) 
Now, this is the reason for the second circumcision: all the male people who had come out of Egypt, all the fighting men, had died in the wilderness along the very long journey.

(Joshua 5:5) 
All these men had been circumcised in Egypt; but in the desert, after they had left Egypt, their children were born uncircumcised.

(Joshua 5:6) 
For the children of Israel walked through the desert for forty years, until all the multitude of fighting men who had come out of Egypt were consumed—who had not obeyed the voice of the Lord. The Lord had sworn to them that He would not show them the land flowing with milk and honey, a most excellent and fertile land.

(Joshua 5:7) 
Therefore, the sons of these men succeeded their fathers, and they themselves were circumcised by Joshua, because they were still in their foreskins just as they had been born, and no one had circumcised them on the journey.

(Joshua 5:8) 
After everyone was circumcised, they remained in the same place in the camp until they recovered.

(Joshua 5:9) 
Then the Lord said to Joshua: "Today, I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you." And the name of that place has been called Gilgal even to this present day.

(Joshua 5:10) 
So the children of Israel remained in Gilgal and celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.

(Joshua 5:11) 
And on the very next day, they ate from the produce of the land: unleavened bread and parched grain from that very year.

(Joshua 5:12) 
And the manna ceased, after they had eaten from the produce of the land. The children of Israel no longer used it as food, but instead ate from the produce of that current year from the land of Canaan.

(Joshua 5:13) 
While Joshua was in the field near Jericho, he lifted his eyes and saw a man standing opposite him, holding a drawn sword. Joshua, terrified, went to him and said: "Are you one of us, or one of our enemies?"

(Joshua 5:14) 
He replied: "Neither. I am the commander of the army of the Lord, and now I have come." Joshua fell on his face to the earth, worshipped, and said: "What does my Lord say to His servant?"

(Joshua 5:15) 
And the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua: "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." And Joshua did as he had been commanded.

(Joshua 6:1) 
Jericho was completely shut down and fortified because of the fear of the Israelites—the inhabitants had locked themselves inside, and no one could enter or leave.

(Joshua 6:2) 
The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, "Listen, I have given Jericho into your power, along with its king and all of its mighty warriors."

(Joshua 6:3) 
"All of you warriors, march around the city once each day, and you shall do this for six days."

(Joshua 6:4) 
"And seven priests shall carry seven ram's horn trumpets—the kind used for the Jubilee celebration—and they shall walk before the Ark of the Covenant. But on the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow their trumpets loudly."

(Joshua 6:5) 
"Then, when the ram's horn trumpet sounds a long and sustained blast, and it rings in your ears, all the people shall shout with a great roar, and the city walls will collapse completely, down to their very foundations. Then, each man shall enter the city straight ahead, wherever he stands."

(Joshua 6:6) 
So Joshua called the priests and said to them, "Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and let seven other priests carry the Jubilee ram's horn trumpets before the Ark of the Lord."

(Joshua 6:7) 
And to the people he said, "Go, and march around the city. Let the armed men lead the way before the Ark of the Lord."

(Joshua 6:8) 
So, just as Joshua had commanded, while the people carried the Ark of the Lord, seven priests, holding seven ram's horn trumpets, went forward before the Ark of the Lord and blew their trumpets.

(Joshua 6:9) 
The armed men went first, before the priests who carried the trumpets. The rest of the multitude followed the procession, and the trumpets continued to sound.

(Joshua 6:10) 
Joshua had commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout, and your voice shall not be heard, nor shall any word come out of your mouth, until the day I tell you: 'Shout!' Then you shall shout loudly."

(Joshua 6:11) 
So the Ark of the Lord marched around the city once each day, and then returned to the camp and remained there overnight.

(Joshua 6:12) 
Joshua also rose early in the morning, and brought out the priests and the Ark of the Lord. The seven priests carried the seven ram's horn trumpets before the Ark of the Lord.

(Joshua 6:13) 
And the armed men went ahead, and the rest of the multitude followed the procession, and the trumpets sounded continually.

(Joshua 6:14) 
On the second day, they marched around the city once, and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.

(Joshua 6:15) 
And when they rose early on the seventh day, just as dawn was breaking, they marched around the city seven times, as it had been commanded.

(Joshua 6:16) 
And when the priests blew their trumpets loudly on the seventh circuit, Joshua said to all of Israel, "Shout! For the Lord has given you the city."

(Joshua 6:17) 
"This city, and everything in it, shall be completely consecrated to the Lord for destruction—except for Rahab the prostitute, who shall live, along with everyone who is in her house. This is because she hid the messengers whom we sent."

(Joshua 6:18) 
"But as for you, be careful not to take anything from what is consecrated for destruction. If you do, you will become transgressors, bringing sin and trouble upon the entire camp of Israel."

(Joshua 6:19) 
"For all the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord and shall be placed in the Lord's treasury."

(Joshua 6:20) 
So, when all the people shouted and the trumpets sounded, and as soon as the multitude heard the sound of the shout and the trumpets, the walls immediately collapsed. Then, each man went straight up into the city from where he stood, and they captured the city.

(Joshua 6:21) 
And they utterly destroyed everything in the city with the edge of the sword, from man to woman, from infant to elder. They also struck down all the cattle, sheep, and donkeys.

(Joshua 6:22) 
But Joshua said to the two men who had been spies, "Go into the house of that prostitute woman, and bring her out, along with everything that belongs to her, just as you swore to her."

(Joshua 6:23) 
So the young men went in and brought out Rahab, her parents, her relatives, and all those of her family. They placed them outside the camp of Israel.

(Joshua 6:24) 
They then burned the city and everything in it with fire, except for the silver, gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the house of the Lord.

(Joshua 6:25) 
But Joshua allowed Rahab the prostitute, and her father's household, and all that she possessed, to live. She has remained among Israel to this very day, because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to scout out Jericho. At that time, Joshua swore an oath, saying:

(Joshua 6:26) 
"Cursed be the man before the Lord who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. He shall lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son."

(Joshua 6:27) 
So the Lord was with Joshua, and his renown spread throughout all the land.

(Joshua 6:1) 
Now, the city of Jericho had been completely closed off and heavily fortified. This was due to the fear of the Sons of Israel. As a result, no one could enter or exit the city gates.

(Joshua 6:2) 
But the Lord said to Joshua: "Listen closely! I have already given Jericho into your power, along with its king and all of its strongest warriors."

(Joshua 6:3) 
"All of you warriors must march around the city once each day. You must do this for six days."

(Joshua 6:4) 
"And seven priests must carry seven trumpets—the kind used for the Jubilee celebration. On the seventh day, you must march around the city seven times, and the priests must blow their trumpets loudly."

(Joshua 6:5) 
"When the trumpet sounds a long and more urgent blast, and it rings in your ears, then every one of you must shout together with a very loud cry. At that very moment, the city walls will utterly collapse, and each man can then enter the city directly from where he stands."

(Joshua 6:6) 
So Joshua summoned the priests and said to them: "Lift up the Ark of the Covenant. And let seven other priests carry seven Jubilee trumpets ahead of the Lord's Ark."

(Joshua 6:7) 
He also said to the people: "Go now, and march around the city. Let the armed men go ahead of the Lord's Ark."

(Joshua 6:8) 
Therefore, just as Joshua had commanded, the seven priests with the seven trumpets—the type used for the Jubilee celebration—marched forward before the Lord, blowing their trumpets. And the Ark of the Lord's Covenant followed behind them.

(Joshua 6:9) 
The armed men marched ahead of the main army, and the rest of the people followed the Ark. All of them marched together to the sound of the trumpets.

(Joshua 6:10) 
But Joshua had given a specific command to the people, saying: "Do not shout, and do not let anyone hear your voice until I tell you, 'Shout!' Only then are you to raise your voices loudly."

(Joshua 6:11) 
So the Ark of the Lord marched around the city once that day. Then it returned to the camp and remained there for the night.

(Joshua 6:12) 
So Joshua rose early in the morning. He commanded the priests to carry the Ark of the Lord and the seven other priests to carry the seven Jubilee trumpets ahead of the Lord's Ark.

(Joshua 6:13) 
The armed men also marched ahead, and the rest of the people followed the Ark, as the trumpets were continuously blown.

(Joshua 6:14) 
And they marched around the city once on the second day, and then returned to the camp. They did this same thing for six days in total.

(Joshua 6:15) 
But on the seventh day, they rose very early at dawn and marched around the city seven times, just as they had accustomed themselves to do. On that very day, they also ate bread (after the march).

(Joshua 6:16) 
And when the priests blew their trumpets on the seventh circuit, Joshua said to all the people of Israel: "Now, shout! For the Lord has delivered the city into your hands!"

(Joshua 6:17) 
"And this city, along with everything in it, must be utterly devoted to destruction for the Lord. Only Rahab, the prostitute, is to live, along with everyone who is with her in her house. This is because she hid the messengers whom we sent."

(Joshua 6:18) 
"But you, beware that you do not take anything from what is devoted to destruction. If you do, you yourselves will become devoted to destruction, along with the entire camp of Israel, and you will bring trouble upon yourselves."

(Joshua 6:19) 
"All silver and gold, and all vessels of bronze and iron, are to be consecrated to the Lord. They are to be placed in the Lord's treasury."

(Joshua 6:20) 
Therefore, all the people shouted, and as the trumpets sounded, with everyone yelling together, the sound was heard from afar. Immediately, the city walls collapsed, and each man went up directly to the place opposite him, and they took the city.

(Joshua 6:21) 
And they killed everyone who was in the city, from man to woman, from infant to elderly person. They also killed oxen, sheep, and donkeys with the edge of the sword.

(Joshua 6:22) 
But Joshua said to the two men who had been the spies: "Go into the house of the prostitute woman, and bring her out, and all that belongs to her, just as you swore to her."

(Joshua 6:23) 
So the young men went in and brought out Rahab, along with her parents, her brothers, all her relatives, and all their possessions. They then placed them outside the camp of Israel.

(Joshua 6:24) 
But the city itself and everything in it they burned with fire, except for the silver, gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord's house.

(Joshua 6:25) 
However, Joshua allowed Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she possessed to live. And she has remained in Israel even to this very day, because she had hidden the messengers whom he sent to spy out Jericho.

(Joshua 6:26) 
At that time, Joshua made a solemn oath, saying: "Cursed before the Lord be the man who attempts to raise up and rebuild the city of Jericho! He will lay its foundation with his firstborn son, and he will set up its gates with his youngest child."

(Joshua 6:27) 
So the Lord was with Joshua, and his renown was spread throughout all the land.

(Joshua 7:1) 
However, the Israelites committed a serious transgression. They took some of the forbidden things—items that God had commanded to be utterly destroyed or set apart for Him. Achan, the son of Carmi, who was the son of Zabdi, from the clan of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, took some of these forbidden things. Because of this, the Lord became very angry with the Israelites.

(Joshua 7:2) 
Joshua sent some men from Jericho to the city of Ai, which is located near Beth-aven, to the east of the city of Bethel. He commanded them, 'Go and scout out the land around Ai.' The men followed his orders and scouted Ai.

(Joshua 7:3) 
When they returned, they reported to Joshua, 'There’s no need for our entire army to go. Only about two or three thousand men are needed to go up and conquer the city of Ai, because there are very few people there.'

(Joshua 7:4) 
So about three thousand men from the Israelite army went up to Ai. But as soon as they faced the men of Ai, they turned and fled.

(Joshua 7:5) 
Thirty-six of the Israelite men were killed. The men of Ai pursued them from the city gate all the way to Shebarim, striking them down on the slope as they fled. At this, the hearts of the Israelite people melted in fear and became like water, losing all courage.

(Joshua 7:6) 
When Joshua heard what happened, he tore his clothes in grief and fell to the ground on his face before the Ark of the Lord. He remained there until evening, along with all the elders of Israel, and they threw dust on their heads as a sign of mourning and humiliation.

(Joshua 7:7) 
Joshua cried out, 'Oh, Lord God! Why did You bring this people across the Jordan River, only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they could destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan, in the wilderness!'

(Joshua 7:8) 
'My Lord, what can I say now that Israel has turned its back and fled before its enemies?'

(Joshua 7:9) 
'The Canaanites and all the other inhabitants of the land will hear about this defeat. They will surround us and wipe out our name from the face of the earth. What then will You do for Your great Name and reputation?'

(Joshua 7:10) 
The Lord said to Joshua, 'Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate on the ground?'

(Joshua 7:11) 
'Israel has sinned! They have violated My covenant, the solemn agreement I made with them. They have taken some of the forbidden things, stolen them, lied about it, and hidden them among their own possessions.'

(Joshua 7:12) 
'Because of this, the Israelites will not be able to stand against their enemies until the one who is defiled by this wickedness is removed from among you.'

(Joshua 7:13) 
'Get up! Sanctify the people, and tell them, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow.' For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'There are forbidden things in your midst, Israel. You will not be able to stand against your enemies until the one contaminated by this crime is removed from you.''

(Joshua 7:14) 
'In the morning, you must present yourselves by your tribes. The tribe that the Lord indicates by lot will come forward by its clans. The clan that the Lord indicates will come forward by its families. And the family that the Lord indicates will come forward, man by man.'

(Joshua 7:15) 
'The person who is discovered to have committed this crime will be burned with fire, along with everything he owns. This is because he has violated the Lord's covenant and has brought wickedness upon Israel.'

(Joshua 7:16) 
So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel forward by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah was indicated by the Lord.

(Joshua 7:17) 
Then he brought the clans of Judah forward, and the clan of Zerah was indicated. He then brought the families of Zerah forward, man by man, and Zabdi was indicated.

(Joshua 7:18) 
Finally, he brought Zabdi's family forward, man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was indicated.

(Joshua 7:19) 
Joshua said to Achan, 'My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.'

(Joshua 7:20) 
Achan replied to Joshua, saying, 'It is true; I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did.'

(Joshua 7:21) 
'Among the plunder, I saw a beautiful Babylonian cloak, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I desired these things and so I took them. I have hidden them in the ground inside my tent, with the silver buried underneath.'

(Joshua 7:22) 
Joshua immediately sent messengers, and they ran to Achan's tent. They found everything hidden in that very place, including the silver.

(Joshua 7:23) 
They took them out of the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them before the Lord.

(Joshua 7:24) 
Then Joshua, along with all the Israelites, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, sheep, his tent, and all his other possessions. They brought all these to the Valley of Achor.

(Joshua 7:25) 
There, Joshua said, 'Because you have brought trouble upon us, may the Lord bring trouble upon you this very day.' Then all the Israelites stoned him to death. They also burned everything that belonged to him with fire, including his family members and animals, after stoning them.

(Joshua 7:26) 
They raised a large pile of stones over him, which remains to this day. Then the fierce anger of the Lord turned away from them. That is why the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor, meaning 'Valley of Trouble', to this very day.

(Joshua 7:1) 
The people of Israel committed a grave sin regarding the items devoted to God under the ban—those things meant for complete destruction and not for human plunder. Indeed, Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of these devoted items for himself. Because of this act of disobedience, the Lord God’s anger burned against all the people of Israel.

(Joshua 7:2) 
After this, Joshua sent men from Jericho to go to Ai, a city near Beth-Aven, located to the east of the city of Bethel. He commanded them: 'Go and scout out the land.' So, they went and thoroughly explored Ai.

(Joshua 7:3) 
When they returned, they reported to Joshua: 'There is no need for all the people to go up. Only two or three thousand men should go and attack the city, because the enemies there are very few.'

(Joshua 7:4) 
So, about three thousand men from the people went up to Ai. But immediately, they turned their backs and fled from their enemies,

(Joshua 7:5) 
and thirty-six men from Israel were killed. The enemy pursued them from the gate of the city to Shebarim—a place where the ground slopes downwards—and struck them down on the descent. Because of this defeat, the heart of the people of Israel melted away in fear, like water.

(Joshua 7:6) 
When Joshua heard of this, he tore his clothes in grief and threw himself prostrate on the ground before the Ark of the Lord God. He lay there until evening, joined by all the elders of Israel. They also threw dust upon their heads as a sign of mourning and humiliation.

(Joshua 7:7) 
And Joshua cried out: 'Oh, my Lord God, why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan River? Was it only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they could destroy us? If only we had remained in the wilderness on the other side of the Jordan!'

(Joshua 7:8) 
'My Lord, what can I say now that I see Israel turning their backs and fleeing from their enemies?'

(Joshua 7:9) 
'When the Amorites and all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan hear of this defeat, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the face of the earth. What then will You do for Your great name, Lord God?'

(Joshua 7:10) 
Then the Lord God said to Joshua: 'Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate on the ground like this?'

(Joshua 7:11) 
'Israel has sinned! They have violated My covenant, the one I commanded them to keep. They secretly stole from the devoted items—those things under the ban—and then they lied about it and tried to hide it. Yes, they took some of the things that were meant to be completely set apart for Me.'

(Joshua 7:12) 
'Therefore, the people of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; instead, they will flee from them. This is because they themselves have become subject to the ban, by taking what was devoted. I will no longer be with you unless you remove the devoted thing from among you.'

(Joshua 7:13) 
'Get up! Go and sanctify the people for tomorrow. Tell them: "Purify yourselves for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord God of Israel says: 'There is a devoted thing among you, O Israel! You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove from your midst the one who has been defiled by this wicked act.'"'

(Joshua 7:14) 
'In the morning, you must come forward, each of your tribes. Then, the tribe that the Lord God designates by lot must come forward by its clans. The clan chosen by lot must come forward by its households, and the household chosen by lot must come forward man by man.'

(Joshua 7:15) 
'The person who is discovered to be guilty of this wicked act shall be burned with fire, along with everything he owns. This is because he has violated the Lord God's covenant and has committed a horrific crime against Israel.'

(Joshua 7:16) 
So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was designated by lot.

(Joshua 7:17) 
When he brought the clans of Judah forward, the clan of Zerah was designated by lot. And when he brought that clan forward by its households, the household of Zabdi was found.

(Joshua 7:18) 
Then, when he commanded each man in Zabdi’s household to come forward individually, Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was found to be the guilty one.

(Joshua 7:19) 
Joshua then said to Achan: 'My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel and make a confession. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.'

(Joshua 7:20) 
Achan responded to Joshua, saying: 'Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I did: '

(Joshua 7:21) 
'Among the spoils I saw a very beautiful scarlet cloak, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I coveted them, so I took them. I buried them in the ground inside my tent, with the silver hidden underneath.'

(Joshua 7:22) 
So Joshua sent messengers, who ran to Achan’s tent. There, they found everything hidden in that very place, including the silver.

(Joshua 7:23) 
They took the items from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord God.

(Joshua 7:24) 
Then Joshua, along with all the people of Israel, took Achan, son of Zerah, and the silver, the scarlet cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and all his possessions. They led him and everything he owned to the Valley of Achor.

(Joshua 7:25) 
There, Joshua said to Achan: 'Because you have troubled us by your sin, may the Lord God trouble you this very day.' Then all the people of Israel stoned him to death, and everything that belonged to him was burned with fire.

(Joshua 7:26) 
And they piled a great heap of stones over him, which remains to this very day as a memorial. After this, the Lord God's intense anger turned away from the people of Israel. That place has been called the Valley of Achor—meaning 'Trouble'—even to the present day.

(Joshua 8:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, 'Do not be afraid, nor be terrified! Take all your warriors with you, and go up against the city of Ai. Indeed, I have delivered into your hands the king of this city, its people, the city itself, and all its surrounding territory.'

(Joshua 8:2) 
You shall do to the city of Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king. However, this time you may take all the plunder and animals as spoil for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.

(Joshua 8:3) 
So Joshua and all his warriors rose up to march against Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his most valiant men and sent them out during the night.

(Joshua 8:4) 
And he gave them these orders: 'Make sure you hide yourselves in ambush behind the city. Do not move too far from the city itself. Instead, all of you must be ready.'

(Joshua 8:5) 
'My main army, and I along with them, will advance against the city from the front. When the men of Ai come out against us, just as they did before, we will pretend to flee and turn our backs, until we have lured them far away from their city.'

(Joshua 8:6) 
'They will think that we are truly fleeing and will pursue us until we are far from the city. At that very moment, you are to rise up from your ambush and, without any hesitation, enter the city. The Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.'

(Joshua 8:7) 
'And when you have captured it, set it on fire, so that the smoke from the ambush site will be a clear signal to us.'

(Joshua 8:8) 
'And when you have captured the city, set it on fire. Whatever you do, make sure to do it exactly as I have commanded you—for I will be leading you.'

(Joshua 8:9) 
Joshua then sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush, settling themselves between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of the city of Ai. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley with the main army.

(Joshua 8:10) 
Joshua rose early in the morning, reviewed his army, and then, with the elders of Israel, he marched up against the city of Ai, with all the armed forces following him.

(Joshua 8:11) 
When he had arrived and advanced opposite the city, he positioned his forces to the north of the city, with a valley lying between them and Ai.

(Joshua 8:12) 
He had stationed the thirty thousand men in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of that city.

(Joshua 8:13) 
So the main army, which was to the north of the city, was behind Joshua and his battle lines, positioned so that the rear guard of the army touched the western side of Ai, with the valley still between them.

(Joshua 8:14) 
When the citizens of Ai saw this, they swiftly gave orders, and at once, in the very early morning, they marched out of the city and advanced to battle against Israel, the king himself and all the people of the city proceeding to the flat plain. They did not know that the city had been surrounded by an ambush from behind.

(Joshua 8:15) 
Joshua, with all the men of Israel, pretended to flee before them by way of the wilderness path.

(Joshua 8:16) 
But the men of Ai, shouting and encouraging one another, pursued them. As the men of Ai were drawn away from their city, following the pursuers along the road,

(Joshua 8:17) 
no one remained in either the city of Ai or Bethel who did not join the pursuit of Israel. With their cities left open and unguarded, they pursued Joshua.

(Joshua 8:18) 
Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'Stretch out the shield—or javelin—that is in your hand towards the city of Ai, for I will deliver it to you.' When Joshua stretched out his shield—or javelin—towards the city,

(Joshua 8:19) 
the men in ambush, who had been hiding on the western side of the city, immediately entered the city and captured it. Without anyone to stop them, they set the city on fire.

(Joshua 8:20) 
And now the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of their city ascending up towards the sky. They no longer had anywhere to flee, neither this way nor that. Especially when those who had pretended to flee into the wilderness now turned and advanced against them, along with those who had completely overturned the city.

(Joshua 8:21) 
Joshua, and all the men of Israel, seeing that the city had been captured and that smoke was ascending from it, turned around and attacked the men of Ai.

(Joshua 8:22) 
Indeed, those who had captured Ai also came out of the city to meet them, and the men of Ai found themselves trapped, with enemies on both sides, those from the front and those from the rear. So they were struck down, with none of them remaining or escaping.

(Joshua 8:23) 
They also seized the king of the city of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.

(Joshua 8:24) 
So, when all the citizens of Ai who had fled to the plain and into the wilderness were killed, falling by a single sword—meaning a single decisive battle—all the men of Israel returned to Ai and struck down its inhabitants with the edge of the sword.

(Joshua 8:25) 
The total number of those killed on that day, both men and women, was twelve thousand—all the people of the city of Ai.

(Joshua 8:26) 
Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had stretched out holding the shield—or javelin—until all the inhabitants of Ai had been utterly destroyed.

(Joshua 8:27) 
But the livestock and the plunder of the city, the sons of Israel divided among themselves, just as the Lord had commanded Joshua.

(Joshua 8:28) 
The city of Ai, however, was burned to the ground and turned into a permanent desolation, remaining so to this very day.

(Joshua 8:29) 
Its king he also hanged on a gallows until the evening sun. At sunset, Joshua gave the order, and they took his body down from the cross. They threw it into a pit that they had dug near the entrance of the city and raised a great pile of stones over it, which remains there to this very day.

(Joshua 8:30) 
Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.

(Joshua 8:31) 
He built it just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which no iron tool had touched. And upon it, he offered burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.

(Joshua 8:32) 
And there, on those stones, he wrote a copy of the Law of Moses—a reiteration of the Law—which he had written in the presence of the children of Israel.

(Joshua 8:33) 
All the people, including the elders, the leaders, and the judges, stood on both sides of the ark in the presence of the priests of the Levitical lineage who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Both the sojourner and the native-born Israelite were there, with half of them standing near Mount Gerizim and the other half near Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded for the blessing of the people of Israel.

(Joshua 8:34) 
After this, Joshua read all the words of blessing and cursing, and everything else that was written in the book of the Law.

(Joshua 8:35) 
He left nothing unspoken that Moses had commanded, but read all of it in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, the children, and the sojourners who lived among them.

(Joshua 8:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, "Do not be afraid, and do not be terrified. Take with you all your fighting men, and go up against the city of Ai. Behold, I have delivered into your hand the king of this city, along with its people, the city itself, and its land."

(Joshua 8:2) 
You will do to the city of Ai and its king exactly as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may keep the plunder and livestock for yourselves. Now, set an ambush behind the city.

(Joshua 8:3) 
So Joshua rose up, and all the army of fighting men with him, to go up to Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his most courageous warriors and sent them out by night.

(Joshua 8:4) 
He commanded them, saying, "See that you lie in ambush behind the city; do not go too far away from it."

(Joshua 8:5) 
"I and the rest of the army that is with me will approach the city from the front. When they come out against us, just as they did before, we will flee and turn our backs."

(Joshua 8:6) 
"We will keep fleeing until we have drawn them far away from the city. They will think that we are fleeing, just as we did the first time. And when we have fled,"

(Joshua 8:7) 
"you will rise up from your ambush and enter the city without any doubt or hesitation, for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands."

(Joshua 8:8) 
"And when you have captured it, burn the city with fire. Do exactly as I have commanded you. See to it that you do not turn aside to the right or to the left."

(Joshua 8:9) 
So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush, positioning themselves between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city of Ai. Joshua himself remained that night in the midst of the people.

(Joshua 8:10) 
Joshua rose early in the morning and reviewed the army. Then he ascended with the elders at the head of the troops.

(Joshua 8:11) 
When all the fighting men who were with him had come and gone up, they hurried and came opposite the city, taking up position on the north side of the city. There was a valley between them and Ai.

(Joshua 8:12) 
And Joshua had also placed five thousand men in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of that same city.

(Joshua 8:13) 
Now, all the main army that had come to the north of the city, and the remaining men who had been designated for the ambush, marched on and set up their camp to the west of that same city. Joshua, during that night, passed through the middle of the valley, moving undetected.

(Joshua 8:14) 
When the king of Ai saw this, he hurried out early in the morning and went forth with all the army of the city against Israel to battle, at a predetermined time, in the plain. He was entirely unaware that an ambush lay hidden behind the city.

(Joshua 8:15) 
But Joshua and all Israel, feigning flight, turned their backs and headed along the way towards the wilderness.

(Joshua 8:16) 
And the men of Ai, shouting loudly, urged one another to pursue them. In this manner, they drew out all those who were in the city, pursuing the fleeing Israelites.

(Joshua 8:17) 
Not a single man remained in the cities of Ai or Bethel who did not pursue Israel. Leaving their cities open and defenseless, they followed after Joshua.

(Joshua 8:18) 
The Lord then said to Joshua, "Extend the shield or javelin that is in your hand towards the city of Ai, because I will deliver it to you."

(Joshua 8:19) 
And as soon as Joshua extended his hand, those who were lying in ambush immediately rose from their place. They ran and entered the city, captured it, and set it on fire.

(Joshua 8:20) 
The men of the city who were pursuing Joshua looked back and saw the smoke of their city rising towards the sky. They could no longer escape in any direction, especially since those who had feigned flight towards the wilderness now turned and vigorously resisted their pursuers.

(Joshua 8:21) 
So when Joshua and all Israel saw that the city had been captured and that smoke was rising from it, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.

(Joshua 8:22) 
And those who had occupied Ai also came out from the city to meet their own men. Thus, the enemies were trapped and slaughtered in the middle, fighting from both sides, so that not a single one of them was left alive.

(Joshua 8:23) 
They also seized the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.

(Joshua 8:24) 
So all Israel killed the inhabitants of Ai who had been in the fields and in the wilderness to which they had fled. All of them fell by the edge of the sword, until not a single one remained. Then the Israelites returned and struck down the city itself.

(Joshua 8:25) 
And the total number of all those who fell on that day, both men and women, including the inhabitants of the city of Ai itself, was twelve thousand people.

(Joshua 8:26) 
Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had extended while holding the shield or javelin, until all the inhabitants of Ai had been utterly destroyed.

(Joshua 8:27) 
But the rest of the plunder and the livestock of that city Israel divided among themselves, just as the Lord had commanded Joshua.

(Joshua 8:28) 
Joshua then burned the city of Ai, reducing it to a permanent mound of ruins, a desolate place even to this present day.

(Joshua 8:29) 
Its king, he also hung on a gallows until the setting of the sun. When the sun went down, Joshua commanded them, and they took his corpse down from the gallows. It was then thrown at the very entrance of that city's gate, and they piled a great heap of stones over it, which remains there even to this present day.

(Joshua 8:30) 
At that time, Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.

(Joshua 8:31) 
He built it exactly as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which no iron tool had touched. And upon it, he offered burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.

(Joshua 8:32) 
And upon these stones, Joshua wrote a copy of the Law of Moses, the Second Law, which Moses had written in the presence of the children of Israel.

(Joshua 8:33) 
And all the people, including the elders, the leaders, and the judges, stood on both sides of the Ark in the sight of the priests of the Levitical lineage, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Both the foreigners and the native-born Israelites stood, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded them to bless the people of Israel.

(Joshua 8:34) 
After this, Joshua read all the words of the blessing and the curse, and everything else that was written in the book of the Law.

(Joshua 8:35) 
He did not omit anything that Moses had commanded, but recounted everything before the entire congregation of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among the army.

(Joshua 9:1) 
Now, when all these kings heard the news—the kings from across the Jordan, in the mountains and in the plains, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and along the entire shore of the Great Sea—these also, who lived in the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,

(Joshua 9:2) 
they gathered together to fight against Joshua and the people of Israel. They did this with a single purpose and common agreement.

(Joshua 9:3) 
However, the people who lived in Gibeon, when they heard all that Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai—the complete destruction of those cities—

(Joshua 9:4) 
they too began to plot deceitfully. They took old, moldy provisions and loaded them into worn-out sacks onto their donkeys. They also had wine skins that were old, torn, and badly patched up.

(Joshua 9:5) 
They put on very old, worn-out sandals and dressed themselves in extremely old clothing. Even the bread they brought for their journey was dry, crumbly, and reduced to dust.

(Joshua 9:6) 
Then they went to Joshua, at the camp in Gilgal, and said to him and to the leaders of Israel: 'We have come from a very distant land, because we want to make a treaty with you.'

(Joshua 9:7) 
The men of Israel replied to the Gibeonites: 'Perhaps you live in our land. If that were the case, we are forbidden to make a treaty with you.'

(Joshua 9:8) 
But they said to Joshua, 'We are your servants.' Joshua then asked them, 'Who are you, and where have you come from?'

(Joshua 9:9) 
They replied: 'Your servants have come from a very distant land because of the fame of the name of the Lord your God. For we have heard about His great power, and all that He did in Egypt—'

(Joshua 9:10) 
—and everything He did to the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan: namely, Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.

(Joshua 9:11) 
'Therefore, the elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying: "Take provisions for your journey, go to meet them, and say: 'We are your servants; make a treaty with us.'"'

(Joshua 9:12) 
'Look at our bread: it was warm and fresh when we left our homes on the day we set out to come to you. But now, as you can see, it is dry and crumbled into dust.'

(Joshua 9:13) 
'These wineskins also were new when we filled them, but now they are torn and split. And these clothes and sandals, which we are wearing and on our feet, are almost completely worn out because of the exceedingly long journey.'

(Joshua 9:14) 
So the men of Israel accepted their provisions and were convinced by their story. However, they did not consult the Lord for guidance.

(Joshua 9:15) 
Joshua then made peace with them, entering into a treaty and promising that they would be allowed to live. The leaders of the community also swore an oath to them.

(Joshua 9:16) 
However, three days after the treaty was made, the Israelites heard that the Gibeonites were actually living nearby, and that they were inhabitants of their very own land.

(Joshua 9:17) 
So the sons of Israel moved their camp and, on the third day, arrived at the Gibeonites' cities. These were the names of their cities: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

(Joshua 9:18) 
The sons of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, making it a sacred and binding promise. Therefore, the entire community grumbled and complained against their leaders.

(Joshua 9:19) 
The leaders replied to them: 'We have sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we cannot touch them to harm them.'

(Joshua 9:20) 
'But this is what we will do to them: we will let them live and preserve their lives, lest the Lord become angry with us and punish us for breaking the oath we swore.'

(Joshua 9:21) 
The leaders then said: 'They will live, but they will be assigned to cut wood and draw water for the service of the entire community.' And what the leaders said, so it was done.

(Joshua 9:22) 
Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said to them: 'Why did you want to deceive us by saying, "We live far from you," when you actually live right in our midst?'

(Joshua 9:23) 
'Therefore, you will be under a curse, and your descendants will never cease to be woodcutters and water-drawers for the house of my God, the sanctuary of the Lord.'

(Joshua 9:24) 
They replied to Joshua, and said: 'It was clearly revealed to your servants that the Lord your God intended to hand over the entire land and all its inhabitants to you, wherever you went. Therefore, we were greatly afraid, and acting to save our lives, we did this.'

(Joshua 9:25) 
'Now behold, we are in your hand. Do to us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.'

(Joshua 9:26) 
So Joshua did as he had declared, and he delivered them from the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they were not killed.

(Joshua 9:27) 
On that very day, Joshua appointed them to be woodcutters and water-drawers for the needs of the entire community and for the altar of the Lord, a service that continues even to this present day, in the place that the Lord would choose for His dwelling.

(Joshua 9:1) 
But when all the kings across the Jordan River heard of these things—those who lived in the hill country, in the plains, and along the coastal parts of Greater Syria and Phoenicia, that is, those near the Great Sea—the Mediterranean Sea—and those beyond the Euphrates River, including the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—

(Joshua 9:2) 
they all gathered together, united in mind and purpose, to fight against Joshua and the people of Israel.

(Joshua 9:3) 
However, the people who lived in Gibeon, having heard everything that Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,

(Joshua 9:4) 
they too resorted to trickery. They took old, worn-out provisions, torn and mended sacks for their donkeys, and very old, patched-up sandals on their feet.

(Joshua 9:5) 
They were also dressed in old garments, and the bread they carried for their journey was hard and crumbled into dust.

(Joshua 9:6) 
They came to Joshua, who was then staying in Gilgal, and said to him, and to all the Israelites assembled, "We have come from a distant land. We earnestly ask you to make a covenant with us."

(Joshua 9:7) 
The men of Israel answered the Gibeonites and said, "Perhaps you live in our land, and in that case, we cannot make a covenant with you."

(Joshua 9:8) 
But they said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua asked them, "Who are you, then, and where have you come from?"

(Joshua 9:9) 
They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant land because of the fame of the Lord your God. For we have heard of His mighty power, all that He did in Egypt,"

(Joshua 9:10) 
"and to the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan River: Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth."

(Joshua 9:11) 
"Therefore, our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, saying: 'Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say: "We are your servants; make a covenant with us."'"

(Joshua 9:12) 
"See, this bread, which we took warm from our homes when we set out to come to you, is now dry and crumbled into dust."

(Joshua 9:13) 
"These wineskins, which we filled, were new, but now they are torn and mended. These garments and sandals which we are wearing on our feet are worn out from the very long journey."

(Joshua 9:14) 
So the men of Israel accepted their provisions but did not consult the word of the Lord.

(Joshua 9:15) 
Joshua then made peace with them and struck a covenant to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly swore an oath to it.

(Joshua 9:16) 
However, three days after the covenant was made, they heard that the Gibeonites were actually nearby and lived right in the midst of their region.

(Joshua 9:17) 
So the children of Israel broke camp and came to their cities on the third day. These were their names: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

(Joshua 9:18) 
But the children of Israel did not strike them down, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Therefore, the entire army grumbled against the leaders.

(Joshua 9:19) 
The leaders answered them, saying, "We have sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we cannot touch them."

(Joshua 9:20) 
"But we will do this for them: let them live, but they will eternally serve the entire assembly by cutting wood and carrying water."

(Joshua 9:21) 
So the leaders spoke concerning the Gibeonites, that they should live, and as the leaders had said, they should cut wood and carry water for the entire assembly.

(Joshua 9:22) 
Then Joshua called them and spoke to them, saying, "Why did you want to deceive us, by saying, 'We live very far away from you,' when in fact you are right in our midst?"

(Joshua 9:23) 
"Therefore, you will be cursed, and there will never cease from your descendants those who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."

(Joshua 9:24) 
They answered Joshua and said, "We were very afraid that you would take our lives from us, because of this we did this thing. For we heard that the Lord your God had commanded His servant Moses to destroy all the inhabitants of the land with you."

(Joshua 9:25) 
"Now therefore, we are in your hand. Whatever seems right and good to you, do to us."

(Joshua 9:26) 
So Joshua did to them as he had spoken, and he delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, so that they were not killed.

(Joshua 9:27) 
Nevertheless, on that day, he appointed them to be woodcutters and water carriers for the use of all the people and for the altar of the Lord, right up to the present day, in the place which God would choose.

(Joshua 10:1) 
When Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard the news that Joshua had taken Ai and utterly destroyed it—repeating the same total destruction he had brought upon Jericho and its king for Ai and its king—he also heard that the Gibeonites had willingly surrendered to Israel and entered into a peace treaty with them.

(Joshua 10:2) 
They feared greatly, for Gibeon was a large city, one counted among the royal cities, and it was even greater than the town of Ai. All of its men were very strong warriors.

(Joshua 10:3) 
So Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent messengers to Hoham, the king of Hebron; to Piram, the king of Jarmuth; to Japhia, the king of Lachish; and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying this:

(Joshua 10:4) 
“Come to me and provide military aid, so that we may attack Gibeon, because they have willingly surrendered to Joshua and the sons of Israel.”

(Joshua 10:5) 
So these five kings of the Amorites gathered together—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon—and they marched with their armies. They set up camp around Gibeon and began to besiege it.

(Joshua 10:6) 
The inhabitants of Gibeon then sent a message to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not withdraw your help from your servants! Come up quickly and deliver us; bring us military aid, for all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country have gathered against us.”

(Joshua 10:7) 
So Joshua went up from Gilgal, and the entire army of very strong men went with him, along with all his robust warriors.

(Joshua 10:8) 
The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, “Do not fear them. For I have delivered them into your hands; none of them will be able to resist you in battle.”

(Joshua 10:9) 
Joshua marched up from Gilgal throughout the entire night, and he unexpectedly attacked them at dawn.

(Joshua 10:10) 
The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and Joshua struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon. He then pursued them along the road that ascends to Beth-Horon, and continued the chase as far as Azekah and Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:11) 
As they fled from the sons of Israel and were on the descent from Beth-Horon, the Lord sent large hailstones down on them from the sky all the way to Azekah. Many more of them died from these hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel struck down with the sword.

(Joshua 10:12) 
Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when God delivered the Amorites into the hand of Israel. He said publicly, in the sight of all Israel, “Sun, do not move from your position over Gibeon! And Moon, do not move from your position over the Valley of Ajalon!”

(Joshua 10:13) 
The sun stood still, and the moon remained in its place, until the nation of Israel had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? The sun stood in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to set for about an entire day.

(Joshua 10:14) 
Neither before nor since has there been such a long day, for the Lord obeyed the voice of a man, and the Lord fought on behalf of Israel.

(Joshua 10:15) 
Joshua then returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.

(Joshua 10:16) 
Meanwhile, the five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave near the city of Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:17) 
It was reported to Joshua that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave near the city of Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:18) 
Joshua gave orders, saying, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and place men over them to guard them.”

(Joshua 10:19) 
He continued, “But you are not to stand still! Instead, pursue the enemies and strike down their rear guard. Do not allow any of them to re-enter the cities to which they were fleeing, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands.”

(Joshua 10:20) 
Consequently, nearly all of the enemy were cut down, and only a very small number escaped, making it into fortified cities.

(Joshua 10:21) 
Then the entire army returned to Joshua at Makkedah, safe and sound. No one dared to utter a word against the sons of Israel.

(Joshua 10:22) 
Joshua then commanded, saying, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.”

(Joshua 10:23) 
So they did as he commanded and brought the five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

(Joshua 10:24) 
When the kings had been brought out, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the army who were with him, “Come forward and place your feet upon the necks of these kings.” When they had come forward and placed their feet on their necks,

(Joshua 10:25) 
Joshua said to them again, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous! For in this very way, the Lord will treat all your enemies against whom you fight.”

(Joshua 10:26) 
Joshua then struck them down and killed them, hanging their bodies on four separate trees. They hung there until the evening.

(Joshua 10:27) 
When the sun was setting, Joshua gave the order, and they took their bodies down from the stakes. They then threw them into the cave where they had hidden, and they placed enormous stones over its mouth, which remain there to this very day.

(Joshua 10:28) 
On that very day, Joshua captured Makkedah. He struck the city with the edge of the sword, killing its king and all the people in it, leaving no survivors. He treated the king of Makkedah just as he had treated the king of Jericho.

(Joshua 10:29) 
Joshua then marched with all Israel from Makkedah to Libnah, and he attacked it.

(Joshua 10:30) 
The Lord also delivered Libnah and its king into the hand of Israel. Joshua struck the city with the edge of the sword, and every living soul who resided in it, leaving no survivors there. They treated the king of Libnah just as they had treated the king of Jericho.

(Joshua 10:31) 
From Libnah, Joshua passed on to Lachish with all Israel. They encamped around it and attacked it.

(Joshua 10:32) 
The Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and they captured it on the second day. Joshua struck every living soul who had been in it with the edge of the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.

(Joshua 10:33) 
At that very time, Hoham, the king of Gezer, came up to provide aid to Lachish. But Joshua struck him and all his people until not one survivor remained.

(Joshua 10:34) 
Joshua then moved from Lachish to Eglon, passing through with all Israel. He besieged the city and fought against it.

(Joshua 10:35) 
He captured it on the same day and struck all who were in it with the edge of the sword, killing every living soul, just as he had done to Lachish.

(Joshua 10:36) 
Joshua also went up from Eglon to Hebron with all Israel and fought against it.

(Joshua 10:37) 
He captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, along with its king, all its towns in that region, and every living soul who was in it. He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Eglon, so he did to Hebron, utterly destroying everything he found within it.

(Joshua 10:38) 
Then Joshua returned to Debir, captured it, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He also killed its king, all the surrounding towns, and every living soul who was in it.

(Joshua 10:39) 
He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Hebron and Libnah and their kings, so he did to Debir and its king.

(Joshua 10:40) 
So Joshua struck down all the land of the hill country, the Negeb in the south, the lowland, and the slopes, along with all their kings. He left no survivors in any of it, but utterly destroyed everything that could breathe, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.

(Joshua 10:1) 
When Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and utterly destroyed it—he had done the same to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the Gibeonites had willingly surrendered to Israel and were now allied with them:

(Joshua 10:2) 
he feared greatly, especially because the city of Gibeon was a great city, counted among the royal cities, larger than the town of Ai, and all its men were very strong warriors.

(Joshua 10:3) 
So Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent messengers to Hoham, the king of Hebron, and to Piram, the king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, the king of Lachish, and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying:

(Joshua 10:4) 
“Come to me and bring your forces, so that we may attack Gibeon. For it has surrendered to Joshua and the children of Israel.”

(Joshua 10:5) 
So, having been called together, the five kings of the Amorites went: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. They, along with all their armies, went up and encamped around Gibeon, attacking it.

(Joshua 10:6) 
And the inhabitants of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua, who at that time was staying at Gilgal, and they said to him: “Do not withdraw your aid from your servants. Come up quickly and deliver us, and bring us help, because all the kings of the Amorites who live in the mountains have gathered against us.”

(Joshua 10:7) 
So Joshua went up from Gilgal, and the entire army of warriors with him, including all his strongest men.

(Joshua 10:8) 
And the Lord said to Joshua: “Do not fear them. For I have delivered them into your hands, and none of them will be able to resist you.”

(Joshua 10:9) 
So Joshua suddenly attacked them, having marched all night from Gilgal.

(Joshua 10:10) 
And the Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and crushed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon. And Israel pursued them by the way leading up to Beth-horon, striking them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:11) 
And as they were fleeing from Israel and were on the descent of Beth-horon, the Lord sent large hailstones down upon them from the sky all the way to Azekah. Many more died from the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel had killed with the sword.

(Joshua 10:12) 
Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered the Amorites into the sight of the children of Israel. He said in the sight of all the people: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.”

(Joshua 10:13) 
And the sun stood still and the moon stopped, until the nation had taken vengeance on its enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? So the sun stood still in the middle of the sky, and it did not hasten to set for a whole day.

(Joshua 10:14) 
There has not been a day so long, before or since, when the Lord obeyed the voice of a man and fought for Israel.

(Joshua 10:15) 
Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, returned to the camp at Gilgal.

(Joshua 10:16) 
For the five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave near the city of Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:17) 
And it was reported to Joshua that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave near the city of Makkedah.

(Joshua 10:18) 
He commanded and said: “Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and station men over them to guard them carefully.”

(Joshua 10:19) 
“But you, do not stand still. Instead, pursue your enemies and strike down all the stragglers of their fleeing army. Do not allow them to enter the protection of their cities, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands.”

(Joshua 10:20) 
So, after such a great slaughter of their enemies, and almost completely destroying them—meaning those who had been able to escape and enter fortified cities—

(Joshua 10:21) 
the entire army returned to Joshua at Makkedah, safe and sound. No one dared to utter a word against the children of Israel.

(Joshua 10:22) 
And Joshua said: “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out the five kings from the cave to me.”

(Joshua 10:23) 
And they did so. They brought out the five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

(Joshua 10:24) 
And when they were brought out, Joshua called all the men of Israel, and he said to the commanders of the army and the leaders of the warriors who were with him: “Come forward and place your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and stepped on their necks.

(Joshua 10:25) 
Again he said to them: “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and be firm, for the Lord will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”

(Joshua 10:26) 
And Joshua struck them and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. They remained hanging until evening.

(Joshua 10:27) 
And when the sun was setting, Joshua commanded them to take them down from the gallows. So they took them down and threw them into the cave where they had hidden, and they placed large stones over its mouth, which remain there to this very day.

(Joshua 10:28) 
On that same day, Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it down with the edge of the sword. He killed its king and all its inhabitants, leaving no survivors in it. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

(Joshua 10:29) 
Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against it.

(Joshua 10:30) 
The Lord delivered it, along with its king, into the hands of Israel. Joshua struck the city with the edge of the sword, and all its inhabitants. He left no survivors in it, and he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

(Joshua 10:31) 
From there, Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Libnah to Lachish. Having arranged his army all around it, he attacked it.

(Joshua 10:32) 
And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel. Joshua captured it on the second day and struck it down with the edge of the sword, killing everyone in it, just as he had done to Libnah.

(Joshua 10:33) 
At that time, Horam, the king of Gezer, came up to bring aid to Lachish. Joshua struck him and all his people until not one was left alive.

(Joshua 10:34) 
Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachish to Eglon. They surrounded it and attacked it.

(Joshua 10:35) 
He captured it on that same day and struck down with the edge of the sword everyone who was in it, in the same manner as the slaughter he had carried out in Libnah.

(Joshua 10:36) 
Joshua also went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and he fought against it.

(Joshua 10:37) 
He captured it and struck it down with the edge of the sword. He also struck down its king and all the cities of that region, and all its inhabitants. He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Eglon, so he did to Hebron and to all its surrounding towns.

(Joshua 10:38) 
Returning from there, Joshua, and all Israel with him, went to Debir and fought against it.

(Joshua 10:39) 
He captured it and utterly destroyed it, killing every living soul that was in it. He left no survivors there. Just as he had done to Hebron and Libnah, so he did to Debir and its king.

(Joshua 10:40) 
So Joshua struck down all the mountainous land, and the southern region, and the lowlands, and the slopes of the mountains, along with all their kings. He left no survivors in it, but killed everything that breathed, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.

(Joshua 11:1) 
When Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard what had happened, he sent messengers to Jobab, the king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph.

(Joshua 11:2) 
He also sent to the kings in the northern mountainous regions, and in the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the lowlands, and in the region of Dor, which is by the sea.

(Joshua 11:3) 
He also sent to the Canaanites in the east and west, and to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites who lived in the mountainous areas, and to the Hivites who lived below Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

(Joshua 11:4) 
So all these kings went out with their armies; a great many people, as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with an endless multitude of horses and chariots.

(Joshua 11:5) 
They gathered together and came as one, and they camped by the waters of Merom to fight against the people of Israel.

(Joshua 11:6) 
And the Lord said to Joshua: "Do not be afraid of them, because tomorrow at this very hour, I will hand all these people over, defeated, into the presence of Israel. You will hamstring their horses, rendering them useless, and burn their chariots with fire."

(Joshua 11:7) 
So Joshua and all his army came upon them suddenly at the waters of Merom and attacked them.

(Joshua 11:8) 
The Lord handed them over into the power of Israel, who struck them down and pursued all of them as far as Great Sidon, and to Misrephoth-Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east. They drove them away and struck them down until there was no one left alive.

(Joshua 11:9) 
And Joshua did exactly as the Lord had commanded: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

(Joshua 11:10) 
At that time, Joshua returned and captured Hazor and killed its king with the sword, because Hazor had historically held the chief authority among all these kingdoms.

(Joshua 11:11) 
And he struck down every living soul who resided there, utterly destroying them. He left no survivors in Hazor, but utterly devastated everything until it was desolate.

(Joshua 11:12) 
Joshua also captured all the other cities of these kings and their kings themselves, striking them down with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded him.

(Joshua 11:13) 
However, Joshua did not burn down any of the cities located on hills or mounds, except for Hazor alone, which he had burned down because it was a very heavily fortified city.

(Joshua 11:14) 
But all the plunder from these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel divided among themselves. They did not leave any person alive from all those they were able to capture.

(Joshua 11:15) 
Just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded Joshua, so Joshua completely fulfilled everything. He did not omit a single word from all the commands that the Lord had given to Moses.

(Joshua 11:16) 
So Joshua took control of all the mountain country, and all the Negeb region in the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the western region, and the mountainous country of Israel, and its lowlands.

(Joshua 11:17) 
He took the land from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down, and killed them.

(Joshua 11:18) 
Joshua fought against these kings for a long time.

(Joshua 11:19) 
There was not a single city that surrendered to the sons of Israel, except for the Hivites who lived in Gibeon. Joshua captured all the rest through warfare.

(Joshua 11:20) 
For it was the Lord's will to harden their hearts so that they would fight against Israel and fall, and not deserve any mercy, and perish, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Joshua 11:21) 
At that time, Joshua came and wiped out the Anakim from the mountainous regions of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the mountain country of Judah and Israel. He utterly destroyed their cities.

(Joshua 11:22) 
There were no Anakim left alive in the land of the sons of Israel, except in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod, where some survivors remained.

(Joshua 11:23) 
So Joshua took possession of all the land, just as the Lord had promised to Moses. He gave it as an inheritance to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions and their tribes. And then the land had rest from the battles.

(Joshua 11:1) 
After hearing all these things, King Jabin of Hazor sent messengers to King Jobab of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph;

(Joshua 11:2) 
He also sent to the kings of the northern regions, who held the nearby territories: to the mountain dwellers and those who lived in the plains south of Chinnereth (which is the Sea of Galilee), and to the Samarites and the Nafeth Dor who lived along the coastal region.

(Joshua 11:3) 
He sent also to the Canaanites in the east and west, and to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the mountains; and to the Hivites who lived under Mount Hermon, in the land of Mizpah.

(Joshua 11:4) 
So they all came out with their armies—a vast multitude of people, as numerous as the sand on the seashore; and their horses and chariots were beyond counting.

(Joshua 11:5) 
And gathering together, they encamped by the waters of Merom, so that they could fight against Israel.

(Joshua 11:6) 
Then the Lord said to Joshua: 'Do not be afraid of them, because at this time tomorrow, I will deliver all these people to be wounded before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.'

(Joshua 11:7) 
So Joshua and all his army came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they rushed upon them.

(Joshua 11:8) 
And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them as far as Great Sidon, and to the waters of Misrephoth, and to the valley of Mizpah to the east. All of them fell, with no one left remaining.

(Joshua 11:9) 
And Joshua did just as the Lord had commanded: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

(Joshua 11:10) 
Then, immediately returning, he captured Hazor and put its king to death with the sword. For Hazor in ancient times was the capital city of all these kingdoms.

(Joshua 11:11) 
And he struck down every living person who lived there with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; no soul remained alive, but all were consumed. And he burned Hazor itself with fire.

(Joshua 11:12) 
Joshua captured all those cities and their kings, and struck them down with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed them, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded him.

(Joshua 11:13) 
However, Israel did not fight to overthrow the cities that were situated on hills and mounds; only Hazor did Joshua burn down.

(Joshua 11:14) 
And all the plunder of these cities, and the livestock, the sons of Israel divided among themselves. They killed all the people, leaving no one breathing.

(Joshua 11:15) 
Just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded him, so Joshua carried out everything. He omitted nothing of what had been commanded to him.

(Joshua 11:16) 
So Joshua took all the mountain land, and the southern land, and the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the western region; and the mountain of Israel, and its plains,

(Joshua 11:17) 
from Mount Halak, which ascends to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down, and put them to death.

(Joshua 11:18) 
For a long time Joshua fought against these kings.

(Joshua 11:19) 
There was not one city that surrendered to the sons of Israel, except for the Hivites who lived in Gibeon; for Joshua captured all of them by war.

(Joshua 11:20) 
For it was the Lord's decision to harden their hearts, so that they would fight against Israel, and fall, and not deserve any mercy, but perish, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Joshua 11:21) 
At that time Joshua came and utterly destroyed the Anakim from the mountains—from Hebron, and from Debir, and from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah and Israel. He also destroyed their cities.

(Joshua 11:22) 
He left none of the Anakim stock in the land of the sons of Israel, except for a small remnant in Gaza, and in Ashdod, and in Gath.

(Joshua 11:23) 
So Joshua took all the land, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses, and he gave it as a possession to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from war.

(Joshua 12:1) 
These are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated. They took possession of their land on the other side of the Jordan River, to the east, stretching from the Arnon ravine all the way to Mount Hermon, encompassing the entire eastern plain.

(Joshua 12:2) 
Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, ruled from Aroer, which is situated on the bank of the Arnon ravine, including the middle section of the ravine itself, and half of Gilead, extending all the way to the Jabbok ravine, which marks the boundary of the sons of Ammon.

(Joshua 12:3) 
His territory also extended from the desert all the way to the Sea of Chinneroth—the Sea of Galilee—on its eastern side, and south to the Dead Sea, which is the Salt Sea, along the eastern route that leads to Beth Jeshimoth, and from the southern part below the slopes of Pisgah.

(Joshua 12:4) 
The boundaries of Og, king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaim giants, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei, stretched from Mount Hermon and Salecah, and included all of Bashan, extending to the borders of Geshur and Maachath, as well as half of Gilead, which was the territory of Sihon, king of Heshbon.

(Joshua 12:5) 
Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the sons of Israel defeated these kings. And Moses divided their land as a possession for the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and for half of the tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 12:6) 
These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated on the western side of the Jordan River. Their territory stretched from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon, all the way to Mount Halak, whose slopes rise toward Seir. Joshua then gave this land as a possession to the tribes of Israel, each tribe receiving its portion.

(Joshua 12:7) 
This land included the hill country, the plains, the western foothills, the desert, and the Negeb—the southern region. It was the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

(Joshua 12:8) 
The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;

(Joshua 12:9) 
the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

(Joshua 12:10) 
the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

(Joshua 12:11) 
the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

(Joshua 12:12) 
the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

(Joshua 12:13) 
the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

(Joshua 12:14) 
the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

(Joshua 12:15) 
the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

(Joshua 12:16) 
the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

(Joshua 12:17) 
the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

(Joshua 12:18) 
the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

(Joshua 12:19) 
the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

(Joshua 12:20) 
the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

(Joshua 12:21) 
the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;

(Joshua 12:22) 
the king of Dor, and of the region of Dor, one;

(Joshua 12:23) 
the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; the king of Tirzah, one.

(Joshua 12:24) 
All these kings total thirty-one.

(Joshua 12:1) 
These are the kings of the land whom the people of Israel defeated and whose land they took possession of. This was the territory east of the Jordan River, stretching from the Arnon stream all the way to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern plains that lead into the desert.

(Joshua 12:2) 
One of them was Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon. His dominion extended from Aroer, which lies on the bank of the Arnon stream, through the middle of that stream's valley, and half of Gilead, up to the Jabbok stream, which served as the boundary for the Ammonites.

(Joshua 12:3) 
His territory also stretched from the desert to the Sea of Chinnereth in the east, and to the Sea of the Desert—which is the Salt Sea—on the eastern side, along the road that leads to Beth Jeshimoth. On the southern side, his border extended below the slopes of Pisgah.

(Joshua 12:4) 
The territory of Og, king of Bashan, was also conquered. He was one of the last of the Rephaim giants who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all of Bashan, extending to the borders of Geshur and Maachath.

(Joshua 12:5) 
His dominion also included half of Gilead, up to the border of Sihon, king of Heshbon. Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the people of Israel defeated these kings. Moses, the Lord's servant, then gave their land as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 12:6) 
These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the people of Israel defeated west of the Jordan River. Their territory stretched from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon all the way to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave this land as a possession to the tribes of Israel, assigning each tribe its own portion.

(Joshua 12:7) 
This distribution included lands in the mountainous regions, the western foothills, the plains, the southern desert, and the Arabah valley.

(Joshua 12:8) 
The people who inhabited these lands included the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

(Joshua 12:9) 
The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;

(Joshua 12:10) 
the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

(Joshua 12:11) 
the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

(Joshua 12:12) 
the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

(Joshua 12:13) 
the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

(Joshua 12:14) 
the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

(Joshua 12:15) 
the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

(Joshua 12:16) 
the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

(Joshua 12:17) 
the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

(Joshua 12:18) 
the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

(Joshua 12:19) 
the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

(Joshua 12:20) 
the king of Shimron-Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

(Joshua 12:21) 
the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

(Joshua 12:22) 
the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;

(Joshua 12:23) 
the king of Dor, and its region, one; the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one;

(Joshua 12:24) 
the king of Tirzah, one. In total, these are thirty-one kings.

(Joshua 13:1) 
Joshua had grown old and was very advanced in years. And the Lord said to him, "You are old, and very advanced in years, yet a vast territory remains which has not yet been divided among the tribes."

(Joshua 13:2) 
This is the territory that remains to be conquered: all the regions of the Philistines, and all of Geshur.

(Joshua 13:3) 
It extends from the Shihor River, which is near Egypt, all the way to the northern border of Ekron. This is the land of the Canaanites, which is ruled by five Philistine lords: the leaders of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. It also includes the Hivites in the south.

(Joshua 13:4) 
And from the south, all the land of Canaan, from Mearah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the territory of the Amorites.

(Joshua 13:5) 
And the land of Gebal, and all of Lebanon to the east, from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon, all the way to the entrance of Hamath.

(Joshua 13:6) 
All who live in the mountainous region from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians—I will indeed drive them out from before the Israelites. You are to distribute this land by lot to the Israelites, just as I commanded you, even though it is not yet fully conquered.

(Joshua 13:7) 
Therefore, you are to divide this land as an inheritance for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 13:8) 
(It is with these tribes that) Reuben and Gad, and the other half-tribe of Manasseh, received their territory east of the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had already given to them.

(Joshua 13:9) 
Their territory began from Aroer, which is on the bank of the Arnon Gorge, and from the city in the middle of that valley, encompassing all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon.

(Joshua 13:10) 
It included all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, extending all the way to the border of the Ammonites.

(Joshua 13:11) 
It also included Gilead, the territory of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah.

(Joshua 13:12) 
This was the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He was one of the last of the Rephaim giants. Moses had defeated them and completely destroyed them.

(Joshua 13:13) 
However, the Israelites did not drive out the inhabitants of Geshur and Maacah. Instead, they have lived among Israel to this very day.

(Joshua 13:14) 
But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give any territorial inheritance. Instead, the sacrifices and offerings made to the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, just as He had commanded them through Moses.

(Joshua 13:15) 
So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben, according to their clans.

(Joshua 13:16) 
Their territory extended from Aroer, located on the bank of the Arnon Gorge, including the city in the middle of the valley and all the plain leading to Medeba.

(Joshua 13:17) 
It included Heshbon and all its associated towns in the plains, along with Dibon, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon.

(Joshua 13:18) 
Also Jahaz, Kedemoth, and Mephaath.

(Joshua 13:19) 
And Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley.

(Joshua 13:20) 
Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth.

(Joshua 13:21) 
This included all the cities of the plain, and the entire kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon. Moses had defeated Sihon and also killed the Midianite princes: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were the leaders allied with Sihon and living in that land.

(Joshua 13:22) 
The Israelites also killed Balaam, the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword, along with all the others who were slain.

(Joshua 13:23) 
The Jordan River formed the western border for the descendants of Reuben. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites according to their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 13:24) 
Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, according to their clans.

(Joshua 13:25) 
Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, as far as Aroer, which is opposite Rabbah.

(Joshua 13:26) 
It also extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir.

(Joshua 13:27) 
And in the valley, their cities included Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, which comprised the remaining portion of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The Jordan River was its western border, extending to the furthest point of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the east side of the Jordan.

(Joshua 13:28) 
This was the inheritance of the Gadites, according to their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 13:29) 
Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh, according to their clans.

(Joshua 13:30) 
Their territory extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, all the kingdoms of Og king of Bashan, and all the sixty towns of Jair that are in Bashan.

(Joshua 13:31) 
It also included half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan. This was given to the children of Machir, son of Manasseh, specifically to the half of the Machirites according to their clans.

(Joshua 13:32) 
These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan, across from Jericho.

(Joshua 13:33) 
But to the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no territorial inheritance. For the Lord, the God of Israel, Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as He had promised them.

(Joshua 13:1) 
Joshua had indeed grown very old and was advanced in age. The Lord then spoke to him, saying: “You have indeed become old and very advanced in age, and there remains a vast, extensive land that has not yet been divided among the tribes.”

(Joshua 13:2) 
This is the remaining territory: specifically all of Galilee, the entire land of the Philistines, and Geshur,

(Joshua 13:3) 
Starting from the Nile River, which irrigates Egypt, stretching all the way to the border of Ekron towards the north. This is the land of Canaan, which is controlled by the five lords of the Philistines—specifically the lords of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron—and also the Hivites, who were also within this territory.

(Joshua 13:4) 
Also, from the south, all the rest of the land of Canaan, from Maarah of the Sidonians, stretching all the way to Aphekah and the territory of the Amorites.

(Joshua 13:5) 
And the land of the Gethrites, and all of Lebanon, reaching up to the waters of Misrephoth, and all of Misrephoth, and up to the land of the Sidonians.

(Joshua 13:6) 
All those who live in the mountains, from Lebanon up to the waters of Misrephoth, and all the Sidonians: I Myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel. Your task, Joshua, is only to distribute this land by lot to Israel, just as I have commanded you.

(Joshua 13:7) 
Therefore, you must now divide this land into portions as an inheritance for the nine tribes of Israel, and for the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 13:8) 
The other half of Manasseh, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad, had already taken possession of the territory that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them on the eastern side of the Jordan River.

(Joshua 13:9) 
Their territory began from Aroer, which is located on the bank of the Arnon River, and included the city itself in the middle of the valley, and the entire plain of Medeba, stretching as far as Dibon.

(Joshua 13:10) 
It included all the cities of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and extended up to the borders of the Ammonites.

(Joshua 13:11) 
Their land also included Gilead, and the territories of Geshur and Maachah, and the entire Mount Hermon region, and all of Bashan, reaching to Salecah.

(Joshua 13:12) 
It encompassed all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he was one of the last of the Rephaim giants. Moses had defeated them and utterly destroyed them.

(Joshua 13:13) 
However, the people of Israel did not completely drive out the Geshurites and Maachathites, but instead, they lived among Israel, and their descendants remain to this very day.

(Joshua 13:14) 
But to the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no territorial inheritance, no land portion. Instead, the offerings by fire and sacrifices made to the Lord God of Israel are their inheritance, as the Lord Himself spoke to Moses.

(Joshua 13:15) 
So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 13:16) 
Their territory began from Aroer, which is situated on the bank of the Arnon River, and included the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain that extends towards Medeba.

(Joshua 13:17) 
It included Heshbon and all its cities that are in the plain: Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and the city of Beth-Baal-Meon,

(Joshua 13:18) 
and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

(Joshua 13:19) 
and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-Shahar on the hill of the valley.

(Joshua 13:20) 
It also included Beth-Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-Jesimoth,

(Joshua 13:21) 
all the cities of the plain, and the entire kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, the ruler who reigned in Heshbon. Moses had defeated him along with the chieftains of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—these were the commanders of Sihon, who lived in that territory.

(Joshua 13:22) 
The people of Israel also put Balaam, the son of Beor, the diviner, to death with the sword, along with the others who were slain.

(Joshua 13:23) 
And the Jordan River formed the boundary of Reuben's territory. This is the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their family clans, including all their cities and villages.

(Joshua 13:24) 
Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 13:25) 
Their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half of the land of the Ammonites, up to Aroer, which is opposite Rabbah.

(Joshua 13:26) 
It extended from Heshbon to Ramath-Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the borders of Debir.

(Joshua 13:27) 
And in the valley: Beth-Haram, Beth-Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, which comprised the remaining part of the kingdom of Sihon, the king of Heshbon. The Jordan River was its boundary, extending to the end of the Sea of Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee), on the eastern side of the Jordan.

(Joshua 13:28) 
This is the inheritance of the people of Gad, according to their family clans, including all their cities and villages.

(Joshua 13:29) 
Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 13:30) 
Their territory began from Mahanaim, and included all of Bashan, and the entire kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, and all the sixty towns of Jair which are in Bashan.

(Joshua 13:31) 
It also included half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were given to the people of Machir, the son of Manasseh, to the half of the people of Machir, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 13:32) 
These are the portions that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side.

(Joshua 13:33) 
However, Moses gave no territorial inheritance to the tribe of Levi. For the Lord God of Israel Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as He had spoken to Moses.

(Joshua 14:1) 
This is the full record of the land that the sons of Israel possessed in the land of Canaan, the land which Moses had assigned to them, and which Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, then formally distributed among them.

(Joshua 14:1) 
These are the inheritances that the descendants of Israel received in the land of Canaan. Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders of the families from the tribes of Israel distributed these inheritances to them.

(Joshua 14:2) 
They divided all these inheritances by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses, for the nine and a half tribes.

(Joshua 14:3) 
For two tribes and half a tribe had already received their inheritance beyond the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given to them. This was apart from the Levites, who had not received any portion of land.

(Joshua 14:4) 
The descendants of Joseph, however, were divided into two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And the Levites received nothing in the land, except cities to dwell in, and the pasture lands surrounding those cities for their cattle and their other livestock.

(Joshua 14:5) 
So the descendants of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.

(Joshua 14:6) 
Then the descendants of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, spoke to him: 'You know what the Lord spoke to Moses, the man of God, concerning me and you at Kadesh-barnea.'

(Joshua 14:7) 
'I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out this land. And I brought him back a report that I believed was true.'

(Joshua 14:8) 
'But my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart. Yet I fully followed the Lord my God.'

(Joshua 14:9) 
'And on that day, Moses swore an oath, saying: "The land upon which your foot has walked shall be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever, because you have fully followed the Lord my God."'

(Joshua 14:10) 
'And now I am older, for the Lord has extended my life since the time He spoke this word to Moses, when Israel was walking in the wilderness. It has been forty-five years since the Lord spoke this promise to me, and now I am eighty-five years old.'

(Joshua 14:11) 
'Even to this day, I am as strong as I was at that time when Moses sent me to observe the land. I still have the same strength and vigor, both for fighting battles and for traveling long distances.'

(Joshua 14:12) 
'Therefore, give me this mountain land, which the Lord promised, in your hearing. In this place, as you have heard, are the Anakim, and great and fortified cities. Perhaps the Lord will be with me, and I will be able to drive them out.'

(Joshua 14:13) 
So Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.

(Joshua 14:14) 
And from that time, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, even to this present day, because he had fully followed the Lord, the God of Israel.

(Joshua 14:15) 
The name of Hebron was formerly called Kiriath Arba. Adam, the greatest man among the Anakim, was laid to rest there. And the land was at peace from battles.

(Joshua 15:1) 
The inheritance for the tribe of Judah was then allocated, according to their clans. This lot extended to the border of Edom, specifically to the wilderness of Zin, facing south and reaching the extreme southern part of the region.

(Joshua 15:2) 
Their southern border began at the southernmost tip of the Salt Sea,

(Joshua 15:3) 
And from its bay, which faces south, the boundary went up to the Ascent of Akrabbim. It then passed through Zin, went up from Kadesh-Barnea, reached Hezron, ascended to Addar, and circled around Karkaa.

(Joshua 15:4) 
From there, it passed through Heshmon and reached the Brook of Egypt. The boundary ended at the Great Sea. This was to be your southern border.

(Joshua 15:5) 
The eastern boundary was from the start of the Salt Sea up to the Jordan River. For the northern side, it began at the northern inlet of the Salt Sea and extended to the banks of the Jordan.

(Joshua 15:6) 
The boundary then went up to Beth Hoglah, passed north of Beth Arabah, and ascended to the Stone of Bohan, a landmark of the descendants of Reuben.

(Joshua 15:7) 
It then stretched to the borders of Debir in the Valley of Achor, looking north towards Gilgal, which is on the side of the Ascent of Adummim, south of the wadi. It passed through the waters of En Shemesh—which is the Spring of the Sun. Its end point would be at En Rogel.

(Joshua 15:8) 
After that, it went up through the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, along the southern side of the Jebusite city—this is Jerusalem. From there, it stretched to the summit of the mountain west of the Valley of Hinnom, which is on the northern side of the Valley of Rephaim.

(Joshua 15:9) 
It then passed from the mountaintop to the Spring of Nephtoah, and reached the villages of Mount Ephron. The boundary turned towards Baalah, which is Kiriath-Jearim—meaning 'the City of Forests'.

(Joshua 15:10) 
From Baalah, it circled westward to Mount Seir. It passed by the northern side of Mount Jearim—also known as Chesalon—then descended to Beth Shemesh, and passed through Timnah.

(Joshua 15:11) 
It reached the northern side of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron, passed Mount Baalah, and came to Jabneel. The boundary then ended at the coast of the Great Sea.

(Joshua 15:12) 
Thus, the Great Sea formed the western boundary. These were the boundaries for the clans of the tribe of Judah, marking their territories all around.

(Joshua 15:13) 
But to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a portion was given among the tribe of Judah, just as the Lord had commanded. This was Kiriath-Arba, the city of Anak's father—which is Hebron.

(Joshua 15:14) 
From there, Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, all from the lineage of Anak.

(Joshua 15:15) 
From there, he went up and came to the inhabitants of Debir, which was formerly called Kiriath-Sepher—meaning 'the City of Books'.

(Joshua 15:16) 
Caleb then said, 'Whoever attacks Kiriath-Sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah, my daughter, as his wife.'

(Joshua 15:17) 
And Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as his wife.

(Joshua 15:18) 
As she was leaving with her husband, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'

(Joshua 15:19) 
She replied, 'Give me a gift. You have given me dry land, but also give me springs of water.' So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.

(Joshua 15:20) 
This then is the inheritance for the tribe of Judah, divided among their families.

(Joshua 15:21) 
The cities in the southernmost part of the tribe of Judah, near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur.

(Joshua 15:22) 
And Kinah, Dimonah, and Adadah.

(Joshua 15:23) 
And Kadesh, Hazor, and Ithnan.

(Joshua 15:24) 
Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth.

(Joshua 15:25) 
And New Hazor, Kirioth Hezron—which is also called Hazor.

(Joshua 15:26) 
Amam, Shema, and Moladah.

(Joshua 15:27) 
And Hazar-Gaddah, Heshmon, and Beth-Pelet.

(Joshua 15:28) 
And Hazar-Shual, Beersheba, and Bizjothiah.

(Joshua 15:29) 
Baalah, Iim, and Ezem.

(Joshua 15:30) 
And Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah.

(Joshua 15:31) 
And Ziklag, Madmannah, and Sansannah.

(Joshua 15:32) 
Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. All these cities total twenty-nine, along with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 15:33) 
Now in the lowlands were Eshtaol, Zorah, and Ashnah.

(Joshua 15:34) 
And Zanoah, En-Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam.

(Joshua 15:35) 
And Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah.

(Joshua 15:36) 
And Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim. These fourteen cities, with their villages.

(Joshua 15:37) 
Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdal-Gad.

(Joshua 15:38) 
Dilean, Mizpah, and Joktheel.

(Joshua 15:39) 
Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon.

(Joshua 15:40) 
And Cabbon, Lahmas, and Kithlish.

(Joshua 15:1) 
The territory allotted to the tribe of Judah, divided among their families,
began from the southernmost limits of Coreae, extending into the desert of Sin,
and reached as far as the southern region of Kadesh-barnea.

(Joshua 15:2) 
Their southern boundary started from the farthest reach of the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea—
at its southern tongue, which faces south.

(Joshua 15:3) 
The boundary then went up to the Ascent of Scorpions, passed through Sena,
ascended to Kadesh-barnea, and reached Hezron.
From there, it went up to Addar and encircled Karkaa.

(Joshua 15:4) 
From Karkaa, it continued to Azmon and reached the Brook of Egypt.
The boundary then ended at the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.
This entire line marked your southern border.

(Joshua 15:5) 
The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea—extending to where the Jordan River empties into it.
The northern boundary began from the northernmost bay of the Salt Sea,
continuing along the Jordan River, in the direction that faces north.

(Joshua 15:6) 
The boundary then went up to Beth-hoglah, passing from the north to Beth-arabah,
and ascended to the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.

(Joshua 15:7) 
From there, the boundary extended beyond the Valley of Achor to Debar,
and from Gilgal—which faces the Ascent of Adummim on the south side of the wadi—
it passed to the waters, meaning the Spring of the Sun. Its final point was the Spring of Rogel.

(Joshua 15:8) 
Then it went up through the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, on the south side of the Jebusite territory—
which is Jerusalem. From there, it extended to the summit of the mountain opposite Gehenna on the west,
at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.

(Joshua 15:9) 
It reached the Spring of Nephtoah and the mountains of Ephron.
Then it curved towards Baalah, which is Kiriath-jearim.

(Joshua 15:10) 
From Baalah, it circled westward to Mount Seir and passed by the northern slope of Mount Jearim—
also known as Cheslon. Then it descended to Beth-shemesh and passed through Timnah.

(Joshua 15:11) 
It reached the northern side of Ekron, then curved to Shikkeron, and passed Mount Baalah.
It then came to Jabneel and extended to the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.

(Joshua 15:12) 
The western boundary itself was the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.
This completes the boundary for the tribe of Judah on all sides, according to their families.

(Joshua 15:13) 
But to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, Joshua gave a portion among the tribe of Judah,
just as the Lord had commanded him.
This was Kiriath-arba—named after Arba, the father of Anak—which is now known as Hebron.

(Joshua 15:14) 
From that place, Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai,
who were all from the lineage of Anak.

(Joshua 15:15) 
From there, Caleb went up and came to the inhabitants of Debir,
which was formerly called Kiriath-sepher, meaning 'the city of books' or 'city of letters'.

(Joshua 15:16) 
And Caleb declared: 'Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it,
I will give him my daughter Achsah to be his wife.'

(Joshua 15:17) 
Othniel, the son of Kenaz and Caleb’s younger brother, captured it.
So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as his wife.

(Joshua 15:18) 
As she was going with her husband, he persuaded her to ask her father for a field.
With a sigh, she dismounted from her donkey.
Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'

(Joshua 15:19) 
She replied: 'Give me a special gift! You have given me land in the arid south.
Please add some land with springs too.'
So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

(Joshua 15:20) 
This is the territory of the tribe of Judah, divided among their families.

(Joshua 15:21) 
The cities situated at the southernmost part of the tribe of Judah,
near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, and Agur.

(Joshua 15:22) 
And Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,

(Joshua 15:23) 
Kadesh, Hazor, Ithnan,

(Joshua 15:24) 
Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth,

(Joshua 15:25) 
Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth, and Hezron—which is another Hazor.

(Joshua 15:26) 
Amam, Shema, and Moladah,

(Joshua 15:27) 
Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, and Beth-pelet,

(Joshua 15:28) 
Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,

(Joshua 15:29) 
Baalah, Iim, and Ezem,

(Joshua 15:30) 
Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah,

(Joshua 15:31) 
Ziklag, Madmannah, and Sansannah,

(Joshua 15:32) 
Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon.
All these cities, with their surrounding villages, total twenty-nine.

(Joshua 15:33) 
Also in the western lowlands were Eshtaol, Zorah, and Ashnah,

(Joshua 15:34) 
Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

(Joshua 15:35) 
Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

(Joshua 15:36) 
Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and a hundred villages.
These are fourteen cities, along with their associated villages.

(Joshua 15:37) 
Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,

(Joshua 15:38) 
Dilean, Mizpah, and Joktheel,

(Joshua 15:39) 
Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon,

(Joshua 15:40) 
Cabbon, Lahmam, and Kitlish.
These are ten cities, along with their associated villages.

(Joshua 16:1) 
The territory assigned to the descendants of Joseph began its border from the Jordan River, opposite Jericho and its springs. This boundary extended from Jericho into the wilderness through the mountains near Bethel.

(Joshua 16:2) 
From Bethel, the border continued to Luz, then passed the territory of the Archites, reaching Ataroth.

(Joshua 16:3) 
Then it descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites, extending to the borders of Lower Beth-horon and Gezer. Finally, it reached the Great Sea, also known as the Mediterranean Sea.

(Joshua 16:4) 
Thus, the descendants of Joseph, the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, took possession of this allotted land.

(Joshua 16:5) 
The specific boundary for the descendants of Ephraim, according to their family divisions, was established with its eastern side extending to Ataroth-addar.

(Joshua 16:6) 
The western boundary continued northward past Michmethath. Then it turned eastward, passing by Taanath-shiloh, and from there it extended to the gate of Janoah.

(Joshua 16:7) 
From Janoah, it descended to Ataroth and Naarah, then reached Jericho, and finally ended at the Jordan River.

(Joshua 16:8) 
From Tappuah, the boundary extended westward to the Brook of Kanah, continuing until it reached the Great Sea.

(Joshua 16:9) 
This described region constitutes the tribal territory belonging to the descendants of Ephraim, organized by their family clans.

(Joshua 16:10) 
Also, there were specific cities set aside for the descendants of Ephraim, located within the territory allotted to the descendants of Manasseh, including all those cities and their associated villages.

(Joshua 16:1) 
The territory allotted by lot to the descendants of Joseph (which included both Manasseh and Ephraim) began at the Jordan River, facing Jericho, and its spring waters from the east. This border extended through the wilderness, going up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel.

(Joshua 16:2) 
From Bethel (which was also known as Luzah), the boundary continued, crossing the territory of the Archites at Ataroth.

(Joshua 16:3) 
Then it descended westward to the territory of Japhlet, extending as far as the border of lower Beth-Horon, and continuing to Gezer. The total territory of Joseph's descendants ended there, by the Great Sea to the west.

(Joshua 16:4) 
Thus, the descendants of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—took possession of their allotted land.

(Joshua 16:5) 
Now, the specific border for the clans of the tribe of Ephraim began. Their allotted territory extended from the eastern side of Ataroth-Addar, reaching to upper Beth-Horon.

(Joshua 16:6) 
The boundary then extended northward to the sea near Michmethath. From there, it turned eastward to Taanath-Shiloh and passed eastward from Janoah.

(Joshua 16:7) 
From Janoah, the border descended to Ataroth and Naarath. It then extended to Jericho and finally went out to the Jordan River.

(Joshua 16:8) 
From Tappuah, the border went westward to the Reed Valley, and its westernmost points reached the Great Sea. This describes the full possession of the tribe of Ephraim, according to its clans.

(Joshua 16:9) 
There were also cities set aside for the descendants of Ephraim located within the territory of the descendants of Manasseh—these included all such cities and their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 16:10) 
However, the descendants of Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So, the Canaanites continued to live among Ephraim's people, even until the time this record was written, and they were made to perform forced labor and pay tribute.

(Joshua 17:1) 
A land portion was indeed allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, because Manasseh was the firstborn son of Joseph. Machir, who was Manasseh's firstborn son and the father of Gilead, was a great warrior, and his descendants had already taken possession of Gilead and Bashan.

(Joshua 17:2) 
Then a land portion was also allotted to the rest of Manasseh's sons, each according to their family lines: for the sons of Abiezer, for the sons of Helek, for the sons of Asriel, for the sons of Shechem, for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph, listed by their family divisions.

(Joshua 17:3) 
However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, who was the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

(Joshua 17:4) 
These women came before Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the tribal leaders, saying: 'The Lord commanded through Moses that we should be given a land possession among our male relatives.' So Joshua, according to the Lord's command, gave them a possession among their father's relatives.

(Joshua 17:5) 
Thus, ten portions of land were allotted to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan River.

(Joshua 17:6) 
Indeed, there were five daughters of Manasseh who received an inheritance in the land of Canaan (these were the daughters of Zelophehad). And the remaining descendants of Manasseh obtained the land of Gilead.

(Joshua 17:7) 
The boundary of Manasseh began from Asher, at Michmethath, which faces Shechem. It then extended eastward, toward the inhabitants of the spring of Tappuah.

(Joshua 17:8) 
For the land of Tappuah was within the boundaries of Manasseh, but Manasseh did not claim it for itself. Instead, it belonged to the sons of Ephraim.

(Joshua 17:9) 
The boundaries then descended into the Valley of Reeds, passing through cities that belonged to Ephraim but were located in the midst of Manasseh's territory. The northern boundary of Manasseh stretched as far as the Mediterranean Sea, and its end was in the valley.

(Joshua 17:10) 
So Ephraim possessed territory to the south, and Manasseh to the north. Their boundary extended to the Mediterranean Sea, reaching into Asher from the north and into Issachar from the east.

(Joshua 17:11) 
Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh received these inherited cities: Beth-Shan and its dependent villages, Ibleam and its dependent villages. Also, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, the inhabitants of En-Dor and its dependent villages, likewise the inhabitants of Taanach and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages, along with a third part of the city called Nopheth.

(Joshua 17:12) 
However, the sons of Manasseh were not able to utterly destroy these cities. Instead, the Canaanites continued to dwell in that land.

(Joshua 17:13) 
But after the sons of Israel grew strong, they did subdue the Canaanites and made them pay tribute; however, they did not want to utterly destroy them.

(Joshua 17:14) 
Then the descendants of Joseph (the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh) spoke to Joshua, saying: 'Why have you given me only one portion, one lot of land, when I am such a numerous people, and the Lord has greatly blessed me?'

(Joshua 17:15) 
Joshua answered them: 'If you are indeed a numerous people, then go up into the forest country and clear out new spaces for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, because the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for your current possession.'

(Joshua 17:16) 
The descendants of Joseph replied: 'We cannot conquer the hill country, because the Canaanites who live in the lowlands have chariots made of iron. This includes those in Beth-Shan with its surrounding towns, as well as those in the Valley of Jezreel.'

(Joshua 17:17) 
And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and Manasseh: 'You are indeed a numerous people, and you possess great strength, so you will not have just one single lot of land.'

(Joshua 17:18) 
Instead, you will cross over into the hill country and clear out spaces for yourselves. Once the land is cleared and settled, with its proper boundaries, it will be yours. For even though the Canaanites have iron chariots and are very strong, you are still able to drive them out.'

(Joshua 17:1) 
The land portion was also assigned to the tribe of Manasseh because he was Joseph’s firstborn son, giving him a significant claim. For Machir, Manasseh's firstborn, who was the father of Gilead and a renowned leader of warriors, had already received the territories of Gilead and Bashan.

(Joshua 17:2) 
The rest of the land was allotted to the other descendants of Manasseh, organized by their family clans: to the sons of Abiezer, to the sons of Helek, to the sons of Asriel, to the sons of Shechem, to the sons of Hepher, and to the sons of Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, Joseph’s son, according to their family divisions.

(Joshua 17:3) 
Now, Zelophehad, who was a descendant through Hepher, Gilead, Machir, and Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

(Joshua 17:4) 
They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and all the tribal leaders, reminding them: 'The Lord specifically commanded Moses that we, as daughters, should also be given a land possession among our father’s kinsmen.' So, according to the Lord’s command, a land possession was given to them among their father’s brothers.

(Joshua 17:5) 
Thus, ten portions of land were measured out and allotted to the Manassite clans on the west side of the Jordan River, in addition to the territories of Gilead and Bashan which were already across the Jordan to the east.

(Joshua 17:6) 
This division was made because the daughters of Manasseh were indeed given an inheritance among his sons, and the land of Gilead was specifically given to the remaining male descendants of Manasseh.

(Joshua 17:7) 
The border for Manasseh started from Asher, extending to Michmethath, which is situated opposite Shechem. From there, the boundary continued eastward towards the city of En-Tappuah.

(Joshua 17:8) 
While the area around the spring of Tappuah was allotted to the sons of Manasseh, the actual town of Tappuah itself, though close to Manasseh's border, belonged to the sons of Ephraim.

(Joshua 17:9) 
The border then descended to the Wadi of Reeds. On the south side of this wadi were cities belonging to Ephraim, even though they were situated within Manasseh’s territory. The northern boundary of Manasseh followed the wadi, stretching out to the Great Sea and passing by a dense thicket of broom shrubs.

(Joshua 17:10) 
This arrangement meant that the territory of Ephraim lay to the south, while Manasseh’s land was to the north. The Great Sea formed the western boundary for both tribes. Their borders then merged in the region of Zebulun, extended northward into Asher's territory, and finally crossed the Jordan River from the east.

(Joshua 17:11) 
Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth-shean along with its villages, Ibleam with its surrounding settlements, the inhabitants of Dor and their towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and their villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and their villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo with their villages, comprising a third part of the Naphath region.

(Joshua 17:12) 
However, the sons of Manasseh were unable to completely conquer and dislodge the inhabitants of these cities. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them within their allotted territory.

(Joshua 17:13) 
Later, when the sons of Israel had become stronger and more established, they did not drive out the Canaanites completely but instead subjected them to forced labor and tribute, refusing to utterly destroy them as commanded.

(Joshua 17:14) 
Then the descendants of Joseph—the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh—spoke to Joshua, complaining: 'Why have you given us only one allotment, one single portion of land, as our inheritance? We are a very numerous people, whom the Lord has greatly blessed, and our territory is too small for us.'

(Joshua 17:15) 
Joshua replied to them: 'If you are indeed a numerous people, then go up into the forest country and clear out new living spaces for yourselves in the land occupied by the Perizzites and the Rephaim, because the mountainous region of Ephraim is not spacious enough for you.'

(Joshua 17:16) 
The descendants of Joseph answered, 'We are not strong enough to take control of the mountain peaks, because the Canaanites who live in the plains—including those in Beth-shean and its surrounding villages, and those in the Valley of Jezreel—possess powerful iron chariots.'

(Joshua 17:17) 
Joshua then said to the house of Joseph, meaning Ephraim and Manasseh: 'You are indeed a numerous people, and you possess great strength. You will not be confined to just one allotted portion of land.'

(Joshua 17:18) 
Instead, you must go into the mountainous region and clear the forests for yourselves, expanding your territory to its very limits. Even though the Canaanites possess iron chariots and are very strong, if you truly commit to driving them out, you will indeed be able to utterly defeat and destroy them.

(Joshua 18:1) 
All the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and there they set up the Tent of Meeting, for the land had now been subdued and was under their control.

(Joshua 18:2) 
However, seven tribes among the children of Israel had not yet received their allotted portions of land as their inheritance.

(Joshua 18:3) 
Joshua said to them, "How long will you be sluggish and indolent, refusing to go in and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given to you?"

(Joshua 18:4) 
"Choose three men from each tribe among you, so that I may send them out. They are to go throughout the land and survey it, making a detailed record of it according to the needs of each tribe, and then return to me."

(Joshua 18:5) 
"You are to divide the remaining land into seven portions for yourselves. Judah's territory is already established in the south, and the house of Joseph's territory is already in the north."

(Joshua 18:6) 
"Then, make a descriptive record of this central land, dividing it into seven portions, and bring it here to me. I will cast lots for you before the Lord, our God, to assign each portion."

(Joshua 18:7) 
"For the Levites will not receive a land portion among you; rather, the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. And the tribes of Gad and Reuben, along with half the tribe of Manasseh, have already received their possessions east of the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to them."

(Joshua 18:8) 
So when the men stood up to go through the land, Joshua commanded them, saying, "Go, traverse the land, and make your descriptive record of it. Then return to me, so that I may cast lots for you here in Shiloh before the Lord."

(Joshua 18:9) 
So the men went out, and as they passed through, they traversed the land. They made a written descriptive record of it, organized by cities and divided into seven distinct portions, and then they returned to Joshua in Shiloh.

(Joshua 18:10) 
Then Joshua cast lots in the presence of the Lord in Shiloh, and he divided the land among the children of Israel, assigning each tribe its portion.

(Joshua 18:11) 
The first lot drawn was for the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans, so that they might possess the land located between the territory of the children of Judah and the territory of the children of Joseph.

(Joshua 18:12) 
Their northern boundary began at the Jordan River, running along the northern side of Jericho. From there, it ascended westward into the mountainous regions, eventually reaching the wilderness of Beth-aven.

(Joshua 18:13) 
From there, it passed over to Luz—which is also called Bethel—along its southern side. Then it descended to Ataroth-addar, to the mountain that lies on the southern side of Lower Beth-horon.

(Joshua 18:14) 
From there, the boundary extended, circling towards the Mediterranean Sea, to the southern side of the mountain that faces Beth-horon toward the southwest. Its termination points were at Kiriath-baal—which is also called Kiriath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah. This described the western side of Benjamin's territory.

(Joshua 18:15) 
Now, the southern boundary began from the part of Kiriath-jearim, extending towards the Mediterranean Sea, and it reached the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.

(Joshua 18:16) 
It descended to the part of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom—which is on the northern side of the Valley of Rephaim. Then it continued down into Ge-hinnom, along the southern side of the Jebusite territory, eventually reaching the spring of Rogel.

(Joshua 18:17) 
From there it passed northward, and went out to En-shemesh—which means "Spring of the Sun."

(Joshua 18:18) 
It continued past the hills that are opposite the Ascent of Adummim, and then descended to Eben-bohen—which means "the Stone of Bohen," a memorial named after Bohen, the son of Reuben.

(Joshua 18:19) 
It passed along the northern side of Beth-hoglah, and its termination points were at the northern cove of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan River. This described the southern side of Benjamin's territory.

(Joshua 18:20) 
The Jordan River was its boundary on the eastern side. This describes the complete circuit of the boundaries for the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 18:21) 
The cities belonging to the children of Benjamin were: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz (also known as the Valley of Keziz),

(Joshua 18:22) 
Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, and Bethel,

(Joshua 18:23) 
Avvim, Parah, and Ophrah,

(Joshua 18:24) 
Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Gaba. These were twelve cities with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 18:25) 
Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth,

(Joshua 18:26) 
Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah,

(Joshua 18:27) 
Rekem, Irpeel, and Taralah,

(Joshua 18:28) 
And Zelah, Ha-eleph, and Jebus—which is also known as Jerusalem—Gibeath, and Kiriath. These were fourteen cities with their surrounding villages. This completes the description of the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans.

(Joshua 18:1) 
The entire assembly of the children of Israel gathered at Shiloh. There, they set up the Tabernacle of Testimony, and the land was brought under their control.

(Joshua 18:2) 
But there still remained among the children of Israel seven tribes that had not yet received their allotted portions of the land.

(Joshua 18:3) 
Then Joshua said to them: "How long will you neglect your duty and hesitate to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you?"

(Joshua 18:4) 
"Choose three men from each tribe, so that I can send them out. They will go and survey the land, describing it according to its various regions, and then bring back to me what they have described."

(Joshua 18:5) 
"Divide the land into seven portions for yourselves. Judah will remain within its own boundaries, and the house of Joseph will stay within its own borders."

(Joshua 18:6) 
"You are also to describe the land in seven portions and bring it here to me, so that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord, our God."

(Joshua 18:7) 
"For the Levites do not have a portion among you; rather, the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their possessions across the Jordan, on the eastern side, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to them."

(Joshua 18:8) 
When the men stood up to go and survey the land, Joshua instructed them, saying: "Go, survey the land and describe it, then return to me. Here in Shiloh, before the Lord, I will cast lots for you."

(Joshua 18:9) 
So they went and traveled throughout the land, describing it by cities in seven portions, writing it down in a scroll. Then they returned to Joshua in Shiloh.

(Joshua 18:10) 
There, before the Lord in Shiloh, Joshua cast lots for them and divided the land into seven portions among the children of Israel.

(Joshua 18:11) 
And the first lot came out for the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families. Their territory extended between the land of the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

(Joshua 18:12) 
Their northern boundary began at the Jordan, went along the side of Jericho to the north, then ascended westward, reaching the mountain in the wilderness of Bethel.

(Joshua 18:13) 
It then crossed over to Luz, along the southern side of Luz (which is Bethel), and descended to Ataroth Addar, on the mountain south of lower Bethhoron.

(Joshua 18:14) 
The boundary then curved and went around from the west, facing the sea, along the southern side of the mountain that overlooks Bethhoron to the southwest. Its ending points were at Cariathbaal, which is called Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Judah. This was the western side.

(Joshua 18:15) 
From the south, starting from Cariathiarim, the boundary extended towards the sea and reached the spring of the waters of Nephtoa.

(Joshua 18:16) 
It then descended to the side of the mountain that overlooks the valley of the children of Ennom, which is opposite the northern side of the valley of Raphaim. It descended into Geennom, alongside the Jebusite territory to the south, and reached the spring of Rogel.

(Joshua 18:17) 
Crossing northward, it extended to Ensemames, which is the Spring of the Sun, and continued past the mounds that are opposite the ascent of Adomim.

(Joshua 18:18) 
It descended to Abenboen, which is the stone of Boen, the son of Reuben. It then passed along the northern slopes of the Arabah, and went down into the Arabah.

(Joshua 18:19) 
It continued past the northern side of Bethagla. Its ending points were at the northern tongue of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan.

(Joshua 18:20) 
These were its eastern boundaries, along the Jordan. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin, with its surrounding boundaries and individual families.

(Joshua 18:21) 
The cities belonging to the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were: Jericho, Bethagla, and the Valley of Casis,

(Joshua 18:22) 
Betharaba, Samarim, and Bethel,

(Joshua 18:23) 
Avim, Aphara, and Ophera,

(Joshua 18:24) 
The city of Emona, Ophni, and Gabaa: twelve cities with their villages.

(Joshua 18:25) 
Gabaon, Rama, and Beeroth,

(Joshua 18:26) 
Mispha, Caphara, and Amosa,

(Joshua 18:27) 
and Recem, Jarephel, and Tharela,

(Joshua 18:28) 
And Sela, Eleph, and Jebus (which is Jerusalem), Gabaath, and Cariath: fourteen cities with their villages. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin, according to their families.

(Joshua 19:1) 
So the second lot was drawn, and the tribe of Simeon received their land for their clans.

(Joshua 19:2) 
Their inheritance was within the territory already granted to the tribe of Judah.

(Joshua 19:3) 
They received Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah.

(Joshua 19:4) 
And Hazar-shual, Balah, and Azem.

(Joshua 19:5) 
Also Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah.

(Joshua 19:6) 
And Ziklag, Beth-marcahoth, and Hazar-susah.

(Joshua 19:7) 
And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen. These were thirteen cities, along with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:8) 
Also Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. These were four cities, with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:9) 
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon, for all their clans. The Simeonites received their portion within the land designated for the tribe of Judah, because the land assigned to Judah was too large for them alone, so Simeon received their inheritance from Judah's portion.

(Joshua 19:10) 
The third lot was drawn for the tribe of Zebulun, for their clans. The boundary of their inheritance extended as far as Sarid.

(Joshua 19:11) 
From there, the border ran westward toward the Mediterranean Sea and Maralah. It reached Dabesheth and then continued to the wadi that is east of Jokneam.

(Joshua 19:12) 
From Sarid, the border turned eastward, toward the territory of Chisloth-tabor. From there, it went to Daberath, and then went up to Japhia.

(Joshua 19:13) 
From there, it continued eastward to Gath-hepher and Eth-kazin, then went on to Rimmon, which curves toward Neah.

(Joshua 19:14) 
The border then circled north of Hannathon, and its boundary extended to the Valley of Iphtahel.

(Joshua 19:15) 
It also included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:16) 
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 19:17) 
The fourth lot was drawn for the tribe of Issachar, for their clans.

(Joshua 19:18) 
Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem.

(Joshua 19:19) 
And Hapharaim, Shihon, and Anaharath.

(Joshua 19:20) 
And Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez.

(Joshua 19:21) 
And Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.

(Joshua 19:22) 
The boundary extended to Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh. The eastern end of their territory reached the Jordan River. There were sixteen cities, with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:23) 
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 19:24) 
The fifth lot was drawn for the tribe of Asher, for their clans.

(Joshua 19:25) 
Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph.

(Joshua 19:26) 
And Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. It reached Mount Carmel in the west, and Shihor-libnath.

(Joshua 19:27) 
The border then turned eastward to Beth-dagon, and touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel on the north, then Beth-emek and Neiel, and extended to Cabul on the left side.

(Joshua 19:28) 
It also included Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.

(Joshua 19:29) 
The border then turned back to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre. It then turned to Hosah, and its boundary reached the Mediterranean Sea from the district of Achzib.

(Joshua 19:30) 
It also included Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two cities, with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:31) 
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 19:32) 
The sixth lot was drawn for the tribe of Naphtali, for their clans.

(Joshua 19:33) 
Their border started from Heleph, from the oak tree in Zaanannim, and Adami, which is Nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and its eastern end reached the Jordan River.

(Joshua 19:34) 
The border then turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and from there it went to Hukkok. It reached Zebulun on the south, and Asher on the west, and Judah on the Jordan River on the east.

(Joshua 19:35) 
The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth.

(Joshua 19:36) 
And Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor.

(Joshua 19:37) 
And Kedesh, Edrei, and En-hazor.

(Joshua 19:38) 
And Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. These were nineteen cities, with their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:39) 
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.

(Joshua 19:40) 
The seventh lot was drawn for the tribe of Dan, for their clans.

(Joshua 19:1) 
The second lot of territory then fell to the tribe of Simeon, based on their families and clans. Their allotted inheritance was situated within the existing territory of the tribe of Judah.

(Joshua 19:2) 
The cities they received as their possession included Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah,

(Joshua 19:3) 
along with Hazar-shual, Balah, and Azem,

(Joshua 19:4) 
and Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah,

(Joshua 19:5) 
and Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,

(Joshua 19:6) 
and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen. This portion included thirteen cities and all of their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:7) 
Also, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. These four cities, with their villages, were also part of Simeon's inheritance.

(Joshua 19:8) 
All the villages surrounding these cities, stretching as far as Baalath Beer-Ramath in the region of the Negev desert, were also theirs. This entire portion was the inheritance given to the tribe of Simeon, according to their families and clans.

(Joshua 19:9) 
The cities that Simeon received as their inheritance were allotted from the portion of land originally assigned to the tribe of Judah. This was because Judah's territory was quite extensive, and so Simeon’s people were given their possession within Judah's assigned land.

(Joshua 19:10) 
The third lot of territory then fell to the sons of Zebulun, based on their families and clans. The boundary of their inheritance extended as far as Sarid.

(Joshua 19:11) 
From there, their boundary went up from the sea, by Maralah, and reached Dabbasheth. It continued to the wadi that lies opposite Jokneam.

(Joshua 19:12) 
From Sarid, it turned eastward toward the border of Chisloth-Tabor, and from there it proceeded to Daberath, and then ascended to Japhia.

(Joshua 19:13) 
From Japhia, it continued to Gath-hepher and Eth-kazin, and then went out to Rimmon-Methoar and Neah.

(Joshua 19:14) 
The boundary then encircled it on the north side at Hannathon, with its extremities extending into the Valley of Iphtahel.

(Joshua 19:15) 
Included were Kattah, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. In total, there were twelve cities and all their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:16) 
This was the inheritance given to the tribe of Zebulun, based on their families and clans, including all the cities and their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:17) 
The fourteenth lot of territory was then given to the sons of Issachar, based on their families and clans.

(Joshua 19:18) 
Their inheritance included Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem,

(Joshua 19:19) 
along with Hapharaim, Shion, and Anaharath,

(Joshua 19:20) 
and Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez,

(Joshua 19:21) 
and Rameth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.

(Joshua 19:22) 
Their boundary then reached as far as Tabor, Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh, with its limits extending to the Jordan River. In total, there were sixteen cities and all their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:23) 
This was the possession given to the sons of Issachar, based on their families and clans, including all the cities and their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:24) 
The fifth lot of territory then fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher, based on their families and clans.

(Joshua 19:25) 
Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph,

(Joshua 19:26) 
and Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph again, along with Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. The boundary extended as far as Mount Carmel, which is by the sea, and to the stream of Shihor-Libnath.

(Joshua 19:27) 
The boundary then turned eastward to Beth-dagon and reached as far as the territory of Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel to the north, extending to Beth-emek and Neiel. It then proceeded to Cabul, towards its left (or northern) side.

(Joshua 19:28) 
Also, Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, with the boundary extending all the way to the great city of Sidon.

(Joshua 19:29) 
The boundary of their allotted territory then turned towards Hosah, extending as far as the strongly fortified city of Tyre. Its limits then stretched out to the sea from the region of Achzib.

(Joshua 19:30) 
Also, Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob were included. In total, there were twenty-two cities and all their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:31) 
This was the possession given to the tribe of the sons of Asher, based on their families and clans, including all the cities and their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:32) 
The sixth lot of territory was then given to the sons of Naphtali, based on their families and clans.

(Joshua 19:33) 
Their boundary began from Heleph, from Elon-bezaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and extended to Jabneel, as far as Lakkum. Its limits then reached to the Jordan River.

(Joshua 19:34) 
The boundary then turned westward to Aznoth-Tabor, and from there it proceeded to Hukkok. It passed through the territory of Zebulun towards the south, and through the territory of Asher towards the west, and through the territory of Judah towards the Jordan River on the east.

(Joshua 19:35) 
Among their fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

(Joshua 19:36) 
and Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor,

(Joshua 19:37) 
and Kedesh, Edrei, and En-hazor,

(Joshua 19:38) 
and Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. In total, there were nineteen cities and all their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:39) 
This was the possession given to the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, based on their families and clans, including all the cities and their surrounding villages.

(Joshua 19:40) 
The seventh lot of territory was then given to the tribe of the sons of Dan, based on their families and clans.

(Joshua 20:1) 
The Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:

(Joshua 20:2) 
“Speak to the children of Israel and say: ‘Set aside for yourselves the cities of refuge, about which I spoke to you through Moses.’”

(Joshua 20:3) 
“So that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee to them, and not be guilty of the blood of those whose relative is close to avenge them.”

(Joshua 20:4) 
“When he flees to one of these cities, he will stand at the gate of the city and speak his case to the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city and give him a place to live.”

(Joshua 20:5) 
“And if the avenger of the slain man's blood enters the city, they will not hand over the killer to him; because he struck his neighbor without intending to, and it is proven that he held no hatred against him before this event.”

(Joshua 20:6) 
“And he will remain in that city until he stands before the judgment of the people, and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then the killer will return and go to his own home, to the city and place from which he had fled.”

(Joshua 20:7) 
So they consecrated Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountain region of Naphtali, and Shechem in the mountain region of Ephraim, and Kiriath-Arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain region of Judah.

(Joshua 20:8) 
And across the Jordan, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 20:9) 
These cities were designated for all the children of Israel and for the foreigners who dwelled among them, so that anyone who killed a person unintentionally might flee to them, and not die at the hand of the avenger of blood, who sought vengeance, until he stood before the assembly for judgment.

(Joshua 20:1) 
The Lord then spoke to Joshua, giving him this command:

(Joshua 20:2) 
"Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: 'Set aside the cities of refuge, those which I spoke about to you through Moses,

(Joshua 20:3) 
so that anyone who unintentionally kills another person, without knowing it, can flee to them. Such a person will not be considered guilty of murder by the avenger of blood—the relative who seeks vengeance for the deceased.

(Joshua 20:4) 
When someone flees to one of these cities, he is to stand at the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city, proving his innocence. They will then receive him and give him a place to live among them.

(Joshua 20:5) 
If the avenger of blood pursues him, the elders must not hand over the manslayer to his custody. This is because the manslayer killed his neighbor unintentionally and without any prior hatred towards him.

(Joshua 20:6) 
He is to remain in that city until he stands before the judgment of the community regarding his case, and he must stay there until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Only then may he return and go back to his own city and home from which he fled.

(Joshua 20:7) 
So they consecrated Kedesh in Galilee, located in the mountainous region of Naphtali; and Shechem in the mountainous region of Ephraim; and Kiriath-Arba, which is Hebron, in the mountainous region of Judah.

(Joshua 20:8) 
And across the Jordan River, to the east of Jericho, beyond all the eastern plains, they designated Bezer in the wilderness, a city on the plain from the tribe of Reuben; and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 20:9) 
These cities were appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the foreigners who lived among them, so that anyone who unintentionally caused a person's death could flee to them. This ensured they would not die by the hand of the avenger of blood before they could stand trial before the community.

(Joshua 21:1) 
Then the heads of the Levitical families approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun, and the tribal leaders from each tribe of the sons of Israel, in Shiloh in the land of Canaan.

(Joshua 21:2) 
And they spoke to them, saying, “The Lord commanded through Moses that cities should be given to us for our habitation, along with their pasturelands for our livestock.”

(Joshua 21:3) 
So the sons of Israel gave from their own tribal territories, according to the Lord’s command, these cities and their surrounding pasturelands.

(Joshua 21:4) 
And the first lot was drawn for the families of Kohath. The sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Kohathite lineage of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, and from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.

(Joshua 21:5) 
To the rest of the sons of Kohath, that is, the Levites of their families, ten cities were given from the tribe of Ephraim, and from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 21:6) 
Furthermore, to the sons of Gershon, according to their families, thirteen cities were given from the tribe of Issachar, and from the tribe of Asher, and from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.

(Joshua 21:7) 
And to the sons of Merari, according to their families, twelve cities were given from the tribe of Reuben, and from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun.

(Joshua 21:8) 
So the sons of Israel gave to the Levites these cities and their pasturelands, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses, by casting lots.

(Joshua 21:9) 
From the tribes of the sons of Judah and Simeon, they gave these cities, whose names are as follows:

(Joshua 21:10) 
They were cities for Aaron, from the families of Kohath, of the lineage of Levi, because their lot came up first.

(Joshua 21:11) 
They gave Kirjath Arba—the city of Arba, father of Anak—which is also called Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, and its pasturelands all around it.

(Joshua 21:12) 
However, the fields and the villages around Hebron, they had given to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, for his possession.

(Joshua 21:13) 
Therefore, to the sons of Aaron the priest, they gave Hebron, and Libnah, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa,

(Joshua 21:14) 
and Holon, and Debir,

(Joshua 21:15) 
and Ashan, and Jutta, and Beth Shemesh, with their pasturelands: these nine cities from these two tribes.

(Joshua 21:16) 
From the tribe of Benjamin, they gave Gibeon, and Geba, and Anathoth, and Almon, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:17) 
All thirteen cities, with their pasturelands, they gave to the sons of Aaron the priest.

(Joshua 21:18) 
To the rest of the Kohathite Levites, from the tribe of Ephraim, they gave these cities and their pasturelands: Shechem, a city of refuge, and Gezer,

(Joshua 21:19) 
and Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:20) 
Also from the tribe of Dan, they gave Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:21) 
From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Taanach, and Gath Rimmon, with their pasturelands: two cities.

(Joshua 21:22) 
All ten cities, and their pasturelands, were given to the remaining sons of Kohath.

(Joshua 21:23) 
To the sons of Gershon, from the lineage of Levi, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave these cities of refuge: Golan in Bashan, and Beeshterah, with their pasturelands: two cities.

(Joshua 21:24) 
From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion, and Dabareh, and Jarmuth, and En Gannim, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:25) 
From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal, and Abdon, and Helkath, and Rehob, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:26) 
From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, a city of refuge, and Hammon-dor, and Kiriathaim, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:27) 
All thirteen cities, and their pasturelands, were given to the sons of Gershon according to their families.

(Joshua 21:28) 
To the sons of Merari, the Levites, according to their families, from the tribe of Zebulun, they gave Jokneam, and Kartah, and Dimnah, and Nahalal, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:29) 
From the tribe of Reuben beyond the Jordan River, they gave Bezer, and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:30) 
From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge, and Mahanaim, and Heshbon, and Jazer, with their pasturelands: four cities.

(Joshua 21:31) 
These are the twelve cities for the sons of Merari, according to their families.

(Joshua 21:32) 
All the cities for the Levites, within the territory of the sons of Israel, were forty-eight, along with their pasturelands.

(Joshua 21:33) 
Each one of these cities had its own pasturelands surrounding it.

(Joshua 21:34) 
So all the work that the Lord had spoken to Moses, concerning giving the land to the sons of Israel, was now completed. And they possessed the land.

(Joshua 21:35) 
They entered into the land and settled in their assigned territories, and throughout all their borders.

(Joshua 21:36) 
Not one of the many good promises that the Lord had made to the sons of Israel failed; every single one was fulfilled.

(Joshua 21:37) 
These are their assigned territories according to their families.

(Joshua 21:38) 
From the cities and their pasturelands that the sons of Aaron the priest received, who were of the lineage of Kohathite Levites, there were nineteen cities.

(Joshua 21:39) 
But to the rest of the Kohathites, that is, the Levites, there were twenty-two cities.

(Joshua 21:40) 
And to the Gershonite sons, thirty-six cities.

(Joshua 21:1) 
Then the heads of the Levitical families went to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua, the son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of each of the other tribes.

(Joshua 21:2) 
They spoke to them in Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying: “The Lord commanded through Moses that we should be given cities to live in, along with their surrounding lands for the pasture of our livestock.”

(Joshua 21:3) 
So the sons of Israel, according to the Lord’s command, gave cities and their surrounding lands from their own possessions to the Levites.

(Joshua 21:4) 
The lot then came out for the families of Kohath. The sons of Aaron, who were priests, received thirteen cities from the tribal territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.

(Joshua 21:5) 
For the rest of the sons of Kohath—the Levites who were not priests—ten cities were given from the tribal territories of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 21:6) 
To the sons of Gershon, thirteen cities were given from the tribal territories of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the other half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 21:7) 
And to the sons of Merari, according to their family clans, twelve cities were given from the tribal territories of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.

(Joshua 21:8) 
So the sons of Israel gave these cities and their surrounding lands to the Levites by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Joshua.

(Joshua 21:9) 
These are the names of the cities that were given from the tribal territory of the sons of Judah and from the tribal territory of the sons of Simeon:

(Joshua 21:10) 
These cities were for the sons of Aaron from the families of Kohath, who were from the tribe of Levi, because their lot had been chosen first.

(Joshua 21:11) 
They received Kiriath-Arba, which is the city of Arba, the father of Anak—this city is Hebron in the mountainous region of Judah—along with its surrounding pasture lands.

(Joshua 21:12) 
However, the fields and villages surrounding Hebron had already been given to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, for his possession.

(Joshua 21:13) 
Therefore, to the sons of Aaron the priest, they gave Hebron, a city of refuge, along with its pasture lands. They also gave Libnah with its pasture lands,

(Joshua 21:14) 
and Jattir, and Eshtemoa, and Holon, and Debir, and Ain, and Juttah, and Beth-Shemesh, each with their pasture lands. That makes nine cities from these two tribes.

(Joshua 21:15) 
From the tribe of Benjamin, they received Gibeon and Geba, Anathoth and Almon, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:16) 
All these cities for the sons of Aaron, the priests, totalled thirteen, each with its surrounding pasture lands.

(Joshua 21:17) 
Now for the remaining Levites of the Kohathite families, from the tribe of Ephraim, they gave Shechem—a city of refuge in the mountainous region of Ephraim—along with its pasture lands. Also Gezer with its pasture lands,

(Joshua 21:18) 
and Kibzaim with its pasture lands, and Beth-Horon with its pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:19) 
From the tribe of Dan, they received Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Aijalon, and Gath-Rimmon, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:20) 
From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Taanach and Gath-Rimmon, each with their pasture lands. That makes two cities.

(Joshua 21:21) 
All these cities, totalling ten with their pasture lands, were given to the other, non-priestly, sons of Kohath.

(Joshua 21:22) 
For the sons of Gershon, from the clan of Levi, from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Bezer—a city of refuge—and Bosra with its pasture lands.

(Joshua 21:23) 
And from the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishion and Daberath, and Jarmuth, and En-Gannim, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:24) 
This verse seems to be a slight textual variant of the previous one, listing cities for Issachar. It means: From the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishion, Daberath, Jarmuth, and En-Gannim, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:25) 
From the tribe of Asher, they received Mishal, and Abdon, and Helkath, and Rehob, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:26) 
From the tribe of Naphtali, they received Kedesh in Galilee—a city of refuge—and Hammoth-Dor, and Kartan, each with their pasture lands. That makes three cities.

(Joshua 21:27) 
All these cities for the sons of Gershon, according to their families, totalled thirteen cities with their pasture lands.

(Joshua 21:28) 
For the sons of Merari, Levites according to their families, from the tribe of Zebulun, they received Jokneam, and Kartah, and Rimmon, and Nahalal, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:29) 
From the tribe of Reuben, they received Bezer, and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:30) 
From the tribe of Gad, they received Ramoth in Gilead—a city of refuge—and Mahanaim, and Heshbon, and Jazer, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.

(Joshua 21:31) 
These are the cities for the sons of Merari according to their clans, totalling twelve cities.

(Joshua 21:32) 
All the cities of the Levites, within the possession of the sons of Israel, amounted to forty-eight cities, each with its surrounding pasture lands.

(Joshua 21:33) 
These were the specific cities, each with their pasture lands all around them.

(Joshua 21:34) 
And the Lord gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their fathers. The children of Israel took possession of the entire land and settled in it.

(Joshua 21:35) 
No enemy dared to resist them; rather, all the surrounding nations were subjected to their rule.

(Joshua 21:36) 
Not one thing failed of all the good promises the Lord had spoken to the house of Israel. Everything was fulfilled.

(Joshua 21:37) 
These are the cities which the Lord gave to the sons of Israel,

(Joshua 21:38) 
according to the division of the four tribes listed above.

(Joshua 21:39) 
And the Lord gave them peace in all their borders, and He removed their enemies from them, just as He had sworn to their fathers.

(Joshua 21:40) 
Everything was fulfilled, just as the Lord had sworn. And the Lord gave them their land.

(Joshua 22:1) 
Then Joshua called the descendants of Reuben, and the descendants of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

(Joshua 22:2) 
And he said to them: "You have done everything that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you. You have also obeyed me in all things.

(Joshua 22:3) 
You have not abandoned your brothers for a very long time, even to this present day, guarding the command of the Lord your God.

(Joshua 22:4) 
Now, therefore, return and go to your homes in the land you possess, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to you across the Jordan River."

(Joshua 22:5) 
"But be careful to diligently keep and completely fulfill the commandment and the law that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all His ways, and observe His commands, and cling to Him, and serve Him in all worship and in every work."

(Joshua 22:6) 
And Joshua blessed them and sent them away. So they returned to their homes.

(Joshua 22:7) 
Moses had also given a possession in Bashan to half of the tribe of Manasseh. And therefore, to the remaining half-portion, Joshua gave an inheritance among their other brothers on the west side of the Jordan River. When he sent them away to their homes, and had blessed them,

(Joshua 22:8) 
he said to them: "Return to your settlements with much wealth and riches, with silver and gold, bronze and iron, and many garments. Divide the spoil taken from your enemies with your brothers."

(Joshua 22:9) 
So the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the sons of Israel, from Shiloh, which is located in the land of Canaan. They went to enter Gilead, the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the command of the Lord through Moses.

(Joshua 22:10) 
When they came to the Jordan River banks, in the land of Canaan, they built a very large altar near the Jordan.

(Joshua 22:11) 
And the sons of Israel heard a widely spread report that the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar in the land of Canaan, on the banks of the Jordan, facing the sons of Israel.

(Joshua 22:12) 
And all the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh, intending to go up and fight against them.

(Joshua 22:13) 
Meanwhile, they sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead.

(Joshua 22:14) 
And with him were ten princes, one from each of the tribes of Israel, men who were heads of their families.

(Joshua 22:15) 
When they came to the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they spoke to them, saying:

(Joshua 22:16) 
"Thus says the entire assembly of the Lord: 'What is this transgression? Why have you abandoned the Lord, the God of Israel, by building a sacrilegious altar, and withdrawing from His worship?'"

(Joshua 22:17) 
"Is it not enough for us that we sinned at Baal-Peor, and the wickedness remains to this present day, and because of this a plague came upon the Lord's people?

(Joshua 22:18) 
And if you today abandon the Lord, tomorrow His wrath will rage against all of Israel."

(Joshua 22:19) 
"But if you think that the land you possess is unclean, cross over to the land where the Lord's Tabernacle is, and live among us. Only do not depart from the Lord and from our fellowship by building an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God.

(Joshua 22:20) 
Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, commit a transgression against the Lord's command, and His wrath fell upon all the people of Israel? And he was just one man, and if only he had perished alone in his wickedness!"

(Joshua 22:21) 
And the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the princes of Israel's delegation:

(Joshua 22:22) 
"The Lord, the Mighty God! The Lord, the Mighty God! He Himself knows, and Israel, you also understand: if with an intention of transgression or contempt for the Lord we have erected this altar, do not spare us.

(Joshua 22:23) 
Rather, let Him Himself take vengeance on you. And if we did this with the intention of placing burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings upon it, may we be accursed.

(Joshua 22:24) 
But we acted out of concern, fearing this, and considering what your children might say to our children in the future: 'What do you have to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?'

(Joshua 22:25) 
The Lord has placed a boundary between us and you, O sons of Reuben and Gad, the Jordan River. And therefore, you have no part in the Lord.' And thus your children might turn our children away from worshipping the Lord.

(Joshua 22:26) 
For this reason, we said: 'Let us build an altar for ourselves, not for burnt offerings, nor for offering sacrifices,

(Joshua 22:27) 
but as a witness between us and you, and our descendants, that we may serve the Lord and frequently observe His worship with burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings.' This way, your children will never again say to our children: 'You have no share in the Lord.'"

(Joshua 22:28) 
"And if ever they wish to say this, you will answer them: 'Behold the altar of the Lord which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices, but as a witness for us and for you.'"

(Joshua 22:29) 
"Far be it from us to depart from the Lord, and to abandon His worship, by building an altar for offering burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and peace offerings, apart from the altar of the Lord our God, which is established before His Tabernacle."

(Joshua 22:30) 
When they heard this, Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the Israelite delegation who were with him, were appeased.

(Joshua 22:31) 
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh: "Today we know that the Lord is with us, because you have not followed this counsel of transgression, and you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the Lord."

(Joshua 22:32) 
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes returned from the sons of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and reported the words to them.

(Joshua 22:33) 
And the report pleased all who heard it. And they praised God, and no longer attempted to go up against them and fight.

(Joshua 22:34) 
And the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built the altar, and they called it "Witness", because it was a witness that the Lord Himself is God.

(Joshua 22:1) 
Then Joshua called for the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half of the tribe of Manasseh,

(Joshua 22:2) 
and said to them: "You have done everything that Moses, the Lord's servant, commanded you; and you have also obeyed me in everything I commanded you.

(Joshua 22:3) 
You have not abandoned your brothers for a long time, even until this very day, carefully observing the commands of the Lord your God.

(Joshua 22:4) 
Now, therefore, return and go to your homes, to the land of your inheritance which Moses, the Lord's servant, gave you beyond the Jordan River.

(Joshua 22:5) 
However, make sure you carefully observe and fulfill the command and the law that Moses, the Lord's servant, commanded you: to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commands, and to hold fast to Him, serving Him with all your heart and with all your soul.

(Joshua 22:6) 
Joshua then called them together and blessed them.

(Joshua 22:7) 
And to the two tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given an inheritance in Bashan. Because of this, Joshua gave the other half of Manasseh their share of the land on the other side of the Jordan River, on the western side.

(Joshua 22:8) 
And when he sent them away and commanded them to go to their homes, he said to them: "Return to your homes with much wealth and riches, with silver and gold and bronze and iron and many garments. Divide the spoils of your plunder with your brothers.

(Joshua 22:9) 
So the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the other sons of Israel, from Shiloh which is in Canaan. They went to enter Gilead, the land of their inheritance, which they had obtained according to the command of the Lord through Moses.

(Joshua 22:10) 
When they came to the Jordan's banks, in the land of Canaan, they built a very large altar by the Jordan.

(Joshua 22:11) 
And the other sons of Israel heard a report, saying: "The sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, facing the other sons of Israel."

(Joshua 22:12) 
When they heard this, all the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh, intending to go up and fight against them.

(Joshua 22:13) 
However, they first sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead.

(Joshua 22:14) 
They also sent ten chiefs with him, one from each tribe, who were heads of their families from all the tribes of Israel.

(Joshua 22:15) 
When these men came to the sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they spoke to them,

(Joshua 22:16) 
saying: "This is what the entire assembly of the Lord commands: 'What is this transgression by which you have violated the command of the Lord God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar and turning away from His worship?'

(Joshua 22:17) 
Is the sin of Peor not enough for you, for which, even to this present day, a great plague and calamity came upon the Lord's people?

(Joshua 22:18) 
And now you are again abandoning the Lord, so that tomorrow His wrath will be stirred up against all Israel?

(Joshua 22:19) 
If you think the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land where the Lord's Tabernacle is, and live among us. Do not build another altar besides the altar of the Lord our God.

(Joshua 22:20) 
Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, violate the Lord's command, and His wrath fell upon all Israel? He was only one man, and would that he alone had perished in his wickedness!"

(Joshua 22:21) 
Then the sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered the chiefs of the Israelite delegation,

(Joshua 22:22) 
saying: "The Lord God knows, and let Israel itself understand: If we built this altar with an intention of transgression or contempt for the Lord, may He not spare us today!

(Joshua 22:23) 
But if we did it with the intention of placing burnt offerings, sacrifices, or peace offerings upon it, may He Himself investigate and judge.

(Joshua 22:24) 
Did we not rather do this with a certain thought and concern, saying: 'Lest perhaps your sons say to our sons tomorrow: What do you have to do with the Lord God of Israel?

(Joshua 22:25) 
The Lord has set the Jordan River as a boundary between us and you, O sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. Therefore, you have no portion in the Lord. And by this occasion, your sons might turn our sons away from fearing the Lord.

(Joshua 22:26) 
Therefore we said: 'Let us build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings nor for sacrificing victims,

(Joshua 22:27) 
but as a witness between us and you and our descendants and yours, that we may serve the Lord and fulfill His worship, and that we may continually offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. This is so that your sons may never say to our sons tomorrow: You have no portion in the Lord.'

(Joshua 22:28) 
And if they should desire to say so, our sons will respond to them: 'Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, but as a witness for us and for you.'

(Joshua 22:29) 
Far be this wickedness from us, that we should withdraw from the Lord and abandon His worship, by building an altar for burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, other than the altar of the Lord our God, which is before His Tabernacle!"

(Joshua 22:30) 
When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the Israelite delegation who were with him heard these things, they were appeased. And they understood that the sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh had not built the altar out of their own design, but out of fear of future generations separating from God.

(Joshua 22:31) 
Then Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them: "Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this crime, and you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the Lord."

(Joshua 22:32) 
So Phinehas and the chiefs returned from the sons of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the other sons of Israel, and reported their words to them.

(Joshua 22:33) 
The report pleased all who heard it. And the sons of Israel praised God, and they no longer spoke of going up and fighting against them and destroying the land of their inheritance.

(Joshua 22:34) 
And the sons of Reuben and Gad called the altar they had built "Witness," because it was a witness that the Lord Himself is God.

(Joshua 23:1) 
Much later, after the Lord had given Israel a time of peace from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua had grown old, and his age had advanced significantly,

(Joshua 23:2) 
Joshua called together all of Israel—their elders, their leaders, their judges, and their officers. He then said to them: "I have become old, and my life's journey has advanced and moved forward past my youth.

(Joshua 23:3) 
You yourselves have seen all the Lord your God has done for this nation, and for all the nations around you. You have seen how He Himself fought for you.

(Joshua 23:4) 
Now, because He has divided among you the assigned portions of all these lands, from the Jordan River to the Great Sea (the Mediterranean), and from where the sun rises in the east to where it sets in the west, and has given them to you by lot, just as the Lord your God commanded you,

(Joshua 23:5) 
The Lord your God Himself will drive them out before you. He will overturn them from your path, and you will take possession of their lands, just as He promised you.

(Joshua 23:6) 
Therefore, strengthen yourselves and be careful to keep and perform all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses. Do not deviate from these commands, neither to the right nor to the left.

(Joshua 23:7) 
Do not even mix with these nations that remain among you. Do not mention the names of their false gods, nor swear by them, nor serve them, nor worship them.

(Joshua 23:8) 
Instead, cling steadfastly to the Lord your God, just as you have done up to this present day.

(Joshua 23:9) 
And then, the Lord will drive out before you great and very strong nations. No one will be able to resist you.

(Joshua 23:10) 
One man among you will pursue a thousand men. This will happen because the Lord your God Himself will fight for you, just as He promised.

(Joshua 23:11) 
Just be sure of this: that you love the Lord your God.

(Joshua 23:12) 
But if you choose to turn away and cling to the remnants of these nations that are among you, and join yourselves to them, and intermarry with them,

(Joshua 23:13) 
know for certain that then the Lord your God will not drive them out from before you. Instead, they will become for you a pit and a snare, a stumbling block at your side, and thorns in your eyes, until He removes you and utterly destroys you from this good land that He has given you.

(Joshua 23:14) 
Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth (meaning, I am about to die). And you know in all your heart and in all your soul that not one of all the good promises which the Lord your God spoke concerning you has failed; not one of them has proven void.

(Joshua 23:15) 
But just as all the good things that the Lord your God spoke to you have been fulfilled in deed, both good and evil, so also the Lord will bring upon you every evil He has spoken, until He removes you and utterly destroys you from this good land that He has given you.

(Joshua 23:16) 
When you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you, and you serve foreign gods and worship them, immediately the wrath of the Lord will rise against you. You will then swiftly be removed from this good land that He has given you.

(Joshua 24:1) 
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together in Shechem. He called all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people to come, and they stood before the presence of the Lord.

(Joshua 24:2) 
Then Joshua said to all the people: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived across the Euphrates River from the very beginning, and they worshipped false gods.

(Joshua 24:3) 
But I took your father Abraham from the region of Mesopotamia and led him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants, and I gave him Isaac.

(Joshua 24:4) 
To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the land of Mount Seir to possess as his own, but Jacob and his sons eventually went down into Egypt.

(Joshua 24:5) 
Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I punished Egypt with many miraculous signs and wonders.

(Joshua 24:6) 
And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you arrived at the sea. The Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and cavalry all the way to the Red Sea.

(Joshua 24:7) 
You cried out to the Lord, and He placed a thick darkness between you and the Egyptians. Then He brought the sea over them and drowned them. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Afterwards, you lived in the wilderness for a very long time.

(Joshua 24:8) 
Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan River. When they fought against you, I gave them into your hands, and you took possession of their land and utterly destroyed them.

(Joshua 24:9) 
Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose up and fought against Israel. He sent for and summoned Balaam, the son of Beor, to put a curse on you.

(Joshua 24:10) 
But I refused to listen to Balaam. Instead, I used him to bless you, and so I delivered you from Balak's power.

(Joshua 24:11) 
Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Jebusites, and Hivites. But I delivered them into your hands.

(Joshua 24:12) 
I sent the hornets before you, and they drove out the two kings of the Amorites from their lands—not by your own sword, nor by your bow.

(Joshua 24:13) 
I gave you a land for which you had not labored, and cities that you had not built, so that you might live in them. I also gave you vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.

(Joshua 24:14) 
Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him with an undivided and most sincere heart. Cast away from among you the false gods that your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord only.

(Joshua 24:15) 
But if it seems wrong to you to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today whom you will serve instead: either the gods that your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.

(Joshua 24:16) 
Then the people answered and said: "It is unthinkable for us to abandon the Lord and serve other gods!

(Joshua 24:17) 
For the Lord our God is the one who brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. He performed mighty signs before our very eyes and preserved us throughout all the journey we undertook, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.

(Joshua 24:18) 
He also drove out all the nations from before us, even the Amorites who lived in the land that we were entering. Therefore, we too will serve the Lord, for He alone is our God."

(Joshua 24:19) 
Then Joshua said to the people: "You will not be able to serve the Lord truly, because He is a holy God, a strong God, and a jealous God. He will not overlook your wicked deeds or your sins.

(Joshua 24:20) 
If you abandon the Lord and serve foreign gods, He will turn against you, bring disaster upon you, and utterly destroy you, even after all the good He has done for you."

(Joshua 24:21) 
But the people said to Joshua, "No! We will certainly serve the Lord!"

(Joshua 24:22) 
Joshua then said to the people, "You yourselves are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to serve Him." And they answered, "We are witnesses."

(Joshua 24:23) 
Then Joshua said, "Now, therefore, remove the foreign gods that are among you, and turn your hearts fully to the Lord, the God of Israel."

(Joshua 24:24) 
The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the Lord our God, and we will obey His voice."

(Joshua 24:25) 
So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he laid out statutes and ordinances for them in Shechem.

(Joshua 24:26) 
Joshua wrote all these words in the book of the Law of the Lord. Then he took a very large stone and set it up there under the oak tree that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.

(Joshua 24:27) 
And he said to all the people: "Look, this stone will be a witness against you, for it has heard all the words that the Lord spoke to us. It will stand as a reminder, lest you later deny and lie to the Lord your God."

(Joshua 24:28) 
So Joshua sent the people away, each person to their own inherited land.

(Joshua 24:29) 
After these events, Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.

(Joshua 24:30) 
They buried him within the borders of his own inherited land at Timnath-serah, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.

(Joshua 24:31) 
Israel served the Lord throughout all the days of Joshua, and throughout all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all the great works that the Lord had done for Israel.

(Joshua 24:32) 
The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had carried up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred young lambs. This place became the possession of the descendants of Joseph.

(Joshua 24:33) 
Eleazar also, the son of Aaron, died. They buried him in Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.

(Joshua 24:1) 
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together in Shechem, and he called all their elders, their leaders, their judges, and their officers to assemble. And they presented themselves before the presence of the Lord.

(Joshua 24:2) 
Then Joshua spoke to all the people, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Your ancestors lived beyond the River Euphrates from the earliest times. This included Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor. And they served other gods there.''

(Joshua 24:3) 
So I took your ancestor Abraham from the land of Mesopotamia and brought him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants, and I gave him Isaac.

(Joshua 24:4) 
And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess as his own, but Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.

(Joshua 24:5) 
Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many miraculous signs and wonders, just as it is written. And I led you and your ancestors out of Egypt.

(Joshua 24:6) 
And you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen all the way to the Red Sea.

(Joshua 24:7) 
Then your ancestors cried out to the Lord. He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and He brought the sea over them and drowned them. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt, and you lived in the wilderness for a long time.

(Joshua 24:8) 
Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived beyond the Jordan River. When they fought against you, I handed them over into your power, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.

(Joshua 24:9) 
Then Balak, the son of Zippor, who was the king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent for and summoned Balaam, the son of Beor, so that he might curse you.

(Joshua 24:10) 
But I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, I blessed you completely, and I delivered you from his hand.

(Joshua 24:11) 
Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your power.

(Joshua 24:12) 
I sent hornets before you, and they drove out the two kings of the Amorites from their places, not by your sword or by your bow.

(Joshua 24:13) 
And I gave you a land for which you had not toiled, and cities that you had not built, so that you might live in them. And I gave you vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant, from which you now eat.

(Joshua 24:14) 
Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him with a perfect heart and with truth. Remove the gods whom your ancestors served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord alone.

(Joshua 24:15) 
But if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today whom you wish to serve. Will it be the gods whom your ancestors served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.

(Joshua 24:16) 
And the people answered and said: 'Far be it from us that we should abandon the Lord and serve foreign gods!'

(Joshua 24:17) 
For the Lord our God is He who brought us and our ancestors out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. He performed great signs before our eyes and protected us on every road by which we traveled and among all the peoples through whom we passed.

(Joshua 24:18) 
And He drove out all the nations, including the Amorites, the inhabitants of the land into which we entered. Therefore, we also will serve the Lord, because He Himself is our God.

(Joshua 24:19) 
Then Joshua said to the people: 'You will not be able to serve the Lord, for He is a holy God, and a strong, jealous God. He will not forgive your wicked deeds and your sins.'

(Joshua 24:20) 
If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, He will turn against you and afflict you. He will utterly destroy you, after He has done so much good for you.

(Joshua 24:21) 
But the people said to Joshua: 'By no means! We will indeed serve the Lord!'

(Joshua 24:22) 
And Joshua said to the people: 'You yourselves are witnesses that you have chosen the Lord for yourselves, to serve Him.' And they responded: 'We are witnesses!'

(Joshua 24:23) 
Now, therefore, he said, 'Remove the foreign gods that are among you, and turn your hearts towards the Lord, the God of Israel.'

(Joshua 24:24) 
And the people said to Joshua: 'We will serve the Lord our God, and we will obey His voice.'

(Joshua 24:25) 
So on that day, Joshua made a covenant with the people and established for them statutes and ordinances in Shechem.

(Joshua 24:26) 
And he wrote all these words in the book of the Law of the Lord. He also took a large stone and set it up there under the oak tree that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.

(Joshua 24:27) 
And he said to all the people: 'Behold, this very stone will be a witness against you. For it has heard all the words of the Lord which He has spoken to you. Therefore, do not deny Him afterwards and lie to the Lord your God.'

(Joshua 24:28) 
Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.

(Joshua 24:29) 
After these events, Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old.

(Joshua 24:30) 
And they buried him within the boundaries of his own inherited land in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.

(Joshua 24:31) 
And Israel served the Lord throughout all the days of Joshua, and during the days of the elders who lived for a long time after Joshua, and who had known all the works of the Lord that He had done for Israel.

(Joshua 24:32) 
Also, the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. And it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.

(Joshua 24:33) 
Eleazar, the son of Aaron, also died. And they buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas, his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
