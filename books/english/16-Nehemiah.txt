(Nehemiah 1:1) 
This is the account of Nehemiah, the son of Hilkiah. It happened in the month of Chislev—the ninth month of the Jewish calendar—in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, and I was in the citadel of Susa.

(Nehemiah 1:2) 
And Hanani, one of my brothers, came to me with some men from Judah. I questioned them about the Jews who had escaped and survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.

(Nehemiah 1:3) 
And they said to me: 'The remaining exiles there in the province of Judah are in great distress and public shame. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and its gates have been burned to ashes by fire.'

(Nehemiah 1:4) 
As soon as I heard these words, I sat down, wept, and mourned for many days. I fasted and prayed in the presence of the God of Heaven.

(Nehemiah 1:5) 
And I said: 'I implore You, Lord God of Heaven, O mighty, great, and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and shows mercy to those who love Him and obey His commands!'

(Nehemiah 1:6) 
May Your ears be open and Your eyes attentive, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant, which I am praying before You today, day and night, for Your servants, the children of Israel. I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which they have committed against You—my father's household and I have also sinned.

(Nehemiah 1:7) 
We have acted corruptly and strayed from You, for we have not kept Your commandments, Your statutes, and Your ordinances, which You commanded through Your servant Moses.

(Nehemiah 1:8) 
Remember the word that You gave to Your servant Moses, saying: 'If you transgress, I will scatter you among the nations.

(Nehemiah 1:9) 
But if you return to Me, and keep My commands, and do them—even if you have been carried away to the furthest reaches of the universe—from there I will gather you and bring you to the place which I have chosen, that My Name may reside there.'

(Nehemiah 1:10) 
These are Your servants and Your people, whom You redeemed with Your great power and Your mighty hand.

(Nehemiah 1:11) 
I implore You, Lord, incline Your ear to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to revere Your Name. Grant success to Your servant today, and grant him favor in the sight of this man—for I was the king's cupbearer.

(Nehemiah 1:1) 
These are the historical accounts of Nehemiah, son of Helchia. This occurred in the month of Casleu, during the twentieth year of the king's reign, while I was residing in the citadel of Susa.

(Nehemiah 2:1) 
Now it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that the wine was placed before him. I, Nehemiah, then took the wine and gave it to the king. Before this day, I had not shown any sadness in his presence, for it was forbidden to approach the king with a sorrowful demeanor.

(Nehemiah 2:2) 
And the king said to me, 'Why is your face sad, seeing that I see no sign of illness in you? This can only be sorrow within your heart.' And at this question, I became greatly afraid.

(Nehemiah 2:3) 
And I said to the king, 'O king, live forever! Why should my face not show sorrow, seeing that the city where my fathers are buried—Jerusalem—lies desolate, and its gates have been consumed by fire?'

(Nehemiah 2:4) 
And the king said to me, 'What do you wish to request?' And at that very moment, I prayed to the God of the universe.

(Nehemiah 2:5) 
And I said to the king, 'If it seems good to the king, and if your servant finds favor in your sight, I request that you send me to Judea, to the city where my fathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.'

(Nehemiah 2:6) 
And the king said to me (with the queen sitting beside him), 'For what period of time will your journey be, and when will you return?' And the matter pleased the king, and he sent me. I also set a specific time for my return for him.

(Nehemiah 2:7) 
And I said to the king, 'If it is good in the sight of the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the river Euphrates, so that they may grant me safe passage until I come to Judea.'

(Nehemiah 2:8) 
'And also a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, so that he may give me timber to cover the gates of the fortress that belongs to the temple, and the walls of the city of Jerusalem, and the house into which I will enter.' And the king granted me all these things, because the good hand—the favor—of my God was upon me.

(Nehemiah 2:9) 
So I came to the governors of the region beyond the river, and I delivered the king's letters to them. The king had also sent with me captains of the army and horsemen for protection and escort.

(Nehemiah 2:10) 
Now when Sanaballat the Horonite and Tobias, the Ammonite official, heard of this, they were greatly displeased. They were greatly distressed that a man had come seeking the prosperity of the children of Israel.

(Nehemiah 2:11) 
And I came to Jerusalem, and I was there for three days.

(Nehemiah 2:12) 
Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me, and I did not tell anyone what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me, except for the animal on which I was riding.

(Nehemiah 2:13) 
And I went out by night through the Valley Gate, and proceeded towards the Dragon's Spring, and to the Dung Gate. As I went, I carefully inspected the broken-down walls of Jerusalem and its gates that had been consumed by fire.

(Nehemiah 2:14) 
Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool. But there was no place for the animal on which I was riding to pass through, because of the debris.

(Nehemiah 2:15) 
So I went up by the torrent in the night, and again inspected the wall. After completing my survey, I returned and came back to the Valley Gate.

(Nehemiah 2:16) 
And the officials of the city did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because up to that time I had not yet told the Jews, or the priests, or the nobles, or the officials, or the rest of those who were to do the work, of my intentions.

(Nehemiah 2:17) 
Then I said to them, 'You see the deep affliction in which we are, because Jerusalem lies desolate and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be an object of shame and reproach.'

(Nehemiah 2:18) 
And I recounted to them how the hand—the favor—of my God had been good upon me, and also the words of the king which he had spoken to me. And they said, 'Let us arise and build!' And their hands were strengthened for the good work.

(Nehemiah 2:19) 
But when Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the Ammonite official, and Gosem the Arab heard of it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and they said, 'What is this thing that you are doing? Are you intending to rebel against the king?'

(Nehemiah 2:20) 
And I answered them, saying, 'The God of the universe Himself will help us, and we, His servants, will build. But as for you, you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.'

(Nehemiah 2:1) 
It happened in the month of Nisan, the first month of the Jewish calendar, in the twentieth year of the reign of King Artaxerxes. The wine was before the king, and it was my duty to take the wine and give it to him. I was not normally sad or downcast in his presence.

(Nehemiah 2:2) 
And the king said to me, 'Why is your face so sad, seeing that I do not see you to be physically ill? This can only be a deep sadness in your heart.' And I was greatly afraid.

(Nehemiah 2:3) 
Then I said to the king, 'May the king live forever! How could my face not be sad, given that the city—the place where my ancestors are buried—lies in ruins, and its gates have been consumed by fire?'

(Nehemiah 2:4) 
Then the king said to me (with the queen sitting beside him), 'What is it you are requesting, then, with such a look on your face?' At that very moment, I prayed silently to the God of Heaven.

(Nehemiah 2:5) 
And I said to the king, 'If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I request that you send me to Judea, to the city where my ancestors are buried—Jerusalem—so that I may rebuild it.'

(Nehemiah 2:6) 
Then the king said to me (with the queen still sitting beside him), 'How long will your journey take, and when will you return?' The king was pleased with my request, and he sent me. I specified a time for my return to him.

(Nehemiah 2:7) 
And I also said to the king, 'If it pleases the king, please provide me with letters of passage addressed to the governors of the province Beyond the River—the region west of the Euphrates—so that they will allow me to travel through their territories until I reach Judea.'

(Nehemiah 2:8) 
And also a letter addressed to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, instructing him to provide me with timber. This wood will be used to construct the gates for the fortress connected to the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house where I will reside. The king granted all my requests, for the good hand of my God was upon me and guided him.

(Nehemiah 2:9) 
So I traveled to the governors of the province Beyond the River and presented them with the king's letters. The king had also provided me with an escort of army officers and cavalrymen.

(Nehemiah 2:10) 
When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about my arrival, they were deeply displeased and greatly troubled, because a man had come to seek the welfare and prosperity of the children of Israel.

(Nehemiah 2:11) 
Finally, I arrived in Jerusalem, and I remained there for three days.

(Nehemiah 2:12) 
Then, during the night, I arose with only a few men accompanying me. I had not told anyone what God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. There was no pack animal with us, only the animal I myself was riding.

(Nehemiah 2:13) 
I went out through the Valley Gate at night, proceeding towards the Dragon's Well and then to the Dung Gate. As I went, I carefully inspected the walls of Jerusalem, observing how they lay in ruins, and how its gates had been completely destroyed by fire.

(Nehemiah 2:14) 
From there, I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool. But at that point, there was so much rubble and damage that there was no room for the animal I was riding to pass through.

(Nehemiah 2:15) 
So I continued my inspection by ascending the valley at night, carefully examining the wall. Afterward, I returned by way of the Valley Gate.

(Nehemiah 2:16) 
The local officials, however, did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. Indeed, I had not yet revealed anything to the Jewish people, the priests, the nobles, the other officials, or anyone else who would be involved in the work, keeping my plans secret until the proper time.

(Nehemiah 2:17) 
Then I said to them, 'You yourselves see the terrible condition we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been completely burned down by fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer suffer this shame and disgrace.'

(Nehemiah 2:18) 
I also told them about the gracious hand of my God that had been upon me, and repeated the words the king had spoken to me. Immediately, they responded, 'Let us rise up and build!' And their resolve was greatly strengthened for this good work.

(Nehemiah 2:19) 
But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plans, they mocked us and scorned us. They said, 'What is this thing you are doing? Are you actually rebelling against the king?'

(Nehemiah 2:20) 
I answered them directly and said, 'The God of Heaven Himself will give us success! We, His servants, will rise up and build. But as for you, you have no share, no right, and no historical claim in Jerusalem.'

(Nehemiah 3:1) 
And Eliashib, the high priest, along with his priestly brethren, began building the Sheep Gate. They consecrated this section of the wall and installed its doors, continuing to consecrate the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and then all the way to the Tower of Hananeel.

(Nehemiah 3:2) 
Next to them, the men of Jericho built their section of the wall. And after them, Zachur, the son of Amri, built his portion.

And between the upper chamber at the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants completed their work.

(Nehemiah 3:1) 
Then Eliashib, the high priest, along with his fellow priests, rose up and began the work. They rebuilt the Sheep Gate and consecrated it, setting its doors in place.

(Nehemiah 3:32) 
Between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants rebuilt their sections.

(Nehemiah 3:33) 
Now it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became very angry and greatly disturbed. He then began to mock the Jews.

(Nehemiah 3:34) 
He then spoke before his brethren and the leading men of Samaria, saying: 'What are these feeble Jews doing? Will their leaders permit them to continue? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a single day? Will they revive the stones from these heaps of burnt rubbish?'

(Nehemiah 3:35) 
Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, also spoke, saying: 'Even if they build, if a fox goes up on their wall, it will break down their stone wall!'

(Nehemiah 3:36) 
Hear us, O our God, because we have become an object of contempt! Turn their scorn back upon their own heads, and deliver them into disgrace in the land of their captivity.

(Nehemiah 3:37) 
Do not cover their iniquity, and let their sin not be blotted out from before Your sight, because they have provoked You in the presence of those who are rebuilding.

(Nehemiah 3:38) 
So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half of its intended height. For the people had a mind to work, and their hearts were fully committed to the task.

(Nehemiah 3:39) 
Now it came to pass that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the damage to the walls of Jerusalem was being closed up, and that the breaches had begun to be repaired, they became exceedingly angry.

(Nehemiah 3:40) 
And they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, intending to cause confusion and disrupt the work.

(Nehemiah 4:1) 
It happened that when Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he became extremely angry. He was deeply provoked and mocked the Jewish people.

(Nehemiah 4:2) 
He then spoke before his brothers and the leaders of the Samaritans, saying: "What are these weak Jews doing? Will the nations leave them alone? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a single day? Will they build from the dusty stones that have been burned?"

(Nehemiah 4:3) 
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was standing next to him, and he added: "Let them build! If even a fox goes up, it will jump over their stone wall."

(Nehemiah 4:4) 
Nehemiah prayed: "Hear us, O our God, because we have become despised. Turn their scorn back onto their own heads, and hand them over as plunder in a land of captivity—a land where they themselves are enslaved."

(Nehemiah 4:5) 
"Do not cover their iniquity, and let their sin not be erased from Your sight, because they have deeply disturbed those who are building."

(Nehemiah 4:6) 
So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined up to half its original height. The people had returned their hearts and minds fully to the work.

(Nehemiah 4:7) 
Now it came to pass that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the extensive damage to the wall of Jerusalem was being repaired and that the broken places had begun to be closed up, they became exceedingly angry.

(Nehemiah 4:8) 
They all gathered together with a common purpose: to come and fight against Jerusalem, intending to spread malicious rumors and cause great trouble.

(Nehemiah 4:9) 
But we prayed to our God, and we also set up guards on the wall, day and night, against these enemies.

(Nehemiah 4:10) 
Meanwhile, the people of Judah said among themselves: "The strength of those carrying loads is diminished. There is too much rubble, and we will not be able to finish building the wall."

(Nehemiah 4:11) 
And our enemies said: "They will not know or understand our plan until we come right into their midst, kill them, and make the work stop completely."

(Nehemiah 4:12) 
It also happened that the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, from all the places where they lived, warnings that the enemies were coming to attack us.

(Nehemiah 4:13) 
Therefore, I stationed people in the lowest parts of the area, behind the wall, at strategic intervals around it. I placed the people there with their swords, spears, and bows.

(Nehemiah 4:14) 
And I saw their fear, so I stood up and spoke to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, Who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your homes."

(Nehemiah 4:15) 
So it happened that when our enemies heard it had been reported to us, and that God had thwarted their evil plan, we all returned to the wall, each man to his own work.

(Nehemiah 4:16) 
From that day onward, half of the young men among our people were doing the construction work, and the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The leaders were stationed behind all the house of Judah to supervise.

(Nehemiah 4:17) 
Those who were building the wall, and those who were carrying burdens and loading them onto the wall, worked with one hand and held a sword in the other.

(Nehemiah 4:18) 
And each of the builders wore his sword strapped to his side as he built. The trumpeter stood next to me, ready to sound the alarm.

(Nehemiah 4:19) 
Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another."

(Nehemiah 4:20) 
"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rush to us there. Our God will fight for us."

(Nehemiah 4:21) 
So they continued the work, and half of them held spears from the first appearance of dawn until the stars came out in the evening.

(Nehemiah 4:22) 
At that same time, I also said to the people: "Let each man and his servant remain within Jerusalem, so that they can be our guards both day and night."

(Nehemiah 4:23) 
As for me, my brothers, my personal servants, and the guards who were with me, we did not take off our clothes—each man only removed them for washing.

(Nehemiah 5:1) 
Then a great outcry began among the people, and their wives joined them in raising their voices against their fellow Jewish brothers.

(Nehemiah 5:2) 
Some of the people began to say: 'We have so many sons and daughters, and we need grain for them to eat and for us all to survive.'

(Nehemiah 5:3) 
Other people said: 'We are being forced to pledge our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral to get grain because of this severe hunger.'

(Nehemiah 5:4) 
And yet other people were saying: 'We had to borrow money using our fields and vineyards as collateral just to pay the king's taxes.'

(Nehemiah 5:5) 
And now, though we are of the same flesh as our brothers, and our children are just like their children, we are forced to subjugate our own sons and daughters into slavery. Some of our daughters are already serving as female slaves, and we have no way to buy them back, because other people have taken possession of our fields and our vineyards.

(Nehemiah 5:6) 
And I became extremely angry when I heard their desperate outcry and these specific grievances.

(Nehemiah 5:7) 
I considered the situation carefully within my own heart, and then I publicly rebuked the nobles and the officials. I asked them: 'Are each of you truly demanding excessive interest from your own brothers?' Afterwards, I called a large public assembly to confront them.

(Nehemiah 5:8) 
I also spoke to them, saying: 'You all know that we have made every effort to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold into slavery to foreign nations. And now, you yourselves are selling your own brothers, forcing us to buy them back again into our own community?' They remained completely silent, unable to find any words to justify themselves.

(Nehemiah 5:9) 
Then I continued, saying: 'What you are doing is absolutely not right! Why are you not living your lives in the reverent fear of our God, so that our enemy nations do not have reason to mock and condemn us?'

(Nehemiah 5:10) 
Even I, my brothers, and my servants have generously lent both money and much grain to these very people. Therefore, let us now all agree to stop demanding this excessive interest from them.

(Nehemiah 5:11) 
Today, you must return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses. Furthermore, you must also give back to them the one-hundredth part of the money, grain, wine, and oil—which represents the excessive interest you have been accustomed to demanding from them.

(Nehemiah 5:12) 
And the nobles replied: 'We will restore everything, and we will demand nothing further from them; we will indeed do exactly as you have spoken.' So, I called for the priests and had them administer an oath, ensuring that the nobles would do precisely what I had instructed.

(Nehemiah 5:13) 
Then, as an additional warning, I shook out the fold of my garment, and I declared: 'May God likewise shake out every man who fails to fulfill this solemn promise, stripping him of his house and all his possessions derived from his labor! May he be completely emptied and left with nothing!' The entire assembly responded with 'Amen!' and then they praised God. So, the people who had made the promise carried out what had been spoken.

(Nehemiah 5:14) 
Now, from the very day that the king appointed me to serve as governor over the land of Judah—which spanned from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, a full twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ever took the food allowance or salary that was due to governors.

(Nehemiah 5:15) 
However, the governors who were before me had been a severe burden to the people. They continually took from them forty shekels of silver daily, along with generous provisions of bread, wine, and money. Even their own servants were allowed to domineer over the people. But I, for my part, did not act in this way, because of my reverent fear of God.

(Nehemiah 5:16) 
Instead, I threw myself into the work of rebuilding this wall. I did not purchase any land for myself, and all my servants were likewise engaged in the work alongside everyone else.

(Nehemiah 5:17) 
Moreover, a hundred and fifty Jewish people and officials regularly ate at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the Gentile nations residing around our borders.

(Nehemiah 5:18) 
Even though my daily provision included one ox, six choice sheep, and various birds were also supplied to me, along with a wide selection of wine served once each day—despite all this abundance, I did not demand the official robes or lavish clothing due to governors. This was because the burden of servitude resting upon these people was already exceedingly heavy.

(Nehemiah 5:19) 
Remember me, O my God, for good, in consideration of all the benevolent actions I have carried out for this people.

(Nehemiah 5:1) 
A great cry arose from the people, and even from their wives, against their own Jewish brothers.

(Nehemiah 5:2) 
And there were some who said: "We have many sons and daughters, and we must buy wheat so that we can eat and live."

(Nehemiah 5:3) 
And others said: "We must mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get money, so we can buy wheat because of the famine."

(Nehemiah 5:4) 
And still others said: "We had to borrow money to pay the king's taxes, and we had to pledge our fields and our vineyards as collateral."

(Nehemiah 5:5) 
"And now, our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers—we are all human beings, yet our children are no different from theirs. Look, we are forced to sell our sons and daughters into slavery to pay our debts. Some of our daughters are already enslaved as servants. We have nothing left, because our fields and vineyards are already taken by others to whom we owe money."

(Nehemiah 5:6) 
I, Nehemiah, became exceedingly angry when I heard their outcry and these words.

(Nehemiah 5:7) 
I thought about it carefully, and then I rebuked the nobles and the officials, saying to them: "You are each demanding usury—excessive interest—from your own brothers!" Then I gathered a large assembly against them, and I spoke to them further:

(Nehemiah 5:8) 
"We, as you know, have redeemed our Jewish brothers who had been sold to the Gentiles, doing so according to our ability to pay. And now you yourselves are selling your own brothers, so that we have to buy them back again?" They were silent, having no answer to give.

(Nehemiah 5:9) 
And I said to them: "What you are doing is not good. Why do you not walk in the fear of our God, so that you do not bring reproach upon us from our Gentile enemies?"

(Nehemiah 5:10) 
"I myself, along with my brothers and my servants, have also lent them money and grain. Let us now release them from these debts of usury."

(Nehemiah 5:11) 
"Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses. And also release them from the hundredth part of the money, grain, wine, and oil that you customarily demand from them as interest."

(Nehemiah 5:12) 
And they said: "We will restore everything, and we will demand nothing from them. We will do exactly as you say." Then I called the priests and made them swear an oath that they would act according to this promise.

(Nehemiah 5:13) 
Furthermore, I shook out the fold of my garment and said: "Thus may God shake out from his house and from his possessions every man who does not keep this promise. May he be shaken out and emptied!" And the entire assembly said: "Amen!" And they praised God. So the people did as they had promised.

(Nehemiah 5:14) 
Now, from the day that the king commanded me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—a total of twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food rations that were due to me as governor.

(Nehemiah 5:15) 
In contrast, the former governors who were before me had burdened the people severely. They had taken from them bread and wine, in addition to forty shekels of silver. Moreover, even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because I acted out of reverence for God.

(Nehemiah 5:16) 
Instead, I dedicated myself to the work on this wall, building it with my own hands, and I did not purchase any land for myself. All my servants also worked alongside everyone else on the wall.

(Nehemiah 5:17) 
Furthermore, one hundred and fifty men, comprising Jews and officials, along with those who came to us from the surrounding Gentile nations, regularly ate at my table.

(Nehemiah 5:18) 
And for me, each day, one ox was prepared, along with six chosen sheep, not counting the poultry. And every ten days, wine of all kinds, and many other provisions, were supplied. Yet, despite all this, I never demanded the governor's allowance that was due to me, because the famine was pressing heavily upon the people.

(Nehemiah 5:19) 
Remember me, my God, for good, because of all that I have done for this people.

(Nehemiah 6:1) 
It happened that Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies heard that I had completed rebuilding the city wall, and that there were no gaps left in it for a gate. So, Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying: 'Come, let us meet together in the villages on the plain of Ono.'

(Nehemiah 6:2) 
They were plotting to harm me.

(Nehemiah 6:3) 
I sent messengers back to them, saying: 'I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. If I leave this work to meet you, it will be interrupted.'

(Nehemiah 6:4) 
So they sent the same message to me four times, and each time I responded to them with the same answer.

(Nehemiah 6:5) 
Then, on the fifth time, Sanballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.

(Nehemiah 6:6) 
It was written in the letter: 'It has been reported among the nations, and Geshem confirms it, that you and the Judeans are plotting to rebel. That is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to make yourself king, according to these rumors.'

(Nehemiah 6:7) 
'Furthermore, you have appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, saying: “There is a king in Judea!” Now, therefore, I am reporting these matters to the king. So come now, let us meet and discuss this together.'

(Nehemiah 6:8) 
But I sent word back to him, saying: 'None of these things you are talking about are actually happening; you are simply inventing these things from your own mind.'

(Nehemiah 6:9) 
For all of them wanted to frighten us, thinking that our hands would become weak from the work, and that we would cease our labor. Because of this, I strengthened my resolve even more.

(Nehemiah 6:10) 
Then I went into the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home. He said: 'Let us go and shut ourselves inside the temple of God, and close the temple doors; for they are coming to kill you, and they will surely come at night to murder you.'

(Nehemiah 6:11) 
But I said: 'Should a man like me flee? And who is there, a man like me, who would enter the temple to save his life? I will not go in.'

(Nehemiah 6:12) 
Then I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this 'prophecy' to me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

(Nehemiah 6:13) 
They had hired him to intimidate me, to make me sin by seeking refuge in the temple, and then they would have a scandal to publicly accuse me with.

(Nehemiah 6:14) 
Remember them, O my God, for these actions of Tobiah and Sanballat. Also remember the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who kept trying to frighten me.

(Nehemiah 6:15) 
So the entire wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, which was within fifty-two days of starting the work.

(Nehemiah 6:16) 
When all our enemies heard about it, and all the nations around us saw it, they were humbled and realized that this work had been accomplished by God Himself.

(Nehemiah 6:17) 
Moreover, in those days, many letters from the nobles of Judah were being sent to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah were coming to them in return.

(Nehemiah 6:18) 
For many in Judah were bound to him by oath, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, son of Arah. And his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah, so they were connected by family alliances.

(Nehemiah 6:19) 
They even spoke of Tobiah's good deeds to me, and they reported my words back to him. Meanwhile, Tobiah kept sending letters to try and frighten me.

(Nehemiah 7:1) 
After the city wall was rebuilt, I set up the doors in the gates. I then organized and registered the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites.

(Nehemiah 7:2) 
I put my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the Jerusalem fortress, in charge of the city. Hananiah was a man of great integrity, who feared God more than most people.

(Nehemiah 7:3) 
I told them: 'Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is high in the sky. And while the guards are still on duty, they are to close and bar the gates.' I also appointed guards from among the residents of Jerusalem, with each one serving in his turn and standing watch over the area directly in front of his own house.

(Nehemiah 7:4) 
The city itself was very large and spacious, but there were few people living in it, and many houses still had not been rebuilt.

(Nehemiah 7:5) 
Then God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the common people so I could register them by their family lines. I found the record of the family lines of those who had returned first from exile, and this is what was written in it:

(Nehemiah 7:6) 
These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his own town.

(Nehemiah 7:7) 
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nahum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was as follows:

(Nehemiah 7:8) 
The descendants of Parosh: two thousand one hundred seventy-two.

(Nehemiah 7:9) 
The descendants of Shephatiah: three hundred seventy-two.

(Nehemiah 7:10)

The descendants of Zaccai: seven hundred sixty.

(Nehemiah 7:15) 
The descendants of Binnui: six hundred forty-eight.

(Nehemiah 7:16) 
The descendants of Bebai: six hundred twenty-eight.

(Nehemiah 7:17) 
The descendants of Azgad: two thousand three hundred twenty-two.

(Nehemiah 7:23) 
The descendants of Bezai: three hundred twenty-four.

(Nehemiah 7:24) 
The descendants of Hariph: one hundred twelve.

(Nehemiah 7:25) 
The descendants of Gibeon: ninety-five.

(Nehemiah 7:26) 
The men of Bethlehem and Netophah: one hundred eighty-eight.

(Nehemiah 7:27) 
The men of Anathoth: one hundred twenty-eight.

(Nehemiah 7:28) 
The men of Beth-Azmaveth: forty-two.

(Nehemiah 7:29) 
The men of Kiriath-Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth: seven hundred forty-three.

(Nehemiah 7:30) 
The men of Ramah and Geba: six hundred twenty-one.

(Nehemiah 7:31) 
The men of Michmash: one hundred twenty-two.

(Nehemiah 7:32) 
The men of Bethel and Ai: one hundred twenty-three.

(Nehemiah 7:33) 
The men of the other Nebo: fifty-two.

(Nehemiah 7:34) 
The descendants of the other Elam: one thousand two hundred fifty-four.

(Nehemiah 7:35) 
The descendants of Harim: three hundred twenty.

(Nehemiah 7:36) 
The descendants of Jericho: three hundred forty-five.

(Nehemiah 7:37) 
The descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono: seven hundred twenty-one.

(Nehemiah 7:38) 
The descendants of Senaah: three thousand nine hundred thirty.

(Nehemiah 7:39) 
The priests: The descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua: nine hundred seventy-three.

(Nehemiah 7:40) 
The descendants of Immer: one thousand fifty-two.

(Nehemiah 7:1) 
After the wall was finished, and I had set up the city gates, I then appointed the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites for their duties.

(Nehemiah 7:2) 
I gave orders to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah, the commander of the fortress of Jerusalem—because he was a trustworthy man, and feared God more than anyone else there.

(Nehemiah 7:3) 
And I told them: 'Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun's full heat has arrived. While the guards are still on duty, they are to close and bar the gates tightly. Also, appoint guards from the citizens of Jerusalem, each for his own shift, and each one standing guard opposite his own house.'

(Nehemiah 7:4) 
Now the city itself was very large and expansive, but there were few people living within it, and many houses had not yet been rebuilt. God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the common people so I could register them. I found the register of those who had first returned from exile, and in it was written:

(Nehemiah 7:5) 
'These are the descendants of the province who came up from the captivity, from the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had carried away. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judea, each to his own city.'

(Nehemiah 7:6) 
Those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nahum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

(Nehemiah 7:7) 
The descendants of Parosh, 2,172.

(Nehemiah 7:8) 
The descendants of Shephatiah, 372.

(Nehemiah 7:9) 
The descendants of Arah, 652.

(Nehemiah 7:10) 
The descendants of Pahath-Moab, of the descendants of Jeshua and Joab, 2,818.

The descendants of Elam, 1,254.

(Nehemiah 7:12) 
The descendants of Zattu, 845.

The descendants of Adonikam, 667.

(Nehemiah 7:18) 
The descendants of Bigvai, 2,067.

(Nehemiah 7:19) 
The descendants of Adin, 655.

(Nehemiah 7:20) 
The descendants of Ater, through Hezekiah, 98.

(Nehemiah 7:21) 
The descendants of Hashum, 328.

(Nehemiah 7:22) 
The descendants of Bezai, 324.

(Nehemiah 7:23) 
The descendants of Hariph, 112.

(Nehemiah 7:24) 
The descendants of Gibeon, 95.

(Nehemiah 7:25) 
The descendants of Anathoth, 128.

(Nehemiah 7:26) 
The descendants of Azmaveth, 42.

(Nehemiah 7:27) 
The descendants of Kiriath-jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth, 743.

(Nehemiah 7:28) 
The descendants of Ramah and Geba, 621.

(Nehemiah 7:29)

(Nehemiah 7:31) 
The descendants of the other Nebo, 52.

(Nehemiah 7:32) 
The descendants of the other Elam, 1,254.

(Nehemiah 7:33) 
The descendants of Harim, 320.

(Nehemiah 7:34) 
The descendants of Jericho, 345.

(Nehemiah 7:35) 
The descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 721.

(Nehemiah 7:36) 
The descendants of Senaah, 3,930.

(Nehemiah 7:37) 
The priests: The descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua, 973.

(Nehemiah 7:38) 
The descendants of Immer, 1,052.

(Nehemiah 7:39) 
The descendants of Pashhur, 1,247.

(Nehemiah 7:40) 
The descendants of Harim, 1,017.

(Nehemiah 8:1) 
So all the people gathered as one, assembling in the public square that stood before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel, for them to hear.

(Nehemiah 8:2) 
So Ezra the priest brought the Book of the Law before the assembly, including men, women, and all the children old enough to understand. He did this on the first day of the seventh month—the beginning of the civil year.

(Nehemiah 8:3) 
And Ezra read from the book aloud and clearly in the public square, before the Water Gate, from early morning until midday. He read in the presence of the men, women, and those children who were able to understand. The entire assembly listened with focused attention to the Book of the Law.

(Nehemiah 8:4) 
Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that had been built for the purpose of speaking to the assembly. Standing beside him on his right were Mattathiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. On his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

(Nehemiah 8:5) 
Ezra then opened the Book of the Law in the sight of all the people, for he was standing on the platform above everyone. As soon as he opened it, all the people rose to their feet in reverence.

(Nehemiah 8:6) 
Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God of all. And all the people responded, 'Amen, Amen,' raising their hands in agreement and praise. Then, bowing their heads, they prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground and adored the Lord.

(Nehemiah 8:7) 
Then the Levites—Joshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—ensured silence among the people so they could hear the Law. And all the people remained standing attentively.

(Nehemiah 8:8) 
They read from the Book of the Law of God, clearly explaining its meaning so the people could understand what was being read. And as they read, the people comprehended the teachings.

(Nehemiah 8:9) 
Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, along with the Levites who were instructing the people, said to everyone: 'This day is consecrated to the Lord our God. Do not mourn, and do not weep.' For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the Law, realizing their past transgressions.

(Nehemiah 8:10) 
And Nehemiah said to them: 'Go, enjoy rich foods and sweet drinks, and share some with those who have nothing prepared, for this is a holy day for our Lord. Do not be sorrowful, for the joy of the Lord is our strength and our protection.'

(Nehemiah 8:11) 
And the Levites quieted all the people, saying: 'Be silent, because this is a holy day. Do not grieve, but rejoice.'

(Nehemiah 8:12) 
So all the people went away to eat and to drink, and to share their provisions, and to rejoice with great gladness. They did this because they had understood the words that had been taught to them from the Law of God.

(Nehemiah 8:13) 
On the second day, the heads of the families of all the people, along with the priests and Levites, gathered with Ezra the scribe. They came so he could further explain the words of the Law to them, seeking deeper understanding.

(Nehemiah 8:14) 
And they found it written in the Law that the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in temporary shelters, or booths, during the solemn feast of the seventh month.

(Nehemiah 8:15) 
And that they should proclaim and make known throughout all their cities, and especially in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go out to the hill country and bring branches of olive trees, and branches of beautiful trees, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of leafy trees, so that you may make booths,' just as it is written in the Law.

(Nehemiah 8:16) 
So the people went out and brought the branches. And they made booths for themselves, each person on the roof of his house, and in their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the public square by the Water Gate, and in the square by the Gate of Ephraim.

(Nehemiah 8:17) 
Thus, the entire congregation of those who had returned from captivity made booths and lived in them. Indeed, the children of Israel had not done so in this manner since the days of Joshua the son of Nun, until that very day. And there was exceedingly great rejoicing.

(Nehemiah 8:18) 
Ezra also read from the Book of the Law of God each and every day, from the first day of the feast until the last. They celebrated the solemnity for seven days, and on the eighth day, there was a solemn assembly according to the prescribed ritual of the Law.

(Nehemiah 8:2) 
So Ezra, the priest, brought the book of the Law before the great multitude of men and women and all those who could listen and understand. This happened on the first day of the seventh month.

(Nehemiah 8:3) 
And he read from it in the public square that was in front of the Water Gate, from the early morning until midday. He read in the presence of the men and women, and those who were able to understand, and the words of the book resonated in the ears of all the people, as they listened intently.

(Nehemiah 8:4) 
Now Ezra, the scribe, stood on a wooden platform which he had made for speaking. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, to his right. And to his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

(Nehemiah 8:5) 
And Ezra opened the book before all the people, for he stood high above all of them. And when he opened it, all the people stood up in reverence.

(Nehemiah 8:6) 
And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen! Amen!" raising their hands in agreement. Then they bowed down and worshiped God with their faces to the ground.

(Nehemiah 8:7) 
Furthermore, Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, who were Levites, made the people remain silent so they would listen to the Law. And all the people remained standing in their place.

(Nehemiah 8:8) 
And they read from the book of the Law of God, explaining it distinctly and clearly so that it could be understood. And the people understood the Law as it was being read to them.

(Nehemiah 8:9) 
Then Nehemiah himself, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing all the people, said to them, "This day is consecrated to the Lord our God. Do not mourn and do not weep, for all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the Law."

(Nehemiah 8:10) 
And he said to them, "Go now, eat rich food and drink sweet wine, and send portions to those who have not prepared anything for themselves. For this day is holy to our Lord; do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is our strength."

(Nehemiah 8:11) 
And the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be silent, for this day is holy, and do not be grieved."

(Nehemiah 8:12) 
So all the people went away to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had understood the words that had been taught to them, and they were filled with joy.

(Nehemiah 8:13) 
And on the second day, the heads of the families of all the people, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered to Ezra the scribe, so that he might interpret for them more about the words of the Law.

(Nehemiah 8:14) 
And they found written in the Law, that the Lord had commanded through Moses for the children of Israel to dwell in booths during the solemn feast of the seventh month.

(Nehemiah 8:15) 
And that they should proclaim and spread the word throughout all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of beautiful trees, branches of myrtle, and palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, so that booths may be made, as it is written."

(Nehemiah 8:16) 
And the people went out and brought them. And they made booths for themselves, each one on his own housetop, and in their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim.

(Nehemiah 8:17) 
So the entire assembly of those who had returned from captivity made booths, and they dwelt in them. For the children of Israel had not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that very day. And there was great rejoicing.

(Nehemiah 8:18) 
And Ezra read from the volume of the Law of God each and every day, from the first day until the very last day of the feast. And they kept the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the prescribed custom.

(Nehemiah 9:1) 
Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month, the sons of Israel gathered together, in a state of fasting, dressed in sackcloth, and with ashes sprinkled upon them.

(Nehemiah 9:2) 
And the people of Israel separated themselves from all foreign influence and people. They then stood publicly to confess their sins, acknowledging also the grave sins of their ancestors.

(Nehemiah 9:3) 
Then the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bunni, and Chenani—stood and read aloud from the Book of the Law of their Lord God for a full quarter of the day. For another full quarter of the day, they engaged in solemn confession and fervent worship of their Lord God.

(Nehemiah 9:4) 
Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, and Chenani stood on the platform designated for the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God in prayer.

(Nehemiah 9:5) 
And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bunni, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—exhorted the people, saying, 'Stand up and bless the Lord your God, from everlasting to everlasting! May they bless Your glorious Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!'

(Nehemiah 9:6) 
You alone, O Lord, are God. You created the universe and the highest heavens, and all the celestial beings within them. You made the earth and everything upon it, the seas and everything within them. You give life to all of them, and all the celestial beings worship You.

(Nehemiah 9:7) 
You alone are the Lord God, Who chose Abram and brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and changed his name to Abraham.

(Nehemiah 9:8) 
You found his heart faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites to his descendants. And You fulfilled Your promises, because You are just.

(Nehemiah 9:9) 
You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt, and You heard their cry for help by the Red Sea.

(Nehemiah 9:10) 
And You performed great signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of that land, because You knew they had acted with arrogant cruelty against our people. Thus, You established Your Name as it is known even to this day.

(Nehemiah 9:11) 
You divided the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground. But their pursuers You cast into the depths, like a stone plunged into raging waters.

(Nehemiah 9:12) 
You were their guide by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire, to show them the way they should go.

(Nehemiah 9:13) 
You also descended upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from the sky. You gave them righteous judgments and a true law, along with good ceremonies and commandments.

(Nehemiah 9:14) 
You made Your holy Sabbath known to them, and through Your servant Moses, You commanded them to obey Your precepts, Your ceremonies, and Your Law.

(Nehemiah 9:15) 
You gave them bread from the sky in their hunger, and brought forth water from the rock for them when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go in and take possession of the land concerning which You had sworn an oath to give it to them.

(Nehemiah 9:16) 
However, they—our ancestors—acted arrogantly and stubbornly resisted Your commands, refusing to listen to Your precepts.

(Nehemiah 9:17) 
They refused to obey and did not remember the marvelous works You had done for them. They hardened their necks and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt, as if in defiance of You. But You are a God of pardon, gracious and merciful, patient, and full of great compassion, and You did not abandon them.

(Nehemiah 9:18) 
Even when they made for themselves a molten calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you up out of Egypt!'—they committed great blasphemies.

(Nehemiah 9:19) 
Yet, in Your great mercies, You did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day to lead them on the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to show them the path they should take.

(Nehemiah 9:20) 
You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water when they were thirsty.

(Nehemiah 9:21) 
For forty years You nourished them in the desert, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell or become sore.

(Nehemiah 9:22) 
You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and You allotted territories to them. They took possession of the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, the king of Bashan.

(Nehemiah 9:23) 
You multiplied their children like the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land about which You had told their ancestors they should enter and possess.

(Nehemiah 9:24) 
So the children came and possessed the land. You humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and You delivered them—their kings and the peoples of the land—into their hands, so that they could do with them as they pleased.

(Nehemiah 9:25) 
They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things: wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate, were satisfied, grew fat, and reveled in Your great abundance.

(Nehemiah 9:26) 
But they became disobedient and provoked Your anger. They cast Your Law behind their backs and murdered Your prophets who testified against them to bring them back to You. They committed great blasphemies.

(Nehemiah 9:27) 
Therefore, You delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who afflicted them. But in the time of their distress, they cried out to You, and You heard them from the sky. According to Your many mercies, You gave them saviors who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.

(Nehemiah 9:28) 
But as soon as they had rest, they returned to doing evil in Your sight. So You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, and they were subjected to them. Yet, when they turned back and cried out to You, You heard from the sky and, in Your mercies, delivered them many times.

(Nehemiah 9:29) 
You testified against them, urging them to return to Your Law. But they acted arrogantly and would not listen to Your commandments. They sinned against Your ordinances, which a person must obey to live by them. They defiantly turned their backs and stiffened their necks, refusing to listen.

(Nehemiah 9:30) 
You bore with them for many years and testified against them by Your Spirit through the hands of Your prophets. Yet, they would not listen, so You delivered them into the hands of the peoples of the lands.

(Nehemiah 9:31) 
Nevertheless, in Your abundant mercies, You did not utterly destroy them nor abandon them, for You are a gracious and merciful God.

(Nehemiah 9:32) 
Now therefore, our God, great, mighty, and terrible, Who keeps covenant and mercy, do not let all the trouble that has come upon us seem insignificant in Your sight. This trouble has afflicted our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day.

(Nehemiah 9:33) 
You are just in all that has come upon us, for You have acted faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.

(Nehemiah 9:34) 
Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow Your Law. They did not pay attention to Your commandments or to Your testimonies by which You warned them.

(Nehemiah 9:35) 
For even in their kingdoms, and despite Your great goodness that You had given them, and in the very spacious and fertile land that You had delivered before them, they did not serve You. Nor did they turn from their wicked practices.

(Nehemiah 9:36) 
Behold, we ourselves are servants today. And in the very land You gave to our ancestors, for them to eat its fruit and enjoy its good things, we ourselves are servants.

(Nehemiah 9:37) 
Its abundant produce now goes to the kings You have placed over us because of our sins. They dominate our bodies and our livestock according to their own will, and we are in great distress.

(Nehemiah 9:38) 
Because of all this, we ourselves are making a firm covenant and writing it down. Our princes, our Levites, and our priests are putting their seals upon it.

(Nehemiah 9:1) 
On the twenty-fourth day of this particular month, the children of Israel gathered together. They were engaged in fasting, dressed in sackcloth, and had ashes on their heads as a sign of repentance.

(Nehemiah 9:2) 
And the children of Israel separated themselves from all foreign people. They stood up and publicly confessed their own sins and the wickedness that their ancestors had committed.

(Nehemiah 9:3) 
Then they stood up, and for one quarter of the day they read from the book of the Law of the Lord their God. For another quarter of the day, they confessed their sins and worshipped the Lord their God.

(Nehemiah 9:4) 
Then Josue, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the platform designated for the Levites. They then cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God.

(Nehemiah 9:5) 
And the Levites—Josue, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said: “Rise up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting. May they bless Your glorious Name, which is exalted above every blessing and praise!

(Nehemiah 9:6) 
You alone are the Lord. You created the universe and all the heavens within it, with all their hosts of stars and celestial bodies. You created the earth and everything that is in it: the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly hosts worship You.

(Nehemiah 9:7) 
You, O Lord God, are the One who chose Abram. You brought him out from the Ur of the Chaldeans, which was a place of idolatry and evil. You then changed his name to Abraham.

(Nehemiah 9:8) 
You found his heart to be faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him. You promised to give him the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, and to his descendants. You kept Your promises because You are just.

(Nehemiah 9:9) 
You saw the affliction of our ancestors in Egypt. You heard their cry for help by the Red Sea.

(Nehemiah 9:10) 
You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all his land. For You knew that they had dealt proudly and oppressively against our ancestors. You made a name for Yourself that is still revered to this very day.

(Nehemiah 9:11) 
You divided the sea before them, and they passed through the middle of the sea on dry ground. But their pursuers You cast into the deep, like a stone thrown into mighty waters.

(Nehemiah 9:12) 
You led them by a pillar of cloud during the day and by a pillar of fire at night, so that You might show them the way they should go.

(Nehemiah 9:13) 
You also descended upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from the heavens. You gave them righteous judgments and the Law of truth, good statutes, and commandments.

(Nehemiah 9:14) 
You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and You commanded them precepts, statutes, and the Law through the hand of Moses, Your servant.

(Nehemiah 9:15) 
You gave them bread from the sky during their hunger, and You brought forth water for them from the rock when they were thirsty. And You told them to go in and possess the land, which You had sworn to give them by raising Your hand.

(Nehemiah 9:16) 
But they, our ancestors, acted proudly. They stiffened their necks in rebellion and refused to listen to Your commandments.

(Nehemiah 9:17) 
They refused to obey and did not remember the wonderful things You had done for them. They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt, as if through contention. But You, O God, are forgiving, gracious, and merciful. You are patient and abounding in compassion. You did not abandon them.

(Nehemiah 9:18) 
Indeed, they even made a molten calf for themselves and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' And they committed great blasphemies.

(Nehemiah 9:19) 
Yet, in Your abundant mercies, You did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day, guiding them on their way, nor did the pillar of fire by night, showing them the path they should take.

(Nehemiah 9:20) 
You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water when they were thirsty.

(Nehemiah 9:21) 
For forty years You nourished them in the desert, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.

(Nehemiah 9:22) 
You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and You allotted them territories. So they possessed the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, the king of Bashan.

(Nehemiah 9:23) 
You multiplied their children like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land of which You had told their ancestors, so that they might go in and possess it.

(Nehemiah 9:24) 
And the children came and possessed the land. You humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. You delivered the Canaanites into their hand, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, so that our ancestors might do with them as they pleased.

(Nehemiah 9:25) 
They captured fortified cities and fertile ground. They took possession of houses full of all good things, hewn cisterns, vineyards, and olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate and were satisfied. They grew fat and abounded in Your great delicacies.

(Nehemiah 9:26) 
Yet they provoked You to anger and turned away from You. They cast Your Law behind their backs and killed Your prophets who testified against them to bring them back to You. They committed great blasphemies.

(Nehemiah 9:27) 
So You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, and their enemies afflicted them. But in the time of their tribulation, they cried out to You, and You heard them from the heavens. According to Your great mercies, You gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies.

(Nehemiah 9:28) 
But when they had rest, they returned to doing evil in Your sight. So You left them in the hand of their enemies, who subjugated them. Then they turned back and cried out to You, and You heard them from the heavens. You delivered them many times through Your mercies.

(Nehemiah 9:29) 
You earnestly warned them to bring them back to Your Law. But they acted proudly and did not listen to Your commandments. They sinned against Your judgments—those judgments by which a person lives when he keeps them. They turned a rebellious shoulder, stiffened their necks, and refused to listen.

(Nehemiah 9:30) 
You bore with them for many years. You solemnly warned them by Your Spirit through the hand of Your prophets. Yet they did not listen, so You delivered them into the hands of the peoples of the lands around them.

(Nehemiah 9:31) 
Nevertheless, in Your abundant mercies, You did not utterly consume them nor did You abandon them, because You are a forgiving and merciful God.

(Nehemiah 9:32) 
Now therefore, our God, great, mighty, and awesome, You who keep covenant and mercy, do not let all the hardship that has come upon us seem insignificant in Your sight. It has come upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day.

(Nehemiah 9:33) 
You are just in all that has come upon us, for You have acted faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.

(Nehemiah 9:34) 
Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow Your Law. They paid no attention to Your commandments or to Your warnings that You gave them.

(Nehemiah 9:35) 
Even in their own kingdoms, and despite Your abundant goodness that You gave them, and in the very broad and rich land which You delivered before them, they did not serve You. They did not turn from their wicked practices.

(Nehemiah 9:36) 
Behold, we ourselves are servants today. In the land that You gave to our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good things, we ourselves are now servants within it.

(Nehemiah 9:37) 
Its abundant produce now goes to the kings whom You have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and our livestock according to their own will, and we are in great tribulation.

(Nehemiah 9:38) 
Therefore, concerning all these things, we ourselves are making a solemn covenant and writing it down. Our princes, our Levites, and our priests are putting their seals upon it.

(Nehemiah 9:39) 
Those who signed were Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah.

(Nehemiah 9:40) 
Also Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, Harim, Baanah, Meremoth, Obadiah, Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah. These were the priests who signed the covenant.

(Nehemiah 10:26) 
Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,

(Nehemiah 10:27) 
Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

(Nehemiah 10:28) 
And the rest of the people—the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants—and everyone who had separated themselves from the foreign peoples of the land to follow God's law, along with their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all who had understanding—

(Nehemiah 10:29) 
They joined with their more prominent kinsmen, and solemnly bound themselves by a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which He had given through His servant Moses. They swore to observe and perform all the commandments of the Lord our God, along with His judgments and His ritual practices.

(Nehemiah 10:30) 
They also swore that they would not give their daughters in marriage to the foreign peoples of the land, nor would they take the daughters of these peoples as wives for their sons.

(Nehemiah 10:31) 
They further agreed that if the foreign peoples of the land were to bring goods or any food for sale on the Sabbath or on any other holy day, they would not buy anything from them. They also committed to observing the Sabbath year—the seventh year—by letting the land rest, and they would forgive every debt owed to them.

(Nehemiah 10:32) 
We also imposed ordinances upon ourselves to contribute a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God.

(Nehemiah 10:33) 
This contribution was for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering, for the Sabbaths and new moon festivals, for all the consecrated offerings, for the firstfruits of the sanctuary, for the sin offerings to make atonement for all Israel, and for all the necessary services of the house of our God.

(Nehemiah 10:34) 
We also cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people to determine the schedule for bringing the wood offering to the house of our God. Each ancestral house would bring its portion at appointed times each year on specified days, so that it could be burned upon the altar of the Lord our God, just as it is written in the law of Moses.

(Nehemiah 10:35) 
And we agreed to bring the firstfruits of our land and the firstfruits of all the produce from every tree, year after year, to the house of the Lord.

(Nehemiah 10:36) 
And we committed to bringing the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, as well as the firstborn of our oxen and our sheep. These offerings are to be brought to the house of our God, to the priests who minister there.

(Nehemiah 10:37) 
We also agreed to bring the firstfruits of our ground grain, our drink offerings, the fruit from every tree, the new wine, and the oil to the priests, to be stored in the storerooms of the house of our God. And we would bring a tenth of our land's produce to the Levites. The Levites themselves are to collect the tithes from all the cities where we farm.

(Nehemiah 10:38) 
A priest, a son of Aaron, must be present with the Levites when the Levites collect the tithes. And the Levites, in turn, must bring a tenth of their collected tithes to the house of our God, to be placed in the storerooms of the treasury.

(Nehemiah 10:39) 
For to these storerooms, the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi are to bring the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, and oil. There, the vessels of the sanctuary are to be kept, and the priests who minister, along with the singers and the gatekeepers, are to be present. In this way, we declared that we would not neglect the house of our God.

(Nehemiah 11:1) 
The leaders of the people had already settled in Jerusalem. For the remaining population, lots were cast so that one out of every ten people would come to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine out of ten would remain in their respective towns.

(Nehemiah 11:2) 
The people blessed all those men who willingly volunteered to live in Jerusalem.

(Nehemiah 11:3) 
These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem and in the other cities of Judah, each in his own inherited land and his own town. These included Israelites, priests, Levites, the Nethinim, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.

(Nehemiah 11:4) 
In Jerusalem, some descendants of Judah and Benjamin took up residence. From the descendants of Judah, there was Athaiah, whose lineage traced back through Azariah, Zechariah, Amariah, Shephatiah, and Mahalalel, all of the family of Perez.

(Nehemiah 11:5) 
Also from Judah, there was Maaseiah, son of Baruch, whose line went through Col-Hozeh, Hazaiah, Adaiah, Joiarib, and Zechariah, from the family of the Shilonites.

(Nehemiah 11:6) 
All the descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem numbered four hundred and sixty-eight strong, capable men.

(Nehemiah 11:7) 
From the descendants of Benjamin, there was Sallu, son of Meshullam, whose ancestry included Joed, Pedaiah, Kolaiah, Maaseiah, Ithiel, and Jeshaiah.

(Nehemiah 11:8) 
And following him were Gabbai and Sallai, totaling nine hundred and twenty-eight men from Benjamin.

(Nehemiah 11:9) 
Joel, son of Zichri, was appointed as their overseer. And Judah, son of Senuah, held the position of second in command over the city.

(Nehemiah 11:10) 
Now for the priests: Jedaiah, son of Joiarib, and Jachin.

(Nehemiah 11:11) 
Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, whose line included Meshullam, Zadok, Meraiah, and Ahitub, served as the chief minister for the house of God, meaning the Temple.

(Nehemiah 11:12) 
And their brethren, who performed the work in the Temple, numbered eight hundred and twenty-two. There was also Adaiah, son of Jeroham, whose ancestry traced through Pedaiah, Amzi, Zechariah, Pashhur, and Malchijah.

(Nehemiah 11:13) 
And his brethren, who were the leaders of their ancestral houses, numbered two hundred and forty-two. There was also Amashsai, son of Azarel, whose lineage included Ahzai, Meshillemoth, and Immer.

(Nehemiah 11:14) 
And his brethren, mighty and strong men, numbered one hundred and twenty-eight. Their overseer was Zabdiel, who was a son of the notable men, meaning a prominent family.

(Nehemiah 11:15) 
Now for the Levites: Shemaiah, son of Hasshub, whose ancestry traced through Azrikam, Hashabiah, and Bunni.

(Nehemiah 11:16) 
And Shabbethai and Jozabad were appointed as overseers of the Levites, specifically for the tasks and duties outside the Temple of God.

(Nehemiah 11:17) 
And Mattaniah, son of Micah, whose line went through Zabdi and Asaph, was the chief leader in offering praise and giving thanks in prayer. Bakbukiah was his second in command among his brethren. There was also Abda, son of Shammua, whose lineage included Galal and Jeduthun.

(Nehemiah 11:18) 
All the Levites who resided in the holy city totaled two hundred and eighty-four.

(Nehemiah 11:19) 
And the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, who were responsible for guarding the gates, numbered one hundred and seventy-two.

(Nehemiah 11:20) 
The rest of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, remained in all the other cities of Judah, each in his own inherited land.

(Nehemiah 11:21) 
The Nethinim, however, lived in the Ophel district. Ziha and Gishpa were prominent among the Nethinim.

(Nehemiah 11:22) 
The chief overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi, son of Bani, whose lineage included Hashabiah, Mattaniah, and Micah. He was from the descendants of Asaph, who were the Temple singers responsible for their duties in the House of God.

(Nehemiah 11:23) 
This arrangement was in place because there was a direct royal decree concerning them, ensuring that the Temple singers received a fixed daily provision for their work.

(Nehemiah 11:24) 
Pethahiah, son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah from the tribe of Judah, served as the king's personal representative, handling all matters concerning the people.

(Nehemiah 11:25) 
In the villages and rural areas of their ancestral lands, some descendants of Judah lived in Kiriath-Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its surrounding settlements, and in Kabzeel and its surrounding settlements.

Zanoah, Adullam, and their surrounding settlements; Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its surrounding settlements. Their settlements extended from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom.

(Nehemiah 11:31) 
The descendants of Benjamin, however, settled in Geba, Michmash, Ai, and Bethel, along with their surrounding settlements.

(Nehemiah 11:32) 
They also settled in Anathoth, Nob, and Anania.

(Nehemiah 11:33) 
And in Hazor, Ramah, and Gittaim.

(Nehemiah 11:34) 
And in Hadid, Zeboim, and Neballat.

(Nehemiah 11:35) 
And in Lod and Ono, which was known as the Valley of Craftsmen.

(Nehemiah 11:36) 
And concerning the Levites, some were assigned to the portions of Judah and Benjamin, to serve among them.

(Nehemiah 12:22) 
The Levites, during the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as heads of families. The priests were also recorded during the reign of Darius the Persian.

(Nehemiah 12:23) 
The sons of Levi, the heads of families, were recorded in the book of the chronicles up to the time of Jonathan, the son of Eliashib.

(Nehemiah 12:24) 
The leading Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua, the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers, who stood opposite them in their assigned sections to offer praise and thanksgiving, according to the command of David, the man of God, keeping watch in opposing shifts.

(Nehemiah 12:25) 
Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers, guarding the storerooms at the gates.

(Nehemiah 12:26) 
These served in the days of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.

(Nehemiah 12:27) 
At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they diligently sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with joy and thanksgiving, with songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.

(Nehemiah 12:28) 
So the descendants of the singers gathered themselves from the countryside around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites.

(Nehemiah 12:29) 
They came from Beth Gilgal and from the regions of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves all around Jerusalem.

(Nehemiah 12:30) 
The priests and Levites first purified themselves; then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.

(Nehemiah 12:31) 
Then I made the leaders of Judah go up on the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give thanks. One procession went to the right, along the wall, toward the Dung Gate.

(Nehemiah 12:32) 
And behind them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah.

(Nehemiah 12:33) 
Also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.

(Nehemiah 12:34) 
And some of the sons of the priests with trumpets, including Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph.

(Nehemiah 12:35) 
And his brothers: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe walked before them.

(Nehemiah 12:36) 
At the Fountain Gate, they continued directly forward, ascending the steps of the City of David, up the ascent of the wall above the house of David, and as far as the Water Gate on the east.

(Nehemiah 12:37) 
The second choir of thanksgiving went in the opposite direction, and I followed it with half of the people, along the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens, and as far as the Broad Wall.

(Nehemiah 12:38) 
They continued above the Gate of Ephraim, and above the Old Gate, and above the Fish Gate, and the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they halted at the Guard Gate.

(Nehemiah 12:39) 
Then the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim took their positions in all the cities of Judah and in Jerusalem.

(Nehemiah 12:40) 
And the priests and Levites rejoiced on that day, and they sang a great song, with their choir performing in all the cities of Judah and in Jerusalem.

(Nehemiah 13:1) 
In those days, a passage was read aloud from the book of Moses for all the people to hear. It was discovered to be written in it that the Ammonites and Moabites were not permitted to enter the assembly of God, and were to be excluded forever.

(Nehemiah 13:2) 
The reason for this prohibition was that these nations did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water when Israel was journeying through their lands. Moreover, they hired Balaam to curse Israel, but our God turned that curse into a blessing.

(Nehemiah 13:3) 
So it came to pass that when they heard this law, they immediately separated all foreigners from among Israel.

(Nehemiah 13:4) 
Now, before these events, Eliasib the priest, who was in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God, had become allied with Tobia.

(Nehemiah 13:5) 
This Eliasib had prepared a large storeroom for Tobia, a place where they had previously kept the treasures, incense, vessels, the tithe of grain, wine, and oil (which were the portions for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers), and also the priestly first-fruits.

(Nehemiah 13:6) 
During all these events, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon, I had gone to the king. After some time, I requested leave from the king to return.

(Nehemiah 13:7) 
So I came to Jerusalem. When I arrived, I understood the great evil that Eliasib had done for Tobia, by allowing him to have a storeroom prepared in the outer court of the house of the Lord.

(Nehemiah 13:8) 
This action seemed extremely wicked to me. So I immediately threw all of Tobia's household goods out of that storeroom.

(Nehemiah 13:9) 
I then gave orders, and they purified the storerooms. After this, I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, along with the incense and the oil for sacred use.

(Nehemiah 13:10) 
I also learned that the portions due to the Levites had not been given to them. Because of this, every one of the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers had fled back to his own land, unable to perform their duties.

(Nehemiah 13:11) 
So I confronted the magistrates and rebuked them, saying, "Why have we abandoned the house of God and neglected its servants?" Then I gathered the Levites and their fellow workers and restored them to their proper stations and responsibilities.

(Nehemiah 13:12) 
After this, all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, wine, and oil into the storerooms of the temple.

(Nehemiah 13:13) 
We then appointed treasurers over these storerooms: Sellemian the priest, Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaia from the Levites. Alongside these, we appointed Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mathania. These men were chosen because they had proven themselves faithful, and to them was entrusted the responsibility of distributing the portions to their brothers.

(Nehemiah 13:14) 
My God, remember me for these actions. Do not erase the merciful deeds I have performed for the house of my God and for its sacred services.

(Nehemiah 13:15) 
In those days, I saw people in Judah pressing wine in the winepresses on the Sabbath day. Others were bringing in sheaves of grain, wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, and they were bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I sternly warned them against selling food and other goods on that holy day.

(Nehemiah 13:16) 
Even the Tyrians who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all sorts of merchandise. They were selling these goods to the children of Judah and within Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.

(Nehemiah 13:17) 
I therefore rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, by profaning the Sabbath day in such a way?"

(Nehemiah 13:18) 
"Did not your fathers do the very same things? And because of that, our God brought all this terrible evil upon us and upon this city. Now you are adding to God's wrath against Israel by violating the Sabbath."

(Nehemiah 13:19) 
So it came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to grow dark before the Sabbath, I ordered them to be shut. I commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath had passed. I also stationed some of my own servants at the gates, so that no burden could be brought in on the Sabbath day.

(Nehemiah 13:20) 
Once or twice, the merchants and those who sold all sorts of wares camped outside Jerusalem, waiting for the Sabbath to end.

(Nehemiah 13:21) 
But I warned them strongly, saying, "Why do you remain camping opposite the wall? If you do this a second time, I will lay hands on you with force." From that time onward, they stopped coming to Jerusalem on the Sabbath.

(Nehemiah 13:22) 
I also commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to come and guard the gates, so that they might keep the Sabbath day holy. For this action too, remember me, my God, and spare me according to the abundance of your mercies.

(Nehemiah 13:23) 
In those days, I also saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.

(Nehemiah 13:24) 
Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of each people they were mixed with.

(Nehemiah 13:25) 
So I confronted them, and I cursed them. I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I then made them swear an oath by God, promising that they would not give their daughters to the sons of these foreign women, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:

(Nehemiah 13:26) 
"Was it not because of such practices that Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned? Among many nations, there was no king like him; he was beloved by his God, and our God made him king over all Israel. Yet even he was led into transgression by foreign women."

(Nehemiah 13:27) 
"Are we then to hear about you doing all this great evil, committing a transgression against our God by marrying foreign women?"

(Nehemiah 13:28) 
One of the sons of Jojada, the son of Eliasib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanaballat the Horonite. I chased this man away from me, expelling him from the community.

(Nehemiah 13:29) 
My God, remember those who defile the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and the Levites.

(Nehemiah 13:30) 
So I cleansed them from all foreign influence and practices. I then established the proper divisions for the priests and the Levites, appointing each one to his own ministry and duties.

(Nehemiah 13:31) 
I also made sure that provisions were made for the offering of wood and the first-fruits, each at their appointed times. My God, remember me for good in all these things.
