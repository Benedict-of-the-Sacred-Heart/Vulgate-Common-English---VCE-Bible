(1 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the command of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope,

(1 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, a beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.

(1 Timothy 1:3) 
As I requested you to stay in Ephesus, on my way to Macedonia, so that you would command certain people not to teach differently,

(1 Timothy 1:4) 
nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which give rise to disputes, rather than to the edification of God, which is in faith.

(1 Timothy 1:5) 
Now the goal of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.

(1 Timothy 1:6) 
From these things some, having strayed, are turned aside to vain speech,

(1 Timothy 1:7) 
desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor the things concerning which they make affirmation.

(1 Timothy 1:8) 
But we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully:

(1 Timothy 1:9) 
knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the impious and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers,

(1 Timothy 1:10) 
fornicators, those who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if there is anything else that goes against sound doctrine;

(1 Timothy 1:11) 
according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was entrusted to me.

(1 Timothy 1:12) 
And I give thanks to him who has strengthened me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, because he has judged me faithful, putting me into the ministry,

(1 Timothy 1:13) 
who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.

(1 Timothy 1:14) 
And the grace of our Lord abounded with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 1:15) 
Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

(1 Timothy 1:16) 
But for this reason I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth all patience, for the example of those who would believe in him unto life everlasting.

(1 Timothy 1:17) 
Now to the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(1 Timothy 1:18) 
This charge I commit to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,

(1 Timothy 1:19) 
holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having thrust aside, have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith.

(1 Timothy 1:20) 
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

(1 Timothy 2:1) 
I ask, then, that, first of all, that there be prayers of supplication, prayers of petition, and thanksgiving offered for all people:

(1 Timothy 2:2) 
Pray for those in authority, and all those who govern, so that we may live a calm and tranquil life, with all piety and chastity.

(1 Timothy 2:3) 
This is good, and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior,

(1 Timothy 2:4) 
Who wills all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

(1 Timothy 2:5) 
For there is only one God, and only one mediator between God and humankind, the man Christ Jesus:

(1 Timothy 2:6) 
Who gave Himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in his own time:

(1 Timothy 2:7) 
I, Paul, have been placed as a herald, and an apostle—I speak the truth and do not lie—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

(1 Timothy 2:8) 
I want, therefore, men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger or quarreling.

(1 Timothy 2:9) 
Likewise, women should adorn themselves in modest apparel, with decency and moderation, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly clothes,

(1 Timothy 2:10) 
but with good works, as befits women who profess godliness.

(1 Timothy 2:11) 
Let a woman learn in silence, with all subjection.

(1 Timothy 2:12) 
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.

(1 Timothy 2:13) 
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

(1 Timothy 2:14) 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

(1 Timothy 2:15) 
But she will be saved through childbirth, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with moderation.

(1 Timothy 3:1) 
This is a true statement: If a man desires to be a bishop, he is reaching for an honorable work.

(1 Timothy 3:2) 
A bishop, therefore, must be above reproach, he must be a one-woman man, sober, prudent, respectable, chaste, hospitable, and able to teach,

(1 Timothy 3:3) 
not a drunkard or a brawler, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy,

(1 Timothy 3:4) 
one who manages his own household well, with his children in submission with all dignity.

(1 Timothy 3:5) 
(For if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)

(1 Timothy 3:6) 
He must not be a recent convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and fall into the devil's judgment.

(1 Timothy 3:7) 
Moreover, he must have a good reputation with those outside the Church, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil's snare.

(1 Timothy 3:8) 
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for sordid gain.

(1 Timothy 3:9) 
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.

(1 Timothy 3:10) 
Let these also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.

(1 Timothy 3:11) 
Women, in like manner, must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober and trustworthy in everything.

(1 Timothy 3:12) 
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, and let them manage their children and their own households well.

(1 Timothy 3:13) 
For those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

(1 Timothy 3:14) 
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon,

(1 Timothy 3:15) 
but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.

(1 Timothy 3:16) 
And without doubt, the mystery of godliness is great: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.

(1 Timothy 4:1) 
The Spirit clearly says that in the final days, some will abandon the faith, listening to the spirits of error and the teachings of demons.

(1 Timothy 4:2) 
They will be deceivers, and their consciences will be seared.

(1 Timothy 4:3) 
They will forbid marriage and tell people to abstain from certain foods. God created these foods to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

(1 Timothy 4:4) 
Everything God made is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving:

(1 Timothy 4:5) 
It is made holy by the word of God and prayer.

(1 Timothy 4:6) 
By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of the faith and the good teaching that you have followed.

(1 Timothy 4:7) 
But reject profane and old wives' tales, and train yourself to be a man of faith.

(1 Timothy 4:8) 
Physical training has some value, but faith is valuable in every way. It promises life now and in the future.

(1 Timothy 4:9) 
This is a faithful saying, worthy of all acceptance.

(1 Timothy 4:10) 
We work hard and suffer insults for this, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.

(1 Timothy 4:11) 
Command and teach these things.

(1 Timothy 4:12) 
Let no one look down on your youth. Instead, be an example for the believers in your speech, in your conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.

(1 Timothy 4:13) 
Until I come, focus on reading the Scriptures, exhorting others, and teaching.

(1 Timothy 4:14) 
Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.

(1 Timothy 4:15) 
Meditate on these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.

(1 Timothy 4:16) 
Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in them, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

(1 Timothy 5:1) 
Never scold an older man, but instead implore him as if he were your own father. Treat younger men as brothers.

(1 Timothy 5:2) 
Treat older women as mothers. Treat younger women as sisters—in all purity.

(1 Timothy 5:3) 
Give honor to widows who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:4) 
If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to manage their own household and to repay their parents and grandparents; for this is acceptable before God.

(1 Timothy 5:5) 
Now, she who is truly a widow, and desolate, hopes in God, and persists in prayers night and day.

(1 Timothy 5:6) 
But she who is self-indulgent is dead while she lives.

(1 Timothy 5:7) 
Give these instructions, so that they may be blameless.

(1 Timothy 5:8) 
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

(1 Timothy 5:9) 
Let a widow be chosen if she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband,

(1 Timothy 5:10) 
having a testimony of good works: if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.

(1 Timothy 5:11) 
But refuse younger widows. For when they have grown luxurious against Christ, they want to marry,

(1 Timothy 5:12) 
having condemnation, because they have set aside their first faith.

(1 Timothy 5:13) 
At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things which they ought not.

(1 Timothy 5:14) 
Therefore, I want younger women to marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity for reproach.

(1 Timothy 5:15) 
For some have already turned aside after Satan.

(1 Timothy 5:16) 
If any believing man or woman has widows, let them provide for them, and let not the Church be burdened, so that it may suffice for those who are truly widows.

(1 Timothy 5:17) 
Let the presbyters who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in doctrine.

(1 Timothy 5:18) 
For the Scripture says: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”

(1 Timothy 5:19) 
Do not receive an accusation against a presbyter, except under two or three witnesses.

(1 Timothy 5:20) 
Those who sin, rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.

(1 Timothy 5:21) 
I solemnly charge you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality.

(1 Timothy 5:22) 
Lay hands on no one hastily, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself chaste.

(1 Timothy 5:23) 
No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach, and your frequent infirmities.

(1 Timothy 5:24) 
The sins of some men are evident, preceding them to judgment, while the sins of others follow them.

(1 Timothy 5:25) 
Likewise, the good works are evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

(1 Timothy 6:1) 
Those who are slaves must consider their masters worthy of all honor. This is to prevent the name of God and His teaching from being dishonored.

(1 Timothy 6:2) 
Those who have faithful masters shouldn't despise them because they are brothers. Instead, they should serve even more diligently, because those masters are faithful and beloved and share in the benefit of Christ. Teach these things, and urge them upon others.

(1 Timothy 6:3) 
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not adhere to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching that accords with true devotion,

(1 Timothy 6:4) 
he is conceited and knows nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and quarrels about words. These disputes produce envy, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,

(1 Timothy 6:5) 
and the wrangling of people who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Stay away from such people.

(1 Timothy 6:6) 
But godliness with contentment is great gain.

(1 Timothy 6:7) 
For we brought nothing into this world, and we cannot take anything out of it.

(1 Timothy 6:8) 
But if we have food and clothing, with these things we should be content.

(1 Timothy 6:9) 
Those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

(1 Timothy 6:10) 
For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some, yearning for, have gone astray from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

(1 Timothy 6:11) 
But you, man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

(1 Timothy 6:12) 
Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called and made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.

(1 Timothy 6:13) 
I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate,

(1 Timothy 6:14) 
to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Timothy 6:15) 
which He will manifest at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

(1 Timothy 6:16) 
who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.

(1 Timothy 6:17) 
Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.

(1 Timothy 6:18) 
Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,

(1 Timothy 6:19) 
storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.

(1 Timothy 6:20) 
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge.

(1 Timothy 6:21) 
By professing such knowledge, some have gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
