(Jeremiah 1:1) 
These are the prophetic words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, who was one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.

(Jeremiah 1:2) 
The Word of the Lord first came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah.

(Jeremiah 1:3) 
It continued through the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, and lasted until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, when Jerusalem was carried away into exile during the fifth month — this was the full duration of his prophetic ministry.

(Jeremiah 1:4) 
Then the Word of the Lord came directly to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 1:5) 
“Before I created your physical form in your mother’s womb, I knew you. And before you were born, I consecrated you to My service, appointing you as a prophet to all the nations.”

(Jeremiah 1:6) 
But I said: “Oh, Lord God! I cannot speak for You, for I am but a youth and I don’t know what to say.”

(Jeremiah 1:7) 
But the Lord said to me: “Do not say, ‘I am a youth.’ For wherever I send you, you shall go, and everything I command you to say, you shall speak.

(Jeremiah 1:8) 
Do not be afraid of anyone’s presence, because I Myself am with you to deliver you,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 1:9) 
Then the Lord stretched out His hand and touched my mouth — an act of divine commissioning and empowerment. And the Lord said to me: “Behold, I have now put My very own words in your mouth.

(Jeremiah 1:10) 
Look! Today I have given you authority over nations and over kingdoms. You are to uproot nations, tear them down, destroy them, and overthrow them through your prophecies. And you are also to build up and to plant new beginnings through your prophecies.”

(Jeremiah 1:11) 
Then the Word of the Lord came to me again, saying: “Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I answered: “I see an almond branch” — the first tree to wake and blossom in spring, symbolizing God’s watchful readiness.

(Jeremiah 1:12) 
And the Lord said to me: “You have seen well! For I Myself will be watchful over My word to ensure that I perform it.”

(Jeremiah 1:13) 
The Word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying: “What do you see now?” And I said: “I see a boiling pot, and its mouth is tilted from the north,” indicating the direction from which the judgment will come.

(Jeremiah 1:14) 
Then the Lord said to me: “Calamity and evil will be unleashed from the north upon all the inhabitants of this land.

(Jeremiah 1:15) 
For behold, I am summoning all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” declares the Lord. “And they will come, and each one will set his royal throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem. They will also attack all its surrounding walls and all the cities of Judah.”

(Jeremiah 1:16) 
I will then pronounce My judgments against them for all their wickedness. They abandoned Me, offered libations to foreign gods, and worshipped the idols made by their own hands.

(Jeremiah 1:17) 
Therefore, you, Jeremiah, must prepare yourself for action. Arise and speak to them everything that I command you. Do not be afraid of their presence or dread their faces,

(Jeremiah 1:18) 
“—for behold, I have made you today like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall against the entire land — against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land.

(Jeremiah 1:19) 
They will fight against you, but they will not prevail over you, because I am with you,” declares the Lord, “to deliver you from them.”

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:2) 
Go and proclaim to Jerusalem, saying: The Lord declares: "I remember your devotion from when you were young, and the great love you had for Me when we were first espoused. You followed Me through the wilderness, through land that was not cultivated."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:3) 
Israel was consecrated to the Lord, the very firstfruits of His harvest. Anyone who tried to destroy Israel was found guilty and brought disaster upon themselves, the Lord declares.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:4) 
Listen to the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families within the house of Israel:

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:5) 
The Lord declares: "What injustice did your ancestors find in Me that made them abandon Me? They pursued empty idols and became empty themselves."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:6) 
They did not ask: "Where is the Lord who brought us up from the land of Egypt? Where is the One who led us through the wilderness—through a desolate and impassable land, through a land of drought and the shadow of death, a land where no one journeyed and no human dwelled?"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:7) 
I brought you into a fertile land—a garden paradise—to enjoy its fruits and its goodness. But when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:8) 
Even the priests did not ask: "Where is the Lord?" Those who were supposed to teach the Law did not truly know Me. The leaders of the people rebelled against Me. The prophets spoke in the name of Baal and pursued worthless idols.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:9) 
Therefore, I will again bring a charge against you, declares the Lord. I will contend with your children's children, and they will answer for your sins.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:10) 
Cross over to the coasts of the Cypriots and observe! Send messengers to Kedar and carefully consider if anything like this has ever happened!

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:11) 
Has any nation ever changed its gods, even though those gods are not real? Yet My people have exchanged their true glory—Me—for an idol that brings no benefit.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:12) 
Be utterly shocked, O universe, at this! Look with horror and be completely devastated, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:13) 
For My people have committed two great evils: they have abandoned Me, the very spring of life-giving water, and they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:14) 
Is Israel a slave? Or was he born into slavery? Why then has he become prey to his enemies?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:15) 
Lions have roared over him; they have raised their voices in triumph. They have made his land a desolate wasteland. His cities have been burned to ashes, and no one lives in them.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:16) 
Even the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes—the Egyptians—have utterly disgraced you. They have shaved your head bare, taking away your dignity.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:17) 
Did this not happen to you because you abandoned the Lord your God, at the very time He was leading you on your path?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:18) 
And now, what do you want for yourself on the way to Egypt, that you may drink the muddy waters of the Shihor? And what good will it do you on the way to Assyria, that you may drink the waters of the Nile?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:19) 
Your own wickedness will punish you, and your turning away will condemn you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to abandon the Lord your God, and that you have no reverent fear of Me, declares the Lord God of all creation.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:20) 
Long ago, you broke My yoke and tore off My bonds, declaring: "I will not serve You!" Indeed, on every high hill and under every leafy tree, you prostrated yourself like a prostitute.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:21) 
I Myself planted you as a choice vine, an entirely true seed. How then have you turned into a degenerate, wild vine in My sight?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:22) 
Even if you wash yourself with soda and use much lye soap, the stain of your guilt remains before Me, declares the Lord God.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:23) 
How can you say: "I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals"? Look at your ways in the valley, understand what you have done! You are like a swift, restive young camel, running aimlessly.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:24) 
You are like a wild ass, accustomed to the wilderness, snorting for passion in her desire. Who can turn her away from her lust? All who seek her will find her when she is in heat.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:25) 
You try to hold your foot back from running bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said: "It's hopeless! No, I have loved foreign gods, and after them I will go!"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:26) 
Just as a thief is put to shame when he is caught, so the house of Israel will be put to shame—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:27) 
They say to a wooden idol: "You are my father," and to a stone idol: "You gave birth to me." They have turned their backs to Me, not their faces. But in the time of their affliction, they will say: "Arise and deliver us!"

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:28) 
Where are your gods that you made for yourselves? Let them rise up and deliver you in your time of affliction! For you have as many gods, O Judah, as you have cities.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:29) 
Why do you want to bring a charge against Me? You have all abandoned Me, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:30) 
In vain I struck your children; they did not accept correction. Your own sword devoured your prophets, like a devastating lion.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:31) 
O generation, consider the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land that yields nothing? Why then do My people say: "We have broken free; we will not come to You any more"?

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:32) 
Can a virgin forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding dress? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:33) 
How skillfully you prepare your path to pursue your lovers! So much so that you have taught even the wicked women your evil ways.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:34) 
Even on your clothes, the blood of innocent, poor people is found. You did not catch them breaking into your house; their blood was openly shed for all to see.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:35) 
Yet you say: "I am innocent; surely His anger has turned away from me." Behold, I will bring a charge against you because you insist: "I have not sinned."

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:36) 
How contemptible you have made yourself, so readily changing your paths! You will be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were disappointed by Assyria.

(Jeremiah 2:Jeremiah 2:37) 
Even from there you will go forth with your hands on your head in shame, for the Lord has rejected those you trusted, and you will find no help from them.

(Jeremiah 3:1) 
They have a saying: 'If a man divorces his wife, and that divorced woman marries another man, will she ever return to him? Wouldn't that woman be defiled and stained forever?' Yet you, O Israel, have committed spiritual adultery with many false lovers; nevertheless, return to Me, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:2) 
Look up to the barren heights and see where you have not prostituted yourself. You sat by the roadsides, waiting for your lovers, like a highwayman ambushing in the desert, and the land has been defiled by your spiritual adultery and your wickedness.

(Jeremiah 3:3) 
Because of this, the early rains were withheld, and there was no spring rain. You have taken on the shameless face of a harlot; you refused to be ashamed of your sins.

(Jeremiah 3:4) 
Even now you call out to Me, saying: 'My Father, You were the guide of my youth, the One who led me in purity.'

(Jeremiah 3:5) 
Will God be angry forever? Will His wrath endure to the very end? This is what you say, but you continued to do all the evil things you possibly could.

(Jeremiah 3:6) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying: 'Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has gone up to every high mountain and under every green tree, practicing spiritual prostitution there.'

(Jeremiah 3:7) 
And I thought: 'After she has done all these things, she will surely return to Me.' But she did not return to Me. And her treacherous sister, Judah, saw all this.

(Jeremiah 3:8) 
I saw that because unfaithful Israel had committed spiritual adultery, I had divorced her and given her a certificate of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid to do the same, but she too went and acted like a prostitute.

(Jeremiah 3:9) 
And with utter disregard, she committed her spiritual adultery. She defiled the land by committing adultery with idols of stone and wood.

(Jeremiah 3:10) 
And in spite of all these warnings, treacherous Judah did not return to Me with her whole heart, but only pretended to repent, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:11) 
Then the Lord said to me: 'Apostate Israel has proven herself more righteous than treacherous Judah by comparison.'

(Jeremiah 3:12) 
Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: 'Return, apostate Israel!' declares the Lord. 'I will not look on you with anger, for I am merciful,' declares the Lord, 'and I will not remain angry forever.'

(Jeremiah 3:13) 
'Only acknowledge your guilt—that you have rebelled against the Lord your God, and have given your love to foreign gods under every green tree, and have not obeyed My voice,' declares the Lord your God.

(Jeremiah 3:14) 
Return, O wayward children!' declares the Lord, 'for I am your true husband. I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and bring you to My holy mountain, Zion.'

(Jeremiah 3:15) 
And I will give you shepherds who follow My heart, and they will nourish you with true knowledge and sound teaching.

(Jeremiah 3:16) 
And in those days, when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land,' declares the Lord, 'people will no longer speak of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. It will not come to mind, nor will they remember it or miss it; no new one will be made.'

(Jeremiah 3:17) 
At that time, Jerusalem will be called 'The Throne of the Lord.' And all nations will gather there, to Jerusalem, in the name of the Lord, and they will no longer follow the stubborn evil of their hearts.

(Jeremiah 3:18) 
In those days, the house of Judah will unite with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave to your fathers as an inheritance and a place of rest.

(Jeremiah 3:19) 
But I myself said, 'How will I adopt you as My children and give you a desirable land, a glorious heritage among the nations?' And I said, 'You will call Me 'My Father' and will not turn away from following Me.'

(Jeremiah 3:20) 
But just as a wife proves faithless to her husband, so have you, O house of Israel, been unfaithful to Me,' declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 3:21) 
A sound is heard on the barren heights—the weeping and cries for mercy of the children of Israel, because they have corrupted their ways and forgotten the Lord their God.

(Jeremiah 3:22) 
'Return, you wayward children, and I will heal your waywardness.' And they answer: 'Here we are! We come to You, for You are the Lord our God!'

(Jeremiah 3:23) 
Surely, the worship on the multitude of hills and the clamor on the mountains were deceptive and vain. Truly, in the Lord our God alone is the salvation of Israel.

(Jeremiah 3:24) 
And shame has covered what we worshipped on the mountains since our youth: their names, their silver, their gold, their wood, and their stones—all the idols we made.

(Jeremiah 3:25) 
We must lie down in our shame, and our disgrace will cover us. For we have sinned against the Lord our God, both we and our fathers, from our youth even to this very day, and we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God.

(Jeremiah 4:4:1) 
“If you truly return, O Israel,” says the Lord, “you must turn back to Me completely. And if you remove all your idols from My sight, then you will not be disturbed or cast away.

(Jeremiah 4:4:2) 
Then you will solemnly swear: ‘As the Lord lives!’ and you will do so truthfully, justly, and righteously. And then, the nations who observe this will bless Him, and find their own praise and honor in Him.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:3) 
For this is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your uncultivated land. Prepare your hearts for a new beginning. Do not sow among thorns, which will choke out any good seed.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:4) 
Circumcise yourselves spiritually for the Lord. Remove the foreskins of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Do this lest My righteous indignation go forth like a fire and burn so fiercely that no one can extinguish it, all because of the evil practices and pursuits you continue.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:5) 
“Announce this throughout Judah and make it heard in Jerusalem! Speak up! Blow the trumpet in the land! Shout urgently and declare: ‘Gather together! Let us retreat into the fortified cities for protection!’”

(Jeremiah 4:4:6) 
“Raise a warning flag in Zion! Brace yourselves! Do not stand still or hesitate, because I am bringing disaster from the north, a great and terrible destruction.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:7) 
A lion has come up from his lair—a destructive enemy, the plunderer of nations, has been stirred up. He has left his place to make your land a wasteland. Your cities will be devastated, and no one will live in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:8) 
Because of this coming disaster, put on sackcloth. Mourn deeply and wail aloud, for the Lord’s fierce anger has indeed turned against us.

(Jeremiah 4:4:9) 
“And it will happen on that day,” says the Lord, “that the king’s courage will fail, and the princes’ resolve will collapse. The priests will be utterly astonished, and the prophets will be amazed and confounded.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:10) 
Then I, Jeremiah, said: “Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God! Have You then deceived this people and Jerusalem, by saying: ‘Peace will be for you’? Yet now, behold, the sword of war has reached even to our very souls, bringing death and despair.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:11) 
In that appointed time, it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: “A scorching wind comes from the desert road, O daughter of My people. It is not a gentle wind to cool you or to cleanse you.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:12) 
A mighty, destructive wind will come to Me from those northern lands. Now indeed, I will speak My judgments and execute them against My people.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:13) 
Behold, the enemy will advance like storm clouds, and his chariots will rush forward like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are utterly devastated!

(Jeremiah 4:4:14) 
Wash your heart clean from wickedness, O Jerusalem, so that you may be saved! How long will these harmful and sinful thoughts dwell within you?

(Jeremiah 4:4:15) 
For a voice is now announcing the approaching danger from Dan, the northernmost tribe. And it is making known the idol-worship from Mount Ephraim, which is the cause of this coming judgment.

(Jeremiah 4:4:16) 
Announce to the nations! Behold, Jerusalem has heard the news through her watchmen: a siege is coming from a distant land! The enemy has raised its battle cry against the cities of Judah.

(Jeremiah 4:4:17) 
Like watchmen guarding fields, they—the invaders—have encircled Jerusalem, because she despised Me, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 4:4:18) 
Your own ways and your evil practices have brought these things upon you. This is your wickedness, because it is bitter in its fruits, and because it has penetrated deep into your very heart.

(Jeremiah 4:4:19) 
My inner being, my inner being is in pain, and my heart aches with anguish! My very core is disturbed within me; I cannot be silent. For my soul has heard the sound of the trumpet, the dreadful sound of the battle cry!

(Jeremiah 4:4:20) 
Destruction upon destruction is announced! All the land is being laid waste. Suddenly my dwelling places are destroyed; in an instant, my tents are in ruins.

(Jeremiah 4:4:21) 
How long must I witness the people fleeing, and hear the terrifying sound of the trumpet?

(Jeremiah 4:4:22) 
“Because My people are foolish, they have not truly known Me. They are senseless children, lacking understanding and wisdom. They are skilled and wise only in doing evil, but they have not learned how to do good.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:23) 
I looked at the earth, and behold, it was desolate and utterly void, like the primordial chaos. And I looked at the skies, and there was no light in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:24) 
I saw the mountains, and behold, they were trembling. All the hills were disturbed and shaking.

(Jeremiah 4:4:25) 
I looked, and behold, there was no human being. Every bird of the sky had fled away.

(Jeremiah 4:4:26) 
I saw, and behold, the fertile land of Carmel was a desert. Every city belonging to it was demolished before the face of the Lord, and before the terrible wrath of His fury.

(Jeremiah 4:4:27) 
For this is what the Lord says: “All the land will be a desolation. However, I will not make a complete end of it, so that some remnant will remain.”

(Jeremiah 4:4:28) 
Because of this, the earth will mourn, and the skies above will darken in sorrow. This is because I have spoken, I have intended it, and I have not repented of My decision, nor have I turned away from My decree.

(Jeremiah 4:4:29) 
From the sound of the cavalry and the archers, the people fled. They ran into the forests and climbed upon the rocks for refuge. All the cities were abandoned, and no human being remained living in them.

(Jeremiah 4:4:30) 
And you, O ravaged Jerusalem, what will you do now? Though you clothe yourself in scarlet, and adorn yourself with golden jewelry, and paint your eyes with dark kohl, you will adorn yourself in vain. Your former allies and lovers have despised you; they will seek to take your very life.

(Jeremiah 4:4:31) 
For I have heard a voice like that of a woman in labor, the deep distress like one giving birth for the first time. It is the voice of the daughter of Zion, gasping for breath and dying in agony, stretching out her hands in despair. Woe is me! For my soul fails within me because of all those who are slain!”

(Jeremiah 5:5:1) 
Go through the streets of Jerusalem and look, observe, and search in its public places. See if you can find even one person who practices justice and lives faithfully before God. If you can, I will spare the entire city.

(Jeremiah 5:5:2) 
And even when they swear, saying, 'As the Lord lives,' they are swearing falsely in their hearts.

(Jeremiah 5:5:3) 
O Lord, your eyes look for faithfulness in people. You struck them, but they felt no sorrow for their sins. You crushed them with your judgments, but they refused to accept discipline. They have made their faces harder than rock itself and refused to turn back to You.

(Jeremiah 5:5:4) 
But I, Jeremiah, thought: 'Perhaps these are only the poor and foolish people, those who do not know the Lord’s way or the justice required by their God.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:5) 
So I will go to the prominent leaders and speak with them, for they certainly know the Lord’s way and the justice demanded by their God. But look, they too have together broken the yoke of God’s law and have burst His bonds.

(Jeremiah 5:5:6) 
Therefore, a lion from the forest has struck them down. A wolf of the evening has laid waste to them. A leopard watches continually over their cities. Everyone who ventures out from within them will be seized and torn apart. This is because their transgressions have become exceedingly numerous, and their apostasies against God have grown strong.

(Jeremiah 5:5:7) 
Considering all these things, how can I possibly show you mercy, O Judah? Your children have abandoned Me and have sworn their oaths by those who are not gods at all. I filled them with abundance, yet they committed adultery, and they indulged themselves in the houses of prostitutes.

(Jeremiah 5:5:8) 
Every one of them has become like a lustful, neighing horse. Each man whinnies after his neighbor's wife with unbridled desire.

(Jeremiah 5:5:9) 
Shall I not bring judgment for these things, declares the Lord? Or shall My very soul not take vengeance on such a nation as this?

(Jeremiah 5:5:10) 
Go up onto her walls and tear them down, but do not utterly destroy everything. Cut off her branches, for they do not belong to the Lord.

(Jeremiah 5:5:11) 
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt with Me with extreme treachery, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 5:5:12) 
They have denied the very existence and power of the Lord, saying, 'He is nothing! Evil will not come upon us, nor will we ever see war or famine.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:13) 
The prophets also speak mere wind; there is no divine message from God in their words. Therefore, these judgments will indeed happen to them instead.

(Jeremiah 5:5:14) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of the armies of heaven, says: 'Because you, O false prophets and people, have spoken this word of denial and falsehood, behold, I am putting My true words, spoken through Jeremiah, into your mouth as a raging fire, and this people will be like wood, and My words will consume them entirely.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:15) 
Behold, O house of Israel, I am bringing upon you a nation from far away, declares the Lord. It is a strong nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you will not understand, nor will you be able to comprehend what they say.

(Jeremiah 5:5:16) 
Their quiver is like an open tomb, for all their warriors are mighty.

(Jeremiah 5:5:17) 
And they will consume your harvests and your bread. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will devour your vines and your fig trees. And with the sword, they will destroy your fortified cities, in which you place your trust.

(Jeremiah 5:5:18) 
Nevertheless, even in those dreadful days, declares the Lord, I will not make a complete end of you.

(Jeremiah 5:5:19) 
And when you ask, 'Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them: 'Just as you abandoned Me and served foreign gods in your own land, so too will you be forced to serve strangers in a land that is not your own.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:20) 
Declare this message to the house of Jacob, and make it heard in Judah, saying:

(Jeremiah 5:5:21) 
Hear this, O foolish and senseless people! You have eyes, but you refuse to see; you have ears, but you choose not to hear.

(Jeremiah 5:5:22) 
Do you not fear Me, declares the Lord? Will you not tremble before My presence? It is I who set the sand as the sea’s boundary, an eternal decree it cannot pass. Though its waves surge and roar, they cannot prevail, and though they swell, they cannot cross over it.

(Jeremiah 5:5:23) 
But this people has developed a stubborn and rebellious heart. They have turned away from Me and have departed from My ways.

(Jeremiah 5:5:24) 
They do not say in their hearts, 'Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives us the seasonal rains, both the autumn and spring showers at their proper time, and who preserves for us the full bounty of the annual harvest.'

(Jeremiah 5:5:25) 
Your iniquities have caused all this abundance to be withheld, and your sins have turned away every good thing from you.

(Jeremiah 5:5:26) 
For among My people, wicked men are found. They lie in wait, just like bird catchers setting snares and traps to capture other people.

(Jeremiah 5:5:27) 
Just as a cage is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. And by means of this deception, they have become great and have grown rich.

(Jeremiah 5:5:28) 
They have become well-fed and sleek. They have wickedly ignored My words. They have not judged the cause of the widow, nor have they taken up the case of the orphan, and they have failed to uphold the rights of the poor.

(Jeremiah 5:5:29) 
Shall I not bring judgment for these things, declares the Lord? Or shall My very soul not take vengeance on such a nation as this?

(Jeremiah 5:5:30) 
A dreadful and astonishing thing has taken place in this land.

(Jeremiah 5:5:31) 
The prophets spoke false prophecies, and the priests ruled in agreement with them. And My people loved to have it so! But what will you do then, when the end comes for all of this?

(Jeremiah 6:1) 
Prepare yourselves, O children of Benjamin, and flee from the midst of Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal over Beth-Haccerem! For a great evil is being seen coming from the north, and a mighty destruction is approaching.

(Jeremiah 6:2) 
I have compared the daughter of Zion—the city of Jerusalem—to a beautiful and delicate woman.

(Jeremiah 6:3) 
Against her will come shepherds and their flocks—these are the invading armies. They will pitch their tents all around her, and each one will graze their flocks in her fields, taking possession of her land.

(Jeremiah 6:4) 
The invaders cry out, 'Prepare for war against her! Rise up, let us attack her at noon!' Then they lament, 'Woe to us, for the day is declining! The evening shadows are growing long!'

(Jeremiah 6:5) 
So they determine, 'Rise up, let us attack by night, and let us destroy her palaces!'

(Jeremiah 6:6) 
For this is what the Lord of hosts says: 'Cut down her trees, and cast up a siege mound all around Jerusalem. This is the city marked for punishment, for all manner of oppression is found within her.'

(Jeremiah 6:7) 
Just as a cistern keeps its water fresh, so she—Jerusalem—has kept her wickedness fresh and flowing. Nothing but violence and ruin will be heard within her walls.

(Jeremiah 6:8) 
Receive instruction, O Jerusalem! Be warned, lest My soul finally depart from you, lest I make you a desolate land, utterly uninhabitable.

(Jeremiah 6:9) 
This is what the Lord of hosts says: 'They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel, like grapes in a vineyard, down to the last cluster. Return, you invaders, like a grape-gatherer to his basket, and glean again!'

(Jeremiah 6:10) 
To whom shall I speak? Whom shall I warn so that they might listen? Behold, their ears are spiritually uncircumcised and closed; they cannot hear. Behold, the Word of the Lord has become an object of scorn to them, and they do not accept it.

(Jeremiah 6:11) 
Therefore, I am full of the Lord's wrath; I am weary of holding it in. I must pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together. Indeed, I will pour it out upon man and woman alike, upon the old man and the one full of days—even the very aged.

(Jeremiah 6:12) 
Their houses will pass to others, their fields and their wives will be taken together. For I will stretch out My punishing hand upon the inhabitants of this land, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 6:13) 
For from the least of them to the greatest, everyone is given over to greed and covetousness. From the prophets to the priests, all practice deceit.

(Jeremiah 6:14) 
They tried to heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people—Israel—with superficial and shameful words, saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there was no peace at all.

(Jeremiah 6:15) 
They will certainly be put to shame because they committed such abominations. But instead of being ashamed, they were not at all confused by their own wickedness and did not know how to blush. Therefore, they shall fall among those who are falling; in the time of their visitation—their punishment—they shall stumble, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 6:16) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Stand by the ways and look, and ask for the ancient paths. Ask which is the good way, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.' But they—the people—replied, 'We will not walk in it.'

(Jeremiah 6:17) 
And I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they replied, 'We will not listen!'

(Jeremiah 6:18) 
Therefore, hear, O you nations, and know, O assembly of peoples, how great the judgments are that I will bring upon them!

(Jeremiah 6:19) 
Hear, O earth! Behold, I am bringing calamity upon this people—it is the fruit of their own evil thoughts and plans. For they have not listened to My words, and they have rejected My law.

(Jeremiah 6:20) 
To what purpose do you bring Me frankincense from Sheba, and sweet-smelling cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not accepted by Me, and your sacrifices have not pleased Me.

(Jeremiah 6:21) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will set stumbling blocks before this people; upon them, fathers and sons shall stumble together. Neighbor and friend shall perish together.'

(Jeremiah 6:22) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, a people is coming from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the farthest reaches of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 6:23) 
They will grasp bow and shield; they are cruel and will show no mercy. Their voice will roar like the surging sea, and they will ride upon horses, arrayed as a warrior prepared for battle against you, O daughter of Zion—Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 6:24) 
We have heard the report of them, and our hands are paralyzed with fear. Anguish has seized us, and pains like those of a woman in childbirth.

(Jeremiah 6:25) 
Do not go out into the fields, and do not walk on the roads, for the sword of the enemy brings terror and destruction all around.

(Jeremiah 6:26) 
O daughter of My people, gird yourself with sackcloth and sprinkle yourself with ashes! Mourn as for an only son, and make a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.

(Jeremiah 6:27) 
I have made you, Jeremiah, an assayer among My people, a strong one. You are to know and test their way—their conduct.

(Jeremiah 6:28) 
All of them are rebellious princes, walking deceitfully. They are like bronze and iron—hardened and thoroughly corrupt.

(Jeremiah 6:29) 
The bellows have blown out, and the lead is consumed by the fire. The refiner has melted the ore in vain, for their wickedness is not consumed or purged away.

(Jeremiah 6:30) 
Call them rejected silver, for the Lord has cast them away as worthless.

(Jeremiah 7:7,1) 
The Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 7:7,2) 
“Stand at the gate of the Lord’s Temple and proclaim this message there. Say, ‘Listen to the word of the Lord, all of you people of Judah, who come through these gates to worship the Lord!’”

(Jeremiah 7:7,3) 
“This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Amend your ways of living and your daily actions. If you do, I will continue to let you dwell in this place.

(Jeremiah 7:7,4) 
Do not trust in the lies being told when people say, “This is the Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord!” —as if the building itself will save you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,5) 
For only if you truly amend your ways of living and your daily actions, and if you truly act justly with one another,

(Jeremiah 7:7,6) 
and if you do not oppress the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and if you do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow after other gods—which would only bring evil upon yourselves—

(Jeremiah 7:7,7) 
only then will I allow you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.

(Jeremiah 7:7,8) 
But now, look, you are trusting in deceitful words that cannot help you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,9) 
You steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely by God’s name, offer sacrifices to the pagan god Baalim, and then go after other foreign gods whom you have no true knowledge of.

(Jeremiah 7:7,10) 
And after all this, you come and stand before Me in this Temple, where My name is invoked, and you say, “We are safe now!” simply because you have committed all these abominations.

(Jeremiah 7:7,11) 
Has this Temple, where My name is invoked by you, become nothing more than a hideout for robbers in your eyes? Yes, I Myself have seen this, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 7:7,12) 
Go now to My former dwelling place in Shiloh, where My name first dwelled among you, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people, Israel.

(Jeremiah 7:7,13) 
And now, because you have done all these wicked deeds, declares the Lord—even though I spoke to you persistently, rising early to speak, but you did not listen; and I called to you, but you did not answer—

(Jeremiah 7:7,14) 
I will do to this Temple, where My name is invoked and in which you place your trust, and to this land that I gave to you and your ancestors, exactly what I did to Shiloh.

(Jeremiah 7:7,15) 
I will cast you out of My sight, just as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the descendants of Ephraim—the northern kingdom of Israel.

(Jeremiah 7:7,16) 
Therefore, you, Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not offer up any praise or prayer on their behalf. Do not plead with Me, because I will not listen to you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,17) 
Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

(Jeremiah 7:7,18) 
The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make ritual cakes for the “Queen of Heaven” —a pagan goddess. They pour out drink offerings to other foreign gods, all of which provokes My wrath.

(Jeremiah 7:7,19) 
Is it really Me they are provoking? declares the Lord. No, they are only provoking themselves, bringing shame and disgrace upon their own faces.

(Jeremiah 7:7,20) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, My fury and My indignation will be poured out upon this place—upon the people, upon the animals, upon the trees of the region, and upon the produce of the earth. It will ignite, and it will not be quenched.”

(Jeremiah 7:7,21) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Go ahead and add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat all the meat yourselves—I have no desire for them.

(Jeremiah 7:7,22) 
For when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them primarily about burnt offerings and other sacrifices.

(Jeremiah 7:7,23) 
Instead, this is the command I gave them: ‘Listen to My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people. Walk in all the ways that I command you, so that it may go well with you.’

(Jeremiah 7:7,24) 
But they did not listen, nor did they pay any attention. Instead, they walked according to their own desires and the stubborn wickedness of their evil hearts. They turned their backs on Me and did not move forward.

(Jeremiah 7:7,25) 
From the day your ancestors departed from the land of Egypt until this very day, I have sent all My servants the prophets to you, tirelessly sending them day after day, rising early to send them.

(Jeremiah 7:7,26) 
Yet they did not listen to Me, nor did they pay any attention. Instead, they stubbornly stiffened their necks and behaved even worse than their ancestors.

(Jeremiah 7:7,27) 
You will speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You will call to them, but they will not answer you.

(Jeremiah 7:7,28) 
Then you are to say to them: ‘This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of the Lord their God, nor has it accepted correction. Faithfulness has perished, and it is no longer found in their mouths.

(Jeremiah 7:7,29) 
Cut off your hair and throw it away, and then raise a lamentation on the bare heights—a public mourning ritual. For the Lord has rejected and abandoned the generation that has aroused His wrath.

(Jeremiah 7:7,30) 
“For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the Lord. They have placed their detestable idols in the Temple where My name is invoked, thereby defiling it.

(Jeremiah 7:7,31) 
They have also built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—a horrifying act which I never commanded, nor did it ever enter My mind.

(Jeremiah 7:7,32) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when this place will no longer be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but instead, ‘The Valley of Slaughter.’ People will be forced to bury the dead in Topheth because there will be no other space left.

(Jeremiah 7:7,33) 
The dead bodies of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.

(Jeremiah 7:7,34) 
I will silence the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bridegroom and the bride, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, for the entire land will be utterly devastated and uninhabited.”

(Jeremiah 8:1) 
“At that time,” the Lord declares, “they will dig up the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.

(Jeremiah 8:2) 
They will then spread those bones out before the sun, the moon, and all the celestial bodies—which they loved, which they served, which they followed, which they sought out, and which they worshipped. The bones will not be gathered or buried; instead, they will lie like refuse on the surface of the earth,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:3) 
And all the survivors from this evil lineage, those who remain in all the places where I have driven them, will prefer death over life,” declares the Lord of Armies.

(Jeremiah 8:4) 
Then you are to say to them: “This is what the Lord says: 'When someone falls, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not come back?'

(Jeremiah 8:5) 
Why then has this people of Jerusalem turned away with such stubborn defiance? They cling to lies and refuse to return to Me.

(Jeremiah 8:6) 
I have listened and heard: no one speaks what is good, no one repents of their wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone rushes headlong into their chosen path, like a horse charging wildly into battle.

(Jeremiah 8:7) 
Even the kite in the sky knows its appointed seasons; the turtle-dove, the swallow, and the stork observe the time of their migration. But My people do not know the judgment of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:8) 
How can you say, 'We are wise, and the Law of the Lord is with us'? Indeed, the lying pen of the scribes has turned it into a falsehood. Their interpretation is a lie.

(Jeremiah 8:9) 
The wise are put to shame; they are terrified and trapped. For they have rejected the word of the Lord, so what wisdom is left in them?

(Jeremiah 8:10) 
Therefore, I will give their wives to strangers and their fields to new inheritors. For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for dishonest gain; from prophet to priest, everyone practices deceit.

(Jeremiah 8:11) 
They treat the brokenness of My people superficially, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no true peace.

(Jeremiah 8:12) 
They ought to be ashamed because they have committed such abominations. Yet, they are not at all ashamed; they do not even know how to blush. Therefore, they will fall among those who are falling; at the time of their punishment, they will collapse,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:13) 
“I will surely gather them for destruction,” declares the Lord. “There are no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf has withered. What I had given them has passed away from them.”

(Jeremiah 8:14) 
“Why do we sit here idly? Gather together, and let us enter the fortified cities and be silent there, for the Lord our God has made us silent and given us bitter, poisonous water to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:15) 
We waited for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, there was only turmoil.

(Jeremiah 8:16) 
The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their mighty steeds, the whole land trembles. They have come and devoured the land and everything in it—the city and its inhabitants.

(Jeremiah 8:17) 
For behold, I am sending among you venomous serpents—vipers whose bites cannot be charmed away. And they will bite you,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 8:18) 
My sorrow is beyond sorrow; my heart is mournful within me.

(Jeremiah 8:19) 
Listen! The cry of my people is heard from a distant land: 'Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King not there?' 'Why then have they provoked Me to anger with their carved idols and with their worthless foreign gods?'

(Jeremiah 8:20) 
The harvest is over, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.

(Jeremiah 8:21) 
For the brokenness of my people, I am crushed; I am grieved, and despair has overwhelmed me.

(Jeremiah 8:22) 
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the wound of my people not been healed?

(Jeremiah 9:1) 
If only my head were a fountain of water, and my eyes an endless spring of tears! Then I could cry day and night for all the people of my nation who have been violently killed.

(Jeremiah 9:2) 
Oh, if only I had a traveler's lodging place far away in the desert! Then I would abandon my own people and run away from them. For they are all spiritually unfaithful to God, acting like adulterers, and their whole assembly is full of those who rebel against God's laws.

(Jeremiah 9:3) 
They make their tongues like a taut bow, ready to shoot out lies instead of truth. They have grown strong in their evil ways in the land, constantly progressing from one sin to another. 'They have not truly known Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:4) 
Let everyone be on guard against their neighbor, and do not trust any brother. For every brother will try to trip you up with deceit, and every friend will walk about spreading slanders and lies.

(Jeremiah 9:5) 
People will mock their own brother, and they will refuse to speak the truth. For they have specifically trained their tongues to speak only lies. They have behaved wickedly, and they refuse to turn away from their sins and repent.

(Jeremiah 9:6) 
Your dwelling place is entirely surrounded by treachery. They continue to act in deceit, and because of this, they have not truly known Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:7) 
Therefore, the Lord of heavenly armies says this: 'Behold, I will refine them through suffering, and I will test their hearts like metal. For what else can I possibly do with the behavior of My people?'

(Jeremiah 9:8) 
Their tongue is a deadly, wounding arrow, always speaking deceit. With their mouth, they speak words of peace to their neighbor, but secretly, they set traps and snares for them.

(Jeremiah 9:9) 
Because of all these sins, 'Shall I not visit them with My judgment?' says the Lord. 'And for a nation behaving in this manner, shall My very soul not take vengeance?'

(Jeremiah 9:10) 
I will take up a lament and mourning over the mountains, and a dirge over the beautiful pastures of the wilderness. For they have been so utterly burned and laid waste that no one can even pass through them. No sound of human or animal is heard, for even the birds of the sky and the cattle have fled away and are gone.

(Jeremiah 9:11) 
I will turn Jerusalem into heaps of rubble, a den for wild jackals. And I will make the cities of Judah utterly desolate, with no one left to live in them.

(Jeremiah 9:12) 
Who is truly wise enough to understand this? To whom has the Lord spoken clearly enough to explain it? Why has the land perished? Why has it become desolate like a wilderness, with no one left to even pass through it?

(Jeremiah 9:13) 
And the Lord Himself answered, saying: 'This has happened because they abandoned My law, which I gave to them. They did not listen to My voice, and they refused to live according to My commands.'

(Jeremiah 9:14) 
Instead, they followed the stubborn wickedness of their own hearts and pursued the Baals—the false gods that their fathers had taught them to worship.

(Jeremiah 9:15) 
Therefore, the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says this: 'Behold, I will feed this people with a bitter herb, like wormwood, and I will give them poisonous water to drink, like gall.'

(Jeremiah 9:16) 
I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have ever known. And I will send the sword of war after them, until they are completely consumed and destroyed.

(Jeremiah 9:17) 
The Lord of heavenly armies says this: 'Pay close attention! Call for the professional mourning women to come; send for those who are skilled in lamentation, and tell them to hurry!'

(Jeremiah 9:18) 
Let them hurry and begin a lament over us, so that our eyes may stream with tears, and our eyelids pour out floods of water.

(Jeremiah 9:19) 
For a voice of lamentation is heard coming from Zion: 'How utterly destroyed we are! How profoundly we are shamed! For we have been forced to abandon our land, and our homes have been torn down and ruined!'

(Jeremiah 9:20) 
Therefore, women, listen to the word of the Lord! Let your ears receive the solemn words that come from His mouth. Teach your daughters how to lament, and let each woman teach her neighbor a mournful dirge.

(Jeremiah 9:21) 
For death has climbed through our windows; it has entered our very homes. It has come to kill the little children playing outside and the young men gathered in the public squares.

(Jeremiah 9:22) 
Speak this message: 'Thus says the Lord: The corpses of men will fall like dung upon the surface of the land, and they will be like grain bundles left behind the reaper, with no one left to gather them for burial.'

(Jeremiah 9:23) 
The Lord says this: 'Let no wise person boast in their own wisdom, and let no strong person boast in their own strength, and let no rich person boast in their own riches.'

(Jeremiah 9:24) 
But if anyone desires to boast, let them boast in this: that they truly know and understand Me—that I am the Lord who demonstrates steadfast mercy, unwavering justice, and righteousness throughout the earth. For these are the things that please Me,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 9:25) 
'Behold, the days are coming,' says the Lord, 'when I will bring judgment upon everyone who is circumcised physically but still holds an uncircumcised heart—meaning, they are outwardly religious but inwardly rebellious.'

(Jeremiah 9:26) 
This judgment will come upon Egypt, and upon Judah, and upon Edom, and upon the Ammonites, and upon Moab, and upon all those desert dwellers who shave the hair at the corners of their temples as a pagan practice. For while all these other nations are physically uncircumcised, the entire house of Israel is, in a more profound way, uncircumcised in their heart, showing no true devotion to God.

(Jeremiah 10:1) 
Pay attention to the message of the Lord that He has spoken to you, O house of Israel.

(Jeremiah 10:2) 
The Lord says this: Do not learn to live according to the ways of the gentile nations, and do not be afraid of the signs in the sky, which those pagan nations fear.

(Jeremiah 10:3) 
Because the customs of other peoples are empty and meaningless. It is a tree cut from the forest, an object crafted by the hands of a carpenter with an axe.

(Jeremiah 10:4) 
They make it beautiful with silver and gold. Then they fasten it with nails and hammers so that it will not fall over or move.

(Jeremiah 10:5) 
They are like a scarecrow standing in a cucumber field; they cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk on their own. Therefore, do not fear them, because they cannot do any evil, nor can they do any good.

(Jeremiah 10:6) 
There is no one like you, O Lord. You are truly great, and your name is mighty in strength.

(Jeremiah 10:7) 
Who would not fear you, King of all nations? Indeed, honor is properly due to you. Among all the wise people of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one who is like you.

(Jeremiah 10:8) 
All of them will equally prove to be foolish and stupid. The teaching of their worthless idols is nothing more than wood.

(Jeremiah 10:9) 
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Ophir. It is the work of a craftsman and the hands of a goldsmith. Blue and purple cloth form their clothing. All these idols are simply the work of human artisans.

(Jeremiah 10:10) 
But the Lord is the true God. He is the living God, and the eternal King. The earth trembles at His indignation, and the nations cannot endure His threats.

(Jeremiah 10:11) 
Therefore, you shall say to them: "The gods that did not make the universe and the earth will utterly perish from the earth, and from all that is under the universe."

(Jeremiah 10:12) 
He Himself made the earth by His own power. He established the world by His own wisdom, and by His own understanding, He stretched out the celestial bodies of the universe.

(Jeremiah 10:13) 
At the sound of His voice, He brings abundant waters into the sky, and He raises clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash during the turns of the rain, and He brings forth the wind from His storehouses.

(Jeremiah 10:14) 
Every human being has become foolish by their own supposed knowledge. Every artisan is put to shame by his carved idol, because his molten image is a lie, and there is no spirit of life within them.

(Jeremiah 10:15) 
They are worthless, and their work is worthy of ridicule. In the time of their judgment, they will utterly perish.

(Jeremiah 10:16) 
The portion of Jacob is not like these idols. For He who formed all things is the true God, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance. The Lord of Hosts is His name.

(Jeremiah 10:17) 
Gather up your goods from the land, you who live under siege.

(Jeremiah 10:18) 
For this is what the Lord says: "Behold, this time I will hurl out the inhabitants of the land far away, and I will distress them so severely that their wickedness will be revealed."

(Jeremiah 10:19) 
Woe is me because of my brokenness. My wound is becoming severe. And I said, "Truly, I am crushed by this sickness."

(Jeremiah 10:20) 
My tent has been destroyed. All my ropes are broken. My children have gone out from me, and they are no more. There is no one left to spread out my tent or set up my tent coverings.

(Jeremiah 10:21) 
Because the shepherds have acted foolishly. They have not sought the Lord. Therefore, they have not acted wisely, and all their flock is scattered.

(Jeremiah 10:22) 
Listen! A sound of a rumor is coming. A great commotion approaches from the land of the north. Its purpose is to make the cities of Judah a desolate wilderness and a lair for jackals.

(Jeremiah 10:23) 
I know, O Lord, that a human being's way is not his own path to choose. Nor is it for a man to walk and direct his own steps.

(Jeremiah 10:24) 
Correct me, O Lord, but do so with just judgment. Do not correct me in your furious anger, lest you reduce me to nothing.

(Jeremiah 10:25) 
Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, and upon the regions that have not called upon your name. For they have consumed Jacob, and they have devoured and utterly destroyed him. They have laid waste to his homeland and its beauty.

(Jeremiah 11:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 11:2) 
"Listen to the terms of this covenant," the Lord commanded, "and speak them to the men of Judah and to all who live in Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 11:3) 
Then you must tell them: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Cursed is anyone who does not listen to the terms of this covenant, and does not obey them.'"

(Jeremiah 11:4) 
"These are the terms I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of that blazing iron furnace of slavery. I told them: 'Listen to My voice, and do everything I command you. If you do, you will be My people, and I will be your God.'"

(Jeremiah 11:5) 
"I made this covenant so that I would keep the oath I swore to your fathers—that I would give them a land flowing with milk and honey, just as it is this very day." Then I, Jeremiah, answered, saying, "Amen, O Lord!"

(Jeremiah 11:6) 
And the Lord said to me: "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the open places of Jerusalem, saying: 'Listen to the words of this covenant, and obey them.'"

(Jeremiah 11:7) 
"For I solemnly warned your fathers from the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt until this very day. I rose early and repeatedly warned them, saying: 'Listen to My voice!'"

(Jeremiah 11:8) 
"But they would not listen, nor would they pay attention. Instead, each one stubbornly followed the evil desires of their own heart. So, I brought upon them all the curses of this covenant—the very words I commanded them to obey, but which they refused to do."

(Jeremiah 11:9) 
And the Lord said to me: "A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 11:10) 
"They have turned back to the wickedness of their ancestors, who refused to listen to My words. And these people have gone after foreign gods to serve them. The people of Israel and the people of Judah have broken My covenant, the one I made with their fathers."

(Jeremiah 11:11) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: "Behold, I am bringing upon them such evils and calamities that they will not be able to escape. When they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them."

(Jeremiah 11:12) 
"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the false gods to whom they offer their libations, but those gods will not be able to save them in their time of affliction."

(Jeremiah 11:13) 
"For you, O Judah, have as many gods as you have cities! And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem, you have set up altars of shame, altars to offer sacrifices to the Baals."

(Jeremiah 11:14) 
"Therefore, Jeremiah, do not pray for this people, nor offer up any praise or prayer on their behalf. For I will not listen when they cry out to Me in their time of affliction."

(Jeremiah 11:15) 
"Why has My beloved nation committed so many wicked deeds right in My own house, the Temple? Will the holy sacrifices you offer cleanse you of your evil deeds? Can these rituals truly turn you away from your sins?"

(Jeremiah 11:16) 
"The Lord once called you a leafy olive tree, beautiful, fruitful, and pleasing. But now, at the sound of a great, roaring storm, He has set its wood on fire, and its branches are burned."

(Jeremiah 11:17) 
"And the Lord of hosts, who first planted you like an olive tree, has declared that disaster will come upon you because of the evils that the people of Israel and the people of Judah brought upon themselves. They provoked Me to wrath by offering sacrifices to the Baals."

(Jeremiah 11:18) 
But You, O Lord, have shown me what is happening, and I have come to know it. You then revealed to me their wicked schemes.

(Jeremiah 11:19) 
I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter, completely unaware that they had devised plots against me. They were saying: "Let us put wood into his bread"—meaning, "Let us destroy him by cutting off his sustenance and strength"—"and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will no longer be remembered."

(Jeremiah 11:20) 
But You, O Lord of hosts, who judge justly and examine the innermost thoughts and hearts of all, let me see Your vengeance upon them. For I have laid my entire case before You.

(Jeremiah 11:21) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your very life and say, "You must not prophesy in the name of the Lord, or you will die by our hands."

(Jeremiah 11:22) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts says: "Behold, I will punish them! Their young men will die by the sword, and their sons and their daughters will die by famine."

(Jeremiah 11:23) 
"And there will be no remnant of them left alive. For I will bring calamity upon the men of Anathoth in the very year of their reckoning and punishment."

(Jeremiah 12:12:1) 
You are righteous, Lord, if I were to contend with You. Yet, I will speak with You concerning justice. Why does the path of the wicked prosper? Why is it well for all who deal treacherously and act wickedly?

(Jeremiah 12:12:2) 
You planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are near to their mouths, but You are far from their inner hearts and consciences.

(Jeremiah 12:12:3) 
But You, Lord, know me; You have seen me and tested my heart concerning You. Gather them together like sheep ready for sacrifice, and set them apart for the day of their slaughter and destruction.

(Jeremiah 12:12:4) 
How long will the earth mourn, and the grass of every field wither, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants? The beasts and the birds have perished, because the wicked have said, 'God will not see what becomes of us in the end.'

(Jeremiah 12:12:5) 
If you have struggled running with footmen, how then will you be able to contend with horses? And if you have felt secure in a land of peace, what will you do when the Jordan overflows its banks?

(Jeremiah 12:12:6) 
For even your brothers and your father’s household, even they have fought against you, and they have cried out loudly after you. Do not believe them, even when they speak pleasant words to you.

(Jeremiah 12:12:7) 
I have forsaken My house, My temple, and My people. I have abandoned My heritage, Israel. I have given My dearly beloved people into the hand of their enemies.

(Jeremiah 12:12:8) 
My heritage has become to Me like a roaring lion in the forest. She has raised her voice against Me, so I have treated her as an enemy.

(Jeremiah 12:12:9) 
Is My heritage to Me like a bird of various colors? Or have dyed birds—foreign invaders—surrounded Me? Come, gather together, all you beasts of the field, hurry to devour her!

(Jeremiah 12:12:10) 
Many shepherds—foreign invaders and their rulers—have destroyed My vineyard. They have trampled My treasured portion of land. They have turned My desirable portion into a desolate wilderness.

(Jeremiah 12:12:11) 
They have laid it utterly waste. The entire land mourns before Me, because there is no one who takes these things to heart or repents.

(Jeremiah 12:12:12) 
Over all the barren pathways, the destroyers have come. For the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other. There is no peace for anyone.

(Jeremiah 12:12:13) 
They have sown wheat, but they have reaped thorns. They will inherit only toil, and it will not profit them. You will be put to shame by your harvest, because of the burning anger of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 12:12:14) 
Thus says the Lord concerning all My evil neighbors who have touched My inheritance—the land which I distributed to My people Israel: Behold, I will uproot them from their own land. And I will pull out the roots of Judah from the midst of those nations.

(Jeremiah 12:12:15) 
And it shall be, after I have uprooted them, I will turn and have compassion on them. I will bring them back, each person to his own inheritance, and each one to his own land.

(Jeremiah 12:12:16) 
And it shall be, if they diligently learn the ways of My people, so that they swear by My Name, saying, 'As the Lord lives'—just as they taught My people to swear by Baal—then they will be built up in the midst of My people.

(Jeremiah 12:12:17) 
But if they do not listen and obey, then I will utterly uproot and destroy that nation, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 13:1) 
The Lord told me this: "Go get yourself a linen loincloth, and put it on your body around your waist. Don't ever wash it in water."

(Jeremiah 13:2) 
So I got the loincloth, just as the Lord had commanded. And I put it on.

(Jeremiah 13:3) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, a second time, saying this:

(Jeremiah 13:4) 
"Take the loincloth you just got, the one you are wearing. Go to the Euphrates River, and hide it there in a crack in the rock."

(Jeremiah 13:5) 
So I went and hid it, just as the Lord had commanded me.

(Jeremiah 13:6) 
After many days passed, the Lord told me: "Go now. Go back to the Euphrates River and get the loincloth, the one I told you to hide there."

(Jeremiah 13:7) 
So I went to the Euphrates. I dug it up and took the loincloth from where I had hidden it. But behold, the loincloth was completely rotted and ruined. It was useless.

(Jeremiah 13:8) 
Then the Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Jeremiah 13:9) 
"The Lord says this: Just like this loincloth, I will cause the pride of Judah to rot away. And I will cause the great pride of Jerusalem to rot away."

(Jeremiah 13:10) 
"This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, and who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts, who have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them—they will become like this loincloth: good for nothing."

(Jeremiah 13:11) 
"Just as a loincloth clings closely to a man's body, so I had bound to Myself all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah," says the Lord. "My intention was for them to be My people, a source of fame, praise, and glory to Me. But they did not listen."

(Jeremiah 13:12) 
"So you shall speak this proverb to them: 'The Lord God of Israel says this: "Every wine jar will be filled with wine." And they will say to you, 'Of course, we know that every wine jar will be filled with wine! What's the point?'"

(Jeremiah 13:13) 
"Then you shall say to them: 'The Lord says this: "Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land with a staggering drunkenness. This includes the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."'"

(Jeremiah 13:14) 
"I will scatter them, separating each person from their brother, fathers and sons alike," says the Lord. "I will show no mercy, no pity, and no forgiveness; I will simply destroy them completely."

(Jeremiah 13:15) 
Listen and pay close attention with your ears. Do not be so proud, because the Lord has spoken this warning.

(Jeremiah 13:16) 
Give honor to the Lord your God now, before He causes your feet to stumble on the dark mountains. Before the shadowy mountains darken fully, you will look for light, but behold, it will be the shadow of death instead. And everything will turn into deep gloom.

(Jeremiah 13:17) 
But if you refuse to listen to this warning, my soul will weep in secret over your pride. It will weep bitterly, and my eyes will shed many tears, because the Lord's flock has been led away into captivity.

(Jeremiah 13:18) 
Tell the king and the queen mother: "Humble yourselves and sit in the dust!" "Because your glorious crown has fallen from your heads."

(Jeremiah 13:19) 
The cities of the Negeb, the southern region of Judah, are shut up. No one can get in or out. All of Judah has been exiled, carried away completely.

(Jeremiah 13:20) 
Lift up your eyes and look at those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you? Where are your glorious sheep?

(Jeremiah 13:21) 
What will you say when God punishes you? For you yourself have taught them to be against you, and you have appointed them as rulers over you, like princes over your head. Won't pains seize you, like a woman giving birth?

(Jeremiah 13:22) 
If you say in your heart, 'Why have these terrible things happened to me?' It is because of your many sins that your shameful parts have been exposed. Your garment has been stripped off, and your body left bare.

(Jeremiah 13:23) 
Can an Ethiopian change the color of his skin? Or can a leopard change its spots? Then you, who have become so accustomed to doing evil, can also do good.

(Jeremiah 13:24) 
Therefore, I will scatter them like straw, which is blown away by the wind across the desert.

(Jeremiah 13:25) 
"This is your fate, the portion I have allotted to you," says the Lord. "Because you have forgotten Me and have trusted in lies."

(Jeremiah 13:26) 
That is why I Myself have pulled up your skirt to expose your face. And all your public shame has been revealed.

(Jeremiah 13:27) 
"Your spiritual adulteries, the lustful neighing of your horses, the wickedness of your fornication—I have seen your abominations on the hills. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You will not be cleansed. How much longer will you persist in this?"

(Jeremiah 14:1) 
This is the message of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the severe drought conditions.

(Jeremiah 14:2) 
Judah mourned and her city gates collapsed in despair. The people sat on the ground, grieving, and the desperate cries of Jerusalem rose up.

(Jeremiah 14:3) 
The leaders sent their servants to fetch water. They went to draw it, but they found no water. They returned with their empty vessels, feeling ashamed and distressed, covering their heads in despair.

(Jeremiah 14:4) 
Because the land was so desolate, and because no rain fell upon the ground, the farmers were utterly ashamed. They too covered their heads in deep despair.

(Jeremiah 14:5) 
Even the wild deer in the field gave birth and then abandoned its young, because there was no grass for it to feed on.

(Jeremiah 14:6) 
And the wild donkeys stood on the bare rocks, gasping for air like desert beasts. Their eyes grew dim and faint, because there was no grass to be found anywhere.

(Jeremiah 14:7) 
Lord, if our many sins are testifying against us, then for the sake of your holy name, please act! For we have turned away from you so many times, and we have truly sinned against you.

(Jeremiah 14:8) 
You are the true hope of Israel, its only Savior in times of deep distress. Why do you act as if you are a mere stranger in our land, or like a traveler who just stops for the night to rest, with no intention of staying?

(Jeremiah 14:9) 
Why do you seem like a bewildered man, or like a mighty warrior who is powerless to save us? But Lord, you are truly among us, and your holy name has been called upon us. Do not abandon us!

(Jeremiah 14:10) 
This is what the Lord says to this people, who loved to wander away and never settled in His ways. The Lord was not pleased with them. Now, He will remember their many sins, and He will punish their evil deeds.

(Jeremiah 14:11) 
Then the Lord said to me: "Do not pray for this people's well-being."

(Jeremiah 14:12) 
"Even when they fast, I will not listen to their prayers. And if they offer burnt offerings and sacrifices, I will not accept them. For I will utterly consume them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence."

(Jeremiah 14:13) 
And I said, "Oh, oh, oh, Lord God! The prophets themselves are telling them, 'You will not see a sword, nor will there be famine among you. Instead, He will give you true peace in this very place!'"

(Jeremiah 14:14) 
Then the Lord said to me: "The prophets are speaking lies in My name! I did not send them, nor did I command them, nor did I speak to them. They are prophesying to you a deceitful vision, empty divination, every vile thing, and the deceptions that come from their own hearts."

(Jeremiah 14:15) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning those prophets who are prophesying in My name, whom I did not send, and who insist: 'There will be no sword or famine in this land!' Those very prophets will be consumed by the sword and by famine.

(Jeremiah 14:16) 
And the people to whom these prophets lie will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and the sword. There will be no one left to bury them—neither the people themselves, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. Indeed, I will pour out the full consequence of their own evil upon them.

(Jeremiah 14:17) 
And you, Jeremiah, shall say this word to them: "Let my eyes stream with tears day and night without ceasing, because the virgin daughter of my people has been utterly crushed with a great breaking, a very dreadful and grievous wound."

(Jeremiah 14:18) 
"If I go out to the fields, behold, there are those slain by the sword. And if I enter the city, behold, there are those wasted away by famine. Even the prophet and the priest have been led into exile, to a land they do not know."

(Jeremiah 14:19) 
"Have you completely rejected Judah? Has your soul truly abhorred Zion? Why then have you struck us so severely that we cannot be healed? We looked for peace, but no good came; we hoped for a time of healing, but behold, there is only terror!"

(Jeremiah 14:20) 
"We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have truly sinned against you."

(Jeremiah 14:21) 
"Do not give us over to public disgrace for the sake of your holy name. Do not dishonor the glorious throne of your majesty. Remember your covenant with us; do not annul it!"

(Jeremiah 14:22) 
"Can any of the idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies themselves give showers? Are you not the Lord our God, the only one we have waited for? For you alone are the one who has made all these things."

(Jeremiah 15:1) 
And the Lord said to me: "Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me interceding, My favor would not be with this people. Send them away from My presence, and let them depart for their judgment."

(Jeremiah 15:2) 
And when they ask you, 'Where shall we go out to?' you shall tell them: 'Thus says the Lord: Those appointed to death, to death they shall go. And those appointed to the sword, to the sword they shall go. And those appointed to famine, to famine they shall go. And those appointed to captivity, to captivity they shall go.'

(Jeremiah 15:3) 
And I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, says the Lord: the sword to kill, dogs to tear, the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy their corpses.

(Jeremiah 15:4) 
And I will make them an object of horror and shaking to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for all the detestable things he did in Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 15:5) 
For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Or who will mourn for you? Or who will go to pray for your peace and well-being?

(Jeremiah 15:6) 
You have forsaken Me, says the Lord; you have turned your back. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you. I am weary of relenting from judgment.

(Jeremiah 15:7) 
And I will scatter them with a winnowing fork to the very ends of the earth. I will make My people childless and destroy them, for they have not turned back from their wicked ways.

(Jeremiah 15:8) 
Their widows have become more numerous to Me than the sand of the sea. I have brought upon them, even upon the mother of young men, a destroyer at noonday, striking unexpectedly. Suddenly I have brought anguish and terrors upon her, even upon her cities.

(Jeremiah 15:9) 
She who bore seven children has grown weak; she has gasped her last breath. Her sun has set while it was still day, signifying a sudden and premature end to her prosperity. She has been shamed and disgraced. And their remaining ones I will deliver to the sword in the sight of their enemies, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 15:10) 
Woe is me, my mother! Why did you give birth to me, a man of strife, a man of contention to the whole land? I have neither lent money at interest nor borrowed it, so I have no financial disputes. Yet everyone curses me.

(Jeremiah 15:11) 
The Lord said: "Surely I will release you for your own good. Surely I will intercede for you in the time of affliction and in the time of tribulation against your enemy."

(Jeremiah 15:12) 
Can common iron be broken by iron from the north, or common metal by steel? (Meaning, Judah cannot withstand the northern invader).

(Jeremiah 15:13) 
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without payment, because of all your sins and throughout all your borders.

(Jeremiah 15:14) 
And I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths, even to the underworld.

(Jeremiah 15:15) 
You know, O Lord, remember me, and come to my aid, and deliver me from my persecutors. Do not, in Your enduring patience, allow me to be consumed. Know that for Your sake I have suffered scorn and humiliation.

(Jeremiah 15:16) 
Your words were found, and I consumed them. And Your word became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I am called by Your name, O Lord, God of hosts.

(Jeremiah 15:17) 
I did not sit with the assembly of those who mock or make merry, nor did I rejoice in the presence of Your powerful hand upon me. Instead, I sat alone, for You had filled me with Your stern warning of judgment.

(Jeremiah 15:18) 
Why has my pain become perpetual, and my wound incurable and refusing to heal? Have You become to me like a deceitful stream, like waters that fail when most needed and are therefore unfaithful?

(Jeremiah 15:19) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord: "If you return to Me, I will restore you, and you shall stand before My face. And if you separate the precious from the worthless in your message, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn to you and your message, but you must not turn to them and their ways."

(Jeremiah 15:20) 
And I will make you to this people a strong bronze wall. They will fight against you, but they will not prevail, because I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 15:21) 
And I will deliver you from the hand of evil men, and I will redeem you from the hand of the powerful.

(Jeremiah 16:1) 
And then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 16:2) 
"You shall not take a wife for yourself, and you shall have no sons or daughters in this place."

(Jeremiah 16:3) 
"For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and about their mothers who bore them, and about their fathers who fathered them in this land:"

(Jeremiah 16:4) 
"They will die of terrible diseases; they will not be mourned, nor will they be buried. Their bodies will become like dung spread upon the face of the earth. They will be consumed by sword and by famine. And their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth."

(Jeremiah 16:5) 
"For this is what the Lord says: 'Do not enter a house of feasting, nor go to mourn, nor offer them comfort. For I have taken my peace from all these people,' declares the Lord, 'along with my mercy and my compassion.'"

(Jeremiah 16:6) 
"Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried, nor will they be mourned. No one will cut themselves or shave their heads for them as a sign of grief."

(Jeremiah 16:7) 
"And no one will break bread for them in mourning to comfort them over the dead. No cup of consolation will be given to them for their father or their mother."

(Jeremiah 16:8) 
"You shall not enter a house of feasting to eat and drink with them either."

(Jeremiah 16:9) 
"For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Behold, I will remove from this place, before your very eyes and during your lifetime, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.'"

(Jeremiah 16:10) 
"And when you announce all these words to these people, and they say to you: 'Why has the Lord spoken all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? And what is our sin that we have sinned against the Lord our God?'"

(Jeremiah 16:11) 
"Then you shall say to them: 'Because your fathers abandoned me,' declares the Lord, 'and went after other gods, and served them, and worshiped them. They abandoned me and did not keep my law.'"

(Jeremiah 16:12) 
"But you have acted even worse than your fathers! For behold, each one of you walks according to the stubbornness of your own evil heart, refusing to listen to me."

(Jeremiah 16:13) 
"And I will cast you out from this land into a land which neither you nor your fathers have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, gods who will give you no rest."

(Jeremiah 16:14) 
"Therefore, behold, the days are coming,' declares the Lord, 'when it will no longer be said: "As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt!"'"

(Jeremiah 16:15) 
"But instead: 'As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where I had cast them!' For I will bring them back into their own land, which I gave to their fathers."

(Jeremiah 16:16) 
"Behold, I will send for many fishermen,' declares the Lord, 'and they will fish them out. And after that, I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down from every mountain and every hill, and out of the crevices of the rocks.'"

(Jeremiah 16:17) 
"For my eyes are upon all their ways. Nothing is hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my sight."

(Jeremiah 16:18) 
"And I will first repay them double for their iniquities and their sins, because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and with their abominations they have filled my inheritance."

(Jeremiah 16:19) 
"O Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of tribulation! To you, the nations will come from the farthest ends of the earth and say: 'Truly, our fathers inherited lies, worthless things that brought them no benefit.'"

(Jeremiah 16:20) 
"Can a man make gods for himself, when they are not truly gods?"

(Jeremiah 16:21) 
"Therefore, behold, I will make them know this time. I will show them my hand and my power, and they will know that my name is the Lord."

(Jeremiah 17:1) 
The sin of Judah has been etched into their very being with an iron stylus and a diamond point. It is engraved upon the tablet of their hearts, and upon the horns of the altars where they offer their sacrifices—a permanent sign of their idolatry.

(Jeremiah 17:2) 
Their own children will remember their altars of false worship and their sacred groves under every green tree, on every high hill where they committed these sins.

(Jeremiah 17:3) 
Your mountains—which are like a wilderness—and your strength, all your treasures, I will give them over to plunder. Your high places, where you committed idolatry, will be given over because of your sins in all your territories.

(Jeremiah 17:4) 
You will be forced to let go of your own inheritance, the land I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, because you have ignited a fire of My anger, and it will burn on and on, unceasingly.

(Jeremiah 17:5) 
The Lord says this: Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes his own human strength his confidence, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 17:6) 
For such a man will be like a desert broom bush in the arid wasteland; he will not even perceive when good things come. Instead, he will live in the parched places of the wilderness, in a salt land that is completely uninhabited and barren.

(Jeremiah 17:7) 
Blessed is the man who places his trust in the Lord, and whose total confidence is the Lord Himself.

(Jeremiah 17:8) 
And he will be like a tree that has been planted by flowing waters, sending out its roots by the stream. It will not fear when the summer's intense heat arrives, for its leaves will remain green. In a year of drought, it will not be anxious, nor will it stop producing its fruit.

(Jeremiah 17:9) 
The heart of man is twisted and perverse, and it is inscrutable—who can truly understand or know it fully?

(Jeremiah 17:10) 
I am the Lord, the One who deeply searches the heart and tests the innermost desires and intentions. I give to each person according to the way they live their life, and according to the fruit of their actions.

(Jeremiah 17:11) 
Just like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay, so is the person who gathers riches unjustly, not by righteous means. In the middle of his life, he will be forced to abandon them, and in the end, he will be exposed as a fool.

(Jeremiah 17:12) 
Your glorious throne, exalted from the very beginning of time, is the place where we are made holy by Your presence.

(Jeremiah 17:13) 
O Lord, You are the very hope of Israel! All who abandon You will be put to shame. Those who turn away from You will have their names written in the dust, forgotten and without hope, for they have abandoned the Lord, the true fountain of life-giving waters.

(Jeremiah 17:14) 
Heal me, O Lord, and then I will truly be healed. Save me, and then I will truly be saved, because You are the one I praise.

(Jeremiah 17:15) 
Look! These people say to me, "Where is the word of the Lord you speak of? Let it come to pass, if it is real!"

(Jeremiah 17:16) 
But I have not fled from being a shepherd, following You. I have not desired the day of human calamity, as You well know. What came out of my lips was always spoken correctly and truthfully in Your sight.

(Jeremiah 17:17) 
Do not become a terror to me; You are my strength in the day when I face affliction.

(Jeremiah 17:18) 
Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but let me not be shamed. Let them be terrified, but let me not be terrified. Bring upon them a day of calamity, and crush them with a double, overwhelming destruction.

(Jeremiah 18:1) 
The Lord spoke to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 18:2) 
"Go down to the potter’s house, and there you will hear My words."

(Jeremiah 18:3) 
So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working on his wheel.

(Jeremiah 18:4) 
But the vessel that the potter was shaping from clay with his hands was ruined. So he changed his mind and made another vessel, just as it seemed good to him, the potter, to do.

(Jeremiah 18:5) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 18:6) 
"Can I not deal with you, O house of Israel, as this potter deals with his clay?" says the Lord. "Behold, just as the clay is entirely in the hand of the potter, so are you entirely in My hand, O house of Israel."

(Jeremiah 18:7) 
"If I pronounce a judgment against a nation or against a kingdom—meaning I will uproot it, pull it down, and destroy it—"

(Jeremiah 18:8) 
"—if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns away from its evil, then I will change My mind concerning the evil I had planned to bring upon it."

(Jeremiah 18:9) 
"And if I pronounce a blessing upon a nation or upon a kingdom—meaning I will build it up and plant it—"

(Jeremiah 18:10) 
"—and that nation does evil in My sight, refusing to obey My voice, then I will change My mind concerning the good I had promised to do for it."

(Jeremiah 18:11) 
Now then, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: "Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am now forming a disaster against you and devising a plan to bring it upon you. Therefore, let each one of you turn away from your evil path, and correct your ways and your actions."

(Jeremiah 18:12) 
But they replied: "That is hopeless! We will go our own way, and each of us will act according to the stubborn wickedness of his own heart."

(Jeremiah 18:13) 
Therefore, the Lord says this: "Ask the other nations: who has ever heard of such a horrifying thing—this betrayal that the virgin Israel, My once-pure people, has committed?"

(Jeremiah 18:14) 
"Does the snow on the rocks of Lebanon ever melt away completely? Do the cold, gushing waters that flow from the mountains ever dry up?"

(Jeremiah 18:15) 
"Yet My people have forgotten Me; they offer sacrifices to worthless idols. They have stumbled in their ways, straying from the ancient paths that lead to life, choosing instead to walk on unpaved byways—a path that is not meant for public, righteous use—"

(Jeremiah 18:16) 
"—resulting in their land becoming a desolation, a perpetual object of scorn and horror. Everyone who passes by it will be utterly appalled and will shake their head in disbelief."

(Jeremiah 18:17) 
"Like a scorching desert wind, I will scatter them before their enemy. I will show them My back and not My face—meaning I will abandon them and not help them—on the day of their destruction."

(Jeremiah 18:18) 
Then they said: "Come, let us devise plots against Jeremiah. For we have our own priests who teach the Law, our own wise men who give counsel, and our own prophets who speak the word of God—we don't need *him*. Come, let us attack him with our tongues through false accusations and slander, and let us ignore everything he says."

(Jeremiah 18:19) 
Lord, pay attention to me, and hear the voice of my adversaries.

(Jeremiah 18:20) 
Is evil to be repaid for good? For they have dug a pit to trap me and take my life. Remember how I stood before You to intercede for them, to speak good on their behalf, and to turn Your indignation away from them.

(Jeremiah 18:21) 
Therefore, hand their children over to famine, and deliver them to the power of the sword. Let their wives become childless and widows. Let their men be slain by death, and their young men be run through by the sword in battle.

(Jeremiah 18:22) 
Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You suddenly bring a band of marauders upon them. For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.

(Jeremiah 18:23) 
But You, O Lord, know all of their plots against me, even those meant to bring about my death. Do not forgive their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from Your sight. Let them be cast down before You; in the time of Your wrath, let them be struck down.

(Jeremiah 19:1) 
The Lord says this: "Go and buy yourself an earthenware flask from a potter. Then take some of the elders of the people and some of the elder priests with you,

(Jeremiah 19:2) 
and go out to the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, which is near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There you will proclaim the words that I will speak to you.

(Jeremiah 19:3) 
And you shall say: 'Hear the word of the Lord, kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: Behold, I am bringing such a disaster upon this place that everyone who hears of it will have their ears ring with horror and shock.

(Jeremiah 19:4) 
This is because they have abandoned Me and have made this sacred place foreign and profane by sacrificing in it to foreign gods—gods unknown to them, their fathers, or the kings of Judah. They have also filled this place with the blood of innocent people.

(Jeremiah 19:5) 
They have built high places for Baal to burn their sons with fire as offerings to Baal—a practice I never commanded, never spoke of, and one that never even entered My mind.

(Jeremiah 19:6) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but instead, the Valley of Slaughter.

(Jeremiah 19:7) 
In this very place, I will shatter the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek to take their lives. I will also make their dead bodies food for the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth.

(Jeremiah 19:8) 
I will make this city a desolate waste and an object of scornful whistling. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will whistle in derision at all its wounds and devastation.

(Jeremiah 19:9) 
I will make them eat the flesh of their own sons and the flesh of their own daughters. Each person will eat the flesh of their neighbor during the siege and in the desperate distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives will confine them.

(Jeremiah 19:10) 
Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who have gone with you.

(Jeremiah 19:11) 
And you shall say to them: 'The Lord of hosts says this: Just so will I shatter this people and this city, like a potter's vessel that is broken beyond repair. They will be buried in Topheth because there will be no other place left to bury them.'

(Jeremiah 19:12) 
So will I do to this place, says the Lord, and to its inhabitants. I will make this city like Topheth itself.

(Jeremiah 19:13) 
The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become as unclean as the place of Topheth. This is because in all the houses, on whose rooftops they sacrificed to all the host of heaven—the astral deities—and poured out drink offerings to foreign gods, they have been defiled.

(Jeremiah 19:14) 
Then Jeremiah came back from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of the house of the Lord and spoke to all the people.

(Jeremiah 19:15) 
The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: 'Behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns every disaster that I have spoken against it. This is because they have stubbornly hardened their necks, refusing to listen to My words.'

(Jeremiah 20:1) 
Pashhur, the son of Immer, a priest who was appointed as the chief officer in the Temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah speaking these prophetic words.

(Jeremiah 20:2) 
So Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and then put him in stocks, which were located at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the Temple of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 20:3) 
The next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks. Jeremiah then said to him, "The Lord will no longer call you Pashhur; instead, He will call you Magor-Missabib"—meaning 'Terror on Every Side.'

(Jeremiah 20:4) 
For thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and you will witness it with your own eyes. I will also give all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them off to Babylon and strike them down with the sword.'

(Jeremiah 20:5) 
'And I will give all the wealth of this city, all its resources, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hands of their enemies. They will plunder them, take them away, and carry them off to Babylon.'

(Jeremiah 20:6) 
'And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried—you and all your friends, to whom you prophesied lies.'

(Jeremiah 20:7) 
Jeremiah then spoke to the Lord, saying, "You drew me in, O Lord, and I was drawn in to serve You. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed over me. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me."

(Jeremiah 20:8) 
"For whenever I speak, I must cry out about violence and devastation; I announce it continually. So the word of the Lord has become a constant source of reproach and mockery for me, all day long."

(Jeremiah 20:9) 
"But if I say, 'I will not remember Him, nor speak anymore in His Name,' then His word becomes in my heart like a burning fire, shut up in my bones. I become weary of holding it in, and I cannot endure it."

(Jeremiah 20:10) 
"For I hear the whisperings of many, and terror is on every side. They say, 'Denounce him! Let's denounce him!' All my former friends, who once watched my side, now wait for me to be deceived so they can catch me and take revenge."

(Jeremiah 20:11) 
"But the Lord is with me like a powerful warrior. Therefore, those who persecute me will stumble and will not prevail. They will be greatly ashamed, for they have failed to act wisely. Their disgrace will be eternal; it will never be forgotten."

(Jeremiah 20:12) 
"O Lord of hosts, You are the one who tests the righteous and sees into the depths of their minds and hearts. I beg You, let me see Your vengeance upon them, for I have entrusted my cause to You alone."

(Jeremiah 20:13) 
"Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For He has delivered the life of the poor and oppressed from the hand of the wicked and malicious."

(Jeremiah 20:14) 
"Cursed be the day on which I was born! May the day my mother bore me never be blessed!"

(Jeremiah 20:15) 
"Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, 'A male child is born to you!'—and thereby filled him with great joy."

(Jeremiah 20:16) 
"May that man become like the cities that the Lord overthrew without remorse or a change of heart! May he hear screams in the morning and wailing at noon!"

(Jeremiah 20:17) 
"Why did he not kill me while still in the womb, so that my mother's womb might have been my grave, and her womb an eternal conception?"

(Jeremiah 20:18) 
"Why did I come out of the womb at all, only to see trouble and sorrow, and to have my days consumed in confusion and shame?"

(Jeremiah 21:1) 
The Lord sent a message to Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur, son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to him, with a question for the prophet.

(Jeremiah 21:2) 
"Please ask the Lord for us, because Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, is fighting a war against us. We hope that the Lord might perform all His miracles as He has in the past, and make Nebuchadnezzar retreat from us."

(Jeremiah 21:3) 
And Jeremiah said to them, "You will tell King Zedekiah this:

(Jeremiah 21:4) 
'The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: "Listen, I am going to turn against you the very weapons of war that are in your hands—the weapons you are using to fight the King of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside your city walls. I will then gather these besieging forces into the very heart of this city.

(Jeremiah 21:5) 
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm. I will fight with righteous anger, with indignation, and with great fury.

(Jeremiah 21:6) 
I will strike down the inhabitants of this city—both people and their animals—and they will die from a terrible plague.

(Jeremiah 21:7) 
'After these things,' says the Lord, 'I will give Zedekiah, the King of Judah, along with his servants and his people—including anyone in this city who survives the plague, famine, and the sword—into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon. I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies, those who seek to take their lives. Nebuchadnezzar will strike them down without mercy, without sparing anyone, and without ceasing.'"

(Jeremiah 21:8) 
And to this people you are to say: 'The Lord says this: "Listen, I am now setting before you the path to life and the path to death.

(Jeremiah 21:9) 
Anyone who stays inside this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague. But anyone who goes out and deserts to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live. His life will be snatched away from danger, a bare escape, but he will live."

(Jeremiah 21:10) 
For I have set My face against this city for its destruction, not for its well-being,' says the Lord. 'It will be handed over to the King of Babylon, and he will burn it down with fire.'"

(Jeremiah 21:11) 
And regarding the house of the King of Judah, hear the word of the Lord:

(Jeremiah 21:12) 
'O house of David,' the Lord says this: 'Administer justice diligently and rescue the one who is oppressed from the hand of his accuser. Do this quickly, lest My indignation burst out like fire, consuming everything, and there be no one to extinguish it, because of the wickedness of your actions.

(Jeremiah 21:13) 
Listen, I am coming against you, O inhabitant of the valley—you who call yourself 'the rock of the plain,'” says the Lord. "You who say, 'Who can strike us down? Who can enter into our fortified homes?'"

(Jeremiah 21:14) 
'But I will punish you according to the consequences of your deeds,' says the Lord. 'And I will set fire to its dense forest—referring to the city and its inhabitants—and it will consume everything all around it.'"

(Jeremiah 22:1) 
The Lord God says this: 'Go down to the royal palace of the king of Judah, and speak this message there:''

(Jeremiah 22:2) 
'Say: "Listen to the message from the Lord God, O King of Judah, you who sit on the throne of King David, you and your royal officials, and all your people who come through these city gates."

(Jeremiah 22:3) 
The Lord God says: 'Do what is right and just. Rescue those who are robbed or unjustly oppressed from the power of their oppressors. Do not harm or oppress the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow. And do not shed innocent blood in this place.'

(Jeremiah 22:4) 
For if you faithfully carry out this command, then kings from the royal line of David will continue to enter through the gates of this palace. They will sit on David's throne, riding in chariots and on horses, along with their royal officials and all their people.

(Jeremiah 22:5) 
But if you do not listen to these words, the Lord God says: 'I have sworn by Myself that this royal palace will become a heap of ruins, utterly deserted.'

(Jeremiah 22:6) 
For the Lord God says this concerning the royal palace of the king of Judah: 'Even though you are as glorious to Me as the forested heights of Gilead or the majestic cedars of Lebanon—regions known for their splendor—I solemnly declare that I will turn you into a desolate wasteland, with cities left uninhabited.'

(Jeremiah 22:7) 
I will consecrate destroyers against you—each man with his weapons. They will cut down your choicest cedar timbers, and they will throw them into the fire.

(Jeremiah 22:8) 
Many foreign nations will pass by this city, and each one will ask his neighbor: 'Why has the Lord God done this to such a magnificent city?'

(Jeremiah 22:9) 
And the answer will be: 'Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord their God. They worshipped other foreign gods and served them instead of God.'

(Jeremiah 22:10) 
Do not weep for King Josiah, who has died naturally, nor mourn him too excessively. Instead, weep for King Shallum (Jehoahaz), who is being led away into exile. For he will never return to this land, nor will he ever see the land of his birth again.

(Jeremiah 22:11) 
For the Lord God says this concerning Shallum (also called Jehoahaz), the son of Josiah, King of Judah—he who reigned in place of his father Josiah, and who has departed from this place: 'He will never return here again.'

(Jeremiah 22:12) 
Instead, in the very place to which they have taken him captive, there he will die, and he will never see the land of his birth again.

(Jeremiah 22:13) 
Woe to the king who builds his royal palace through injustice, and his luxurious upper rooms without any regard for justice! He forces his neighbors to work for him for nothing, and he does not pay them for their labor.

(Jeremiah 22:14) 
Woe to the king who says: 'I will build myself a grand and spacious palace, with vast upper rooms!' He then makes its windows wide, and panels its ceilings with expensive cedar wood, and paints it with bright, lavish colors.

(Jeremiah 22:15) 
Do you truly believe you are a king merely because you outdo others in building with cedar? Did not your father, Josiah, eat and drink and enjoy life? Yet he also practiced justice and righteousness, and because of this, everything went well for him.

(Jeremiah 22:16) 
He defended the cause of the poor and the needy, ensuring they received justice, as if it were his own cause. Is this not truly what it means to know Me? declares the Lord God.

(Jeremiah 22:17) 
But your eyes and your heart are set on nothing but your own greed, on shedding innocent blood, on practicing oppression, and on committing constant injustice.

(Jeremiah 22:18) 
Therefore, the Lord God says this concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: 'No one will mourn him by saying, "Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!" No one will lament for him by crying, "Alas, my lord! Alas, his majesty!"'

(Jeremiah 22:19) 
He will be buried with the disgraceful burial of a donkey—his corpse will be dragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 22:20) 
O Jerusalem, go up to Lebanon and cry out! Raise your voice in Bashan! Call out from the heights of Abarim! For all your political allies have been shattered and destroyed.

(Jeremiah 22:21) 
I spoke to you when you were prosperous, but you defiantly said, 'I will not listen.' This has been your persistent way from your earliest youth, because you have never listened to My voice.

(Jeremiah 22:22) 
All your leaders will be swept away by the wind, scattered and destroyed. And your allies will be led into captivity. Then you will be shamed and utterly disgraced because of all your wickedness.

(Jeremiah 22:23) 
You who live in your cedar-paneled palaces, as if nesting securely among the majestic cedars of Lebanon—how terribly you will groan when the pains of judgment come upon you, pains like those of a woman in childbirth!

(Jeremiah 22:24) 
As surely as I live, declares the Lord God, even if Coniah (also called Jehoiachin), the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a cherished signet ring on My right hand, I would still tear you from it.

(Jeremiah 22:25) 
I will give you into the power of those who seek to kill you, into the power of those whose faces you dread: into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the power of the Chaldeans.

(Jeremiah 22:26) 
I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into a foreign land, a land where neither of you were born, and there you will both die.

(Jeremiah 22:27) 
And to the land to which they so deeply long to return, they will never come back.

(Jeremiah 22:28) 
Is this man Coniah just a despised and broken clay pot? Is he a vessel no longer fit for any use? Why are he and his offspring cast out and thrown into a land they have never known?

(Jeremiah 22:29) 
O land, O land, O land—listen closely to the message of the Lord God!

(Jeremiah 22:30) 
The Lord God says this: 'Record this man Coniah as childless, meaning he will have no royal heir. He is a man who will not prosper in his lifetime. For none of his descendants will ever sit on the throne of David, nor will any ever again rule with authority in Judah.'

(Jeremiah 23:1) 
“Woe to the shepherds who scatter and tear apart the flock of My pasture!” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:2) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Israel says to the shepherds who are supposed to feed My people: ‘You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and you have failed to care for them properly. So now, behold, I Myself will punish you for the evil of your actions and intentions,’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:3) 
“And I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands to which I have driven them away; and I will bring them back to their own pastures, and they will become fruitful and multiply.”

(Jeremiah 23:4) 
“And I will raise up new, good shepherds over them, and these shepherds will truly feed them. My flock will no longer be afraid or terrified, and not one of them will be missing from their number,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:5) 
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch—this will be a King who will reign, and He will be wise. He will execute justice and righteousness throughout the entire land.”

(Jeremiah 23:6) 
“In those days, Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in security. And this is the name by which they will call Him: ‘The Lord Our Righteousness.’”

(Jeremiah 23:7) 
“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when people will no longer swear by saying, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel up from the land of Egypt!’”

(Jeremiah 23:8) 
“...but rather, they will say, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up and brought in the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the other lands to which I had driven them!’ And they shall dwell securely in their own land.”

(Jeremiah 23:9) 
Regarding the false prophets, Jeremiah laments: “My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a man completely overcome by wine, because of the Lord and the sheer weight of His holy words.”

(Jeremiah 23:10) 
“For the land is filled with adulterers—those unfaithful to God. Because of God’s curse, the land mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. The course of their actions has become evil, and the strength of their deeds is not righteous.”

(Jeremiah 23:11) 
“For both prophet and priest have become defiled. Even in My own Temple, I have found their wickedness,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:12) 
“Therefore, their path will be like slippery ground in the deep darkness. They will be driven on and stumble headlong into it. For I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment and reckoning,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:13) 
“Among the prophets of Samaria, I saw something truly disgusting: they prophesied by the pagan god Baal and led My people Israel astray.”

(Jeremiah 23:14) 
“But among the prophets of Jerusalem, I have seen an even more shocking and appalling thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from their wickedness. To Me, all of them have become like Sodom, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”

(Jeremiah 23:15) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord of armies says concerning these prophets: ‘Behold, I will feed them bitter wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. For from the prophets of Jerusalem, a defilement has spread throughout the entire land.’”

(Jeremiah 23:16) 
“This is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you and deceiving you. They speak only the vision of their own deceitful hearts, and not a single word from the mouth of the Lord Himself.’”

(Jeremiah 23:17) 
“They say to those who blaspheme Me, ‘The Lord has spoken: “Peace will be to you.”’ And to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of their own heart, they have falsely declared, ‘No evil will come upon you.’”

(Jeremiah 23:18) 
“For who among them has truly stood in the private council of the Lord, so that he has genuinely seen and heard His word? Who has truly paid attention to His word and heard it?”

(Jeremiah 23:19) 
“Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord! His fury has gone forth like a powerful tempest, and it has fallen directly upon the heads of the wicked!”

(Jeremiah 23:20) 
“The fury of the Lord will not turn back until He has fully executed and completely accomplished the plans of His heart. In the final days, you will understand His purpose clearly.”

(Jeremiah 23:21) 
“I did not send these false prophets, yet they ran on their own initiative. I did not speak to them, yet they still prophesied.”

(Jeremiah 23:22) 
“If they had truly stood in My divine council, they would have certainly heard My words, and then they would have turned My people from their evil ways and from the wickedness of their deeds.”

(Jeremiah 23:23) 
“‘Am I a God who is only near at hand?’ declares the Lord. ‘And not a God who is also far off?’”

(Jeremiah 23:24) 
“‘If a man hides himself in secret places, will I not see him?’ declares the Lord. ‘Do I not fill the entire universe and the earth?’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:25) 
“I have heard what these prophets say, prophesying lies in My name and constantly declaring, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’”

(Jeremiah 23:26) 
“How long will this persist in the hearts of these prophets who prophesy lies—these prophets who speak only the deceptions of their own hearts?”

(Jeremiah 23:27) 
“These are the prophets who intend to make My people forget My name through the false dreams that each one tells to his neighbor, just as their fathers forgot My name because of the pagan god Baal.”

(Jeremiah 23:28) 
“Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream for what it truly is. But let him who has My true word speak My word faithfully and truthfully! What does worthless chaff have in common with nourishing wheat?” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:29) 
“‘Is not My word like a consuming fire?’ declares the Lord. ‘And like a mighty hammer that shatters rock?’”

(Jeremiah 23:30) 
“Therefore, behold, I am against these prophets,” declares the Lord, “who steal My words, each one from his neighbor, claiming them as their own!”

(Jeremiah 23:31) 
“Behold, I am against these prophets,” declares the Lord, “who use their own tongues to speak and then falsely declare, ‘Thus says the Lord!’”

(Jeremiah 23:32) 
“Behold, I am against these prophets of lying dreams,” declares the Lord, “who have recounted them and have deceived My people with their lies and with their empty, baseless claims. I did not send them, nor did I command them, and they are of absolutely no benefit to this people,” declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 23:33) 
“Therefore, if this people, or a prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the “burden” of the Lord?’—that is, the prophetic word or oracle—then you shall say to them: ‘You yourselves are the burden! And I will cast you off completely,’ declares the Lord.”

(Jeremiah 23:34) 
“And as for the prophet, or priest, or anyone among the people who still mockingly says, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ I will severely punish that person and his household.”

(Jeremiah 23:35) 
“Instead, this is what you should say, each one to his neighbor and to his brother: ‘What answer has the Lord given?’ and ‘What has the Lord truly spoken?’”

(Jeremiah 23:36) 
“And the phrase ‘the burden of the Lord’ you shall mention no more, because each man’s own careless words will become his actual burden. For you are perverting the true words of the living God, the Lord of armies, our God!”

(Jeremiah 23:37) 
“This is what you should say to the prophet: ‘What answer has the Lord given you?’ and ‘What has the Lord truly spoken?’”

(Jeremiah 23:38) 
“But if you persist in saying, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ because you have said this very phrase—‘The burden of the Lord’—even after I specifically commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not say, “The burden of the Lord!”’—”

(Jeremiah 23:39) 
“Therefore, behold, I Myself will surely take you up and throw you away—remove you entirely from My presence—along with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers.”

(Jeremiah 23:40) 
“And I will inflict upon you an everlasting reproach and an everlasting disgrace, which will never be erased from memory.”

(Jeremiah 24:1) 
The Lord showed me a vision: and behold, there were two baskets of figs placed directly before the Lord's temple. This vision came after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had already carried away Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, who was the king of Judah, along with his princes, the craftsmen, and the smiths from Jerusalem, bringing them as captives to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 24:2) 
One basket contained figs that were exceedingly good, like the very first figs to ripen in the season. The other basket contained figs that were exceedingly bad, so rotten they could not possibly be eaten.

(Jeremiah 24:3) 
Then the Lord spoke to me, saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I answered, "I see figs: the good figs are very, very good; and the bad figs are very, very bad, so rotten that they cannot be eaten."

(Jeremiah 24:4) 
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

(Jeremiah 24:5) 
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Just as these good figs represent something positive, so I will look with favor upon the exiles of Judah whom I have sent from this place—from their homeland, into the land of the Chaldeans—for their ultimate good."

(Jeremiah 24:6) 
"And I will fix My gaze upon them for their well-being and favor, and I will bring them back to this land of Judah. I will build them up, and I will not tear them down; I will plant them firmly, and I will not uproot them."

(Jeremiah 24:7) 
"And I will give them a transformed heart, a spiritual capacity to know Me truly—to understand that I am the Lord. Then they will truly be My people, and I will be their God, because they will turn back to Me with a single, undivided heart."

(Jeremiah 24:8) 
"And as for the very bad figs, the ones so rotten that they cannot be eaten—thus says the Lord: So will I treat Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his princes, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who remained in this land, and those who chose to live in the land of Egypt instead of going into exile."

(Jeremiah 24:9) 
"I will make them a source of trouble and distress for all the kingdoms of the earth. They will become a scandal and a byword, a proverb and a curse in all the places to which I will drive them away."

(Jeremiah 24:10) 
"And I will send upon them the sword, and famine, and plague, until they are completely consumed and swept away from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors."

(Jeremiah 25:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah—that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 25:2) 
The prophet Jeremiah spoke this message to all the people of Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem, saying:

(Jeremiah 25:3) 
From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, until this very day—which is now the twenty-third year—the word of the Lord has come to me. I have spoken to you persistently, rising early each morning to speak, but you have not listened.

(Jeremiah 25:4) 
Furthermore, the Lord has sent all His servants, the prophets, to you, rising early and sending them repeatedly. Yet, you have not listened, nor have you inclined your ear to hear them.

(Jeremiah 25:5) 
Their message was always: 'Turn back, each one of you, from your evil way and from your wicked thoughts. Then you will live in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers, for all generations, forever.'

(Jeremiah 25:6) 
They also said: 'Do not follow other gods to serve them or worship them. Do not provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, and then I will not afflict you.'

(Jeremiah 25:7) 
But you did not listen to Me, says the Lord. Instead, you provoked Me to wrath with the works of your hands, bringing harm upon yourselves.

(Jeremiah 25:8) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Because you have not listened to My words—'

(Jeremiah 25:9) 
Behold, I will send for and gather all the tribes from the north,' says the Lord. 'I will send for Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, My servant, and I will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants, and against all the nations that surround it. I will utterly destroy them and make them an object of horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.'

(Jeremiah 25:10) 
'I will take away from them the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstone grinding grain, and the light of the lamp that shines.'

(Jeremiah 25:11) 
'And all this land will become a desolation and an object of horror. These nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.'

(Jeremiah 25:12) 
'When the seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' says the Lord, 'for their iniquity. I will also punish the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.'

(Jeremiah 25:13) 
'I will bring upon that land all My words that I have spoken against it—everything that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.'

(Jeremiah 25:14) 
'For many nations and great kings have subjugated them. I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.'

(Jeremiah 25:15) 
For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Take this cup of the wine of My wrath from My hand and make all the nations, to whom I send you, drink from it.'

(Jeremiah 25:16) 
'They will drink and stagger and act madly because of the sword that I will send among them.'

(Jeremiah 25:17) 
So I took the cup from the hand of the Lord and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it.

(Jeremiah 25:18) 
This included Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an object of horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day.

(Jeremiah 25:19) 
I also made Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people drink.

(Jeremiah 25:20) 
And all the mixed peoples, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines—including Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod—all drank.

(Jeremiah 25:21) 
Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:22) 
All the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the islands across the sea also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:23) 
Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and all who shave the corners of their hair, drank too.

(Jeremiah 25:24) 
All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed peoples who live in the desert also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:25) 
All the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media also drank.

(Jeremiah 25:26) 
All the kings of the north, near and far, one against another, and all the kingdoms of the earth that are on the face of the universe drank. And the king of Sheshach—that is, Babylon—will drink after them all.

(Jeremiah 25:27) 
Then you will say to them: 'This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, vomit, fall, and do not rise again because of the sword that I will send among you.'

(Jeremiah 25:28) 
If they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them: 'This is what the Lord of Hosts says: You shall surely drink!'

(Jeremiah 25:29) 
'For behold, I am beginning to bring affliction on the city where My Name is invoked—Jerusalem. And do you think you, as if innocent, will be delivered from misfortune? No, you will not be delivered! For I am calling for a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,' says the Lord of Hosts.

(Jeremiah 25:30) 
Therefore, you are to prophesy all these words to them and say to them: 'The Lord will roar from on high; He will utter His voice from His holy dwelling. He will roar mightily over His habitation. With a shout like those treading the winepress, He will cry out against all the inhabitants of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:31) 
'The sound will reach to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has a controversy with the nations. He has a case against all flesh. He will deliver the wicked to the sword,' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 25:32) 
This is what the Lord of Hosts says: 'Behold, disaster will go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm will arise from the farthest ends of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:33) 
'And those slain by the Lord on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be lamented, nor gathered, nor buried; they will lie as dung on the surface of the earth.'

(Jeremiah 25:34) 
Wail, you shepherds, and cry out! Roll in the dust, you chiefs of the flock! For your days are fulfilled for you to be slaughtered, and I will scatter you, and you will fall like precious vessels broken into pieces.

(Jeremiah 25:35) 
Escape will perish from the shepherds, and salvation from the chiefs of the flock.

(Jeremiah 25:36) 
A sound of crying from the shepherds, and a howling from the chiefs of the flock, because the Lord has devastated their pastures.

(Jeremiah 25:37) 
The fields of peace have been silenced because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 25:38) 
He has left His lair like a lion. Indeed, their land has become a desolation because of the fierceness of the oppressor's wrath, and because of the fierceness of His burning anger.

(Jeremiah 26:26:1) 
In the early days of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, King of Judah, this message came from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 26:26:2) 
Thus says the Lord: Stand in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and speak to all the cities of Judah who come to worship in the Lord’s house. Tell them all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them, and do not hold back a single word.

(Jeremiah 26:26:3) 
Perhaps they will listen to my words and turn back, each person from their wicked way of life. If they do, then I will relent and not bring the disaster I intend for them, which I planned because of the evil of their deeds.

(Jeremiah 26:26:4) 
You shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: If you do not listen to Me and walk in My law which I have given to you—

(Jeremiah 26:26:5) 
and if you do not listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you repeatedly, rising up early to send them, but you have not heeded them—

(Jeremiah 26:26:6) 
then I will make this house (the Temple) like Shiloh (a place of past destruction), and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

(Jeremiah 26:26:7) 
The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the Lord’s house.

(Jeremiah 26:26:8) 
When Jeremiah had finished speaking everything the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, shouting, “You must surely die!”

(Jeremiah 26:26:9) 
They demanded, “Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying that this house (the Temple) will become like Shiloh, and that this city will be made desolate, without an inhabitant?” And all the people gathered together against Jeremiah in the Lord’s house.

(Jeremiah 26:26:10) 
When the princes of Judah heard these words, they came up from the king’s house to the Lord’s house and sat down at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord’s house to hear the matter.

(Jeremiah 26:26:11) 
And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, declaring, “This man deserves a sentence of death! For he has prophesied against this city, just as you have heard with your own ears.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:12) 
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, “The Lord sent me on a mission to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:13) 
Now therefore, make your ways good and amend your deeds. Obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will relent from the disaster that He has spoken against you.

(Jeremiah 26:26:14) 
But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me whatever seems good and right in your eyes.

(Jeremiah 26:26:15) 
Nevertheless, know and understand this: if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants. For truly, the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.

(Jeremiah 26:26:16) 
Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:17) 
And some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:

(Jeremiah 26:26:18) 
“Micah the Morasthite was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah. He said to all the people of Judah, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the Temple shall be like the wooded high places.’

(Jeremiah 26:26:19) 
Did Hezekiah, king of Judah, and all Judah put him to death for this prophecy? No! Instead, he feared the Lord and entreated the favor of the Lord, and the Lord relented from the disaster which He had spoken against them. And we ourselves are about to do great harm to our own souls by seeking to kill this prophet.”

(Jeremiah 26:26:20) 
There was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 26:26:21) 
But when King Jehoiakim, and all his mighty men, and all the princes heard these words, the king sought to put him to death. When Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and he fled and went into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 26:26:22) 
Then King Jehoiakim sent men into Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and other men with him into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 26:26:23) 
And they brought Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. The king then struck him down with a sword and cast his dead body into the burial ground of the common people.

(Jeremiah 26:26:24) 
Nevertheless, the hand of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, was with Jeremiah, so that he was not delivered into the hands of the people to be put to death. Ahikam’s influence protected Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 27:1) 
It was in the beginning of the reign of Joakim, the son of Josiah, who was the king of Judah, that this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 27:2) 
The Lord said to me: "Make yourself literal chains and a wooden yoke, and then put them on your own neck." This was to be a visible sign of a coming servitude.

(Jeremiah 27:3) 
Then send these chains and this yoke to the kings of Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and Tyre, and Sidon. Send them through the hand of the messengers who are coming to Jerusalem, to King Zedekiah of Judah, probably for a council of alliance.

(Jeremiah 27:4) 
You shall command these messengers to say to their rulers: "This is what the Lord of all creation, the God of Israel, says. This is what you must tell your own rulers:"

(Jeremiah 27:5) 
"It was I who made the earth, and its people, and all the animals on the face of the earth, by my great strength and with my powerful outstretched arm. And I have given this earth to whomever I choose to give it to, to rule over."

(Jeremiah 27:6) 
"And now, I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, who is my appointed servant. Moreover, I have also given him the wild animals of the field, so that they too will serve him."

(Jeremiah 27:7) 
"All nations will serve him, and his son, and his grandson. They will serve him until the appointed time comes for his own land and for himself. Many nations and great kings will serve him."

(Jeremiah 27:8) 
"But any nation or kingdom that will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation. I will visit them with the sword, and with famine, and with plague,' says the Lord, 'until I have completely destroyed them by his hand.'"

(Jeremiah 27:9) 
"Therefore, do not listen to your false prophets, nor your diviners, nor your dreamers, nor your soothsayers, nor your sorcerers, who speak to you saying: 'You will not serve the king of Babylon!'"

(Jeremiah 27:10) 
"For they are prophesying a lie to you. Their goal is to make you be removed far from your own land, so that I may cast you out, and you may utterly perish."

(Jeremiah 27:11) 
"However, the nation that *does* put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him—I will leave that nation in its own land,' says the Lord, 'and its people will be able to cultivate it and live in it peacefully.'"

(Jeremiah 27:12) 
I also spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah according to all these same words, saying: "Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Serve him and his people, and you will live."

(Jeremiah 27:13) 
Why should you and your people die by the sword, and by famine, and by plague, just as the Lord has spoken against any nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon? Do not bring this destruction upon yourselves.

(Jeremiah 27:14) 
Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you: 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' because they are speaking a complete lie to you.

(Jeremiah 27:15) 
"For I have not sent them," says the Lord. "And they are prophesying falsely in my name, so that I may cast you out, and both you and your prophets who prophesy to you may perish."

(Jeremiah 27:16) 
I also spoke to the priests and to this people, saying: "This is what the Lord says: 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you, saying: "Behold, the sacred vessels of the Lord will quickly be brought back from Babylon now!" because they are prophesying a lie to you.'"

(Jeremiah 27:17) 
"Do not listen to them! Instead, serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. For why should this city become a desolate ruin?"

(Jeremiah 27:18) 
"But if they truly are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is truly in them, then let them now make supplication to the Lord of all creation! Let them pray that the vessels which are still left in the House of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, may not also be carried off to Babylon."

(Jeremiah 27:19) 
For this is what the Lord of all creation says concerning the great pillars, and concerning the large bronze basin called 'the Sea,' and concerning the bases that supported the lavers, and concerning the rest of the vessels that still remain in this city.

(Jeremiah 27:20) 
These are the items that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did not take when he carried away Jeconiah, the son of Joakim, who was the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 27:21) 
Indeed, this is what the Lord of all creation, the God of Israel, says concerning those vessels that are still left in the House of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:

(Jeremiah 27:22) 
"They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will remain until the day I intervene and visit them," says the Lord. "Then I will cause them to be brought back from Babylon and fully restored to this holy place."

(Jeremiah 28:1) 
It came to pass in that year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, specifically in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azur, a prophet from Gibeon, came to me, Jeremiah, in the Temple of the Lord, speaking before the priests and all the people.

(Jeremiah 28:2) 
Hananiah said: “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon!

(Jeremiah 28:3) 
Within two full years, I will cause all the sacred vessels of the Temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took from this very place and carried away to Babylon, to be brought back to this place.

(Jeremiah 28:4) 
And King Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with all the people of Judah who were carried into captivity in Babylon—I will bring them back to this place,” says the Lord. “For I will shatter the yoke of the king of Babylon.”

(Jeremiah 28:5) 
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet, in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the Temple of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 28:6) 
Jeremiah the prophet said: “So be it! May the Lord do as you have said! May the Lord fulfill your words which you have prophesied, that He may bring back the sacred vessels to the Temple of the Lord, and all the exiles from Babylon to this very place.

(Jeremiah 28:7) 
Nevertheless, hear this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.

(Jeremiah 28:8) 
The prophets who were before me and before you, from ancient times, prophesied concerning many lands and great kingdoms about war, disaster, and famine.

(Jeremiah 28:9) 
But the prophet who prophesies peace—when his word comes to pass and what he has prophesied is fulfilled, then it will be known if the Lord truly sent that prophet.”

(Jeremiah 28:10) 
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.

(Jeremiah 28:11) 
And he said in the presence of all the people: “Thus says the Lord: So will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the necks of all the nations within two full years.” After this declaration, the people were encouraged to trust Hananiah's words.

(Jeremiah 28:12) 
And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.

(Jeremiah 28:13) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

(Jeremiah 28:14) 
“Go and say to Hananiah: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place, you will have a yoke of iron.

(Jeremiah 28:15) 
For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have placed an iron yoke upon the neck of all these nations, so that they must serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and they will serve him. Moreover, I have also given him the wild animals of the field.’”

(Jeremiah 28:16) 
And Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet: “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, and by your lies, you have made this people put their trust in a falsehood.

(Jeremiah 28:17) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you shall die, because you have spoken words of rebellion against the Lord.’”

(Jeremiah 28:18) 
And Hananiah the prophet died that same year, in the seventh month, just as Jeremiah had prophesied.

(Jeremiah 29:1) 
These are the words from the book that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem. It was addressed to the remaining elders who had been taken into exile, as well as to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had led from Jerusalem into Babylon.

(Jeremiah 29:2) 
This message was sent after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and skilled workers had all been taken from Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 29:3) 
The letter was carried by Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah. These men had been sent by King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, in Babylon. The letter said:

(Jeremiah 29:4) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles, all of whom I caused to be taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:

(Jeremiah 29:5) 
Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat the fruit they produce.

(Jeremiah 29:6) 
Take wives and have sons and daughters. Give your sons wives, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there in Babylon, and do not let your numbers diminish.

(Jeremiah 29:7) 
Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city where I have caused you to be taken into exile. Pray to the Lord for that city, because your own peace will depend on its peace.

(Jeremiah 29:8) 
For this is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Do not let your own prophets who are among you, or your diviners, deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you cause to have or interpret for yourselves.

(Jeremiah 29:9) 
For they prophesy lies to you in My name. I have not sent them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:10) 
For this is what the Lord says: When Babylon's seventy years begin to be completed, I will visit you. I will bring about My good promise to you, that I will bring you back to this place.

(Jeremiah 29:11) 
For I know My plans, which I plan for you, says the Lord. They are plans of peace and not of affliction, to give you a hopeful future and an expected end.

(Jeremiah 29:12) 
Then you will call upon Me, and you will come and pray to Me, and I will hear you.

(Jeremiah 29:13) 
You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart.

(Jeremiah 29:14) 
And I will be found by you, says the Lord. I will restore you from your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have driven you out, says the Lord. I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to go into exile.

(Jeremiah 29:15) 
You say, 'The Lord has raised up for us prophets in Babylon!'

(Jeremiah 29:16) 
But this is what the Lord says concerning the king who sits on David's throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city—your brethren who did not go out with you into exile:

(Jeremiah 29:17) 
This is what the Lord of Armies says: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, and famine, and pestilence. I will make them like vile figs, which cannot be eaten because they are so bad.

(Jeremiah 29:18) 
I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence. I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, an astonishment, a hiss, and a reproach among all the nations to which I have driven them out.

(Jeremiah 29:19) 
This will happen because they have not listened to My words, says the Lord. They did not hear the messages I sent to them by My servants the prophets, though I was diligent in sending them. And you yourselves did not listen, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:20) 
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles, all whom I have sent from Jerusalem into Babylon.

(Jeremiah 29:21) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and he will strike them down before your very eyes.

(Jeremiah 29:22) 
And from them will be taken a curse by all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon. They will say, 'May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon burned in the fire!'

(Jeremiah 29:23) 
This will happen because they have committed foolishness in Israel. They have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken a word falsely in My name, which I did not command them. I am the Judge and the Witness, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 29:24) 
And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say:

(Jeremiah 29:25) 
This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the other priests, saying:

(Jeremiah 29:26) 
'The Lord has appointed you as priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, so that you should be an officer over every madman and prophet, and should put him in the stocks and in prison!'

(Jeremiah 29:27) 
'So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you?'

(Jeremiah 29:28) 
Shemaiah's letter continued: 'Because for this very reason he sent to us in Babylon, saying: 'It is a long time; build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.''

(Jeremiah 29:29) 
Then Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 29:30) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 29:31) 
Send a message to all the exiles, saying: 'This is what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has caused you to trust in a lie,'

(Jeremiah 29:32) 
'therefore this is what the Lord says: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for My people, says the Lord, because he has spoken rebellion against the Lord.'

(Jeremiah 30:1) 
This is the prophetic message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 30:2) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Write down all the words I have spoken to you in a scroll, for future generations.'

(Jeremiah 30:3) 
For behold, days are surely coming, declares the Lord, when I will reverse the captivity and restore My people, both Israel and Judah, declares the Lord. I will bring them back to the very land that I gave to their ancestors, and they will possess it once again, in lasting peace.

(Jeremiah 30:4) 
These, then, are the specific words that the Lord has spoken concerning both the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.

(Jeremiah 30:5) 
For this is what the Lord says: 'We have heard a terrifying cry, a sound of utter dread and not of peace.'

(Jeremiah 30:6) 
Ask now, and observe: can a man give birth? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labor, and every face turned pale with bitter anguish, as if in the throes of death?

(Jeremiah 30:7) 
Alas! For that day is great and terrible; there is no other like it. It is a time of extreme distress for Jacob—a period of unparalleled tribulation for God's chosen people—yet, in the end, he will be saved out of it.

(Jeremiah 30:8) 
And it will come to pass in that day, declares the Lord of hosts, that I will break the yoke of foreign oppression from your neck and tear off your bonds. Strangers will no longer make you their slaves or rule over you.

(Jeremiah 30:9) 
Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king—the Messiah, the true King from David's line—whom I will raise up for them to rule eternally.

(Jeremiah 30:10) 
Therefore, do not fear, My servant Jacob, declares the Lord, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from a distant land of exile, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return, find rest and security, and thrive, and no one will make him afraid or cause him terror.

(Jeremiah 30:11) 
For I am with you, declares the Lord, to save you. I will bring to a complete and utter end all the nations among whom I have scattered you. But I will not bring you to an utter end; rather, I will discipline you with precise justice, and I will by no means spare you as if you were innocent of sin.

(Jeremiah 30:12) 
For this is what the Lord says: 'Your brokenness seems incurable; your wound is a most grievous affliction.'

(Jeremiah 30:13) 
There is no one to plead your case or to bring about your healing; among all those who once claimed to love you, no one has truly cared for your recovery.

(Jeremiah 30:14) 
All your former allies and lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you out now in your distress. For I myself have struck you with the blow of an enemy, with cruel chastisement, because of the multitude of your iniquities and the severity of your hardened sins.

(Jeremiah 30:15) 
Why do you cry out over your crushing blow? Your pain seems incurable. Because of the multitude of your iniquities and your severe sins, I have done these things to you; this is the consequence of your actions.

(Jeremiah 30:16) 
Therefore, all who devour you will themselves be devoured; and all your adversaries, every single one of your enemies, will be led away into captivity. Those who plundered you will become plunder, and all who ravaged you I will give over to utter desolation and ruination.

(Jeremiah 30:17) 
For I will restore health to you and heal you of your deep wounds, declares the Lord, because they have called you 'Outcast Zion,' saying, 'This is Zion, and there is no one who cares for her or seeks her welfare.'

(Jeremiah 30:18) 
Thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob's dwellings and have compassion on his tents, restoring them to their former glory. The city will be rebuilt on its ancient mound, and the Holy Temple will be established according to its proper design and divine order.'

(Jeremiah 30:19) 
From them will emanate songs of thanksgiving and the joyful sound of those who celebrate. I will multiply their numbers, and they will not decrease; I will bring them glory, and they will not be diminished or brought low.

(Jeremiah 30:20) 
And their children will be as they were in days of old, and their community will be established and secure before My presence. I will then visit My judgment upon all who oppress them and cause them tribulation.

(Jeremiah 30:21) 
Their ruler will be one of their own, a native, and their sovereign will come forth from their midst. I will bring him near, and he will approach Me directly. For who is this, declares the Lord, who would dare to risk his very life and dedicate his heart to draw near to Me as an intermediary?

(Jeremiah 30:22) 
And you will once again be My people, and I will truly be your God, in a renewed covenant.

(Jeremiah 30:23) 
Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord, His fierce wrath bursting forth, a continuing storm, will come crashing down upon the heads of the wicked.

(Jeremiah 30:24) 
The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until He has accomplished and completely carried out the intentions and purposes of His heart. In the last days, you will understand these things clearly and fully.

(Jeremiah 31:1) 
In that time, the Lord declares, I will be the God of all the tribes of Israel, and they will be My people.

(Jeremiah 31:2) 
This is what the Lord says: The people who survived the sword found grace and favor in the desert. Israel will journey to its place of rest.

(Jeremiah 31:3) 
The Lord appeared to them from far away. He said, 'I have loved you, My people, with an everlasting love, a love that continues forever. That is why I have drawn you to Myself with steadfast mercy.'

(Jeremiah 31:4) 
And I will build you up again, and you will be built up, O virgin Israel, a nation restored to purity. You will again adorn yourself with your tambourines, and you will go forth in the joyful dance of those celebrating.

(Jeremiah 31:5) 
You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. Those who plant them will enjoy their fruits, and they will cultivate them securely, free from fear.

(Jeremiah 31:6) 
For there will be a day when the watchmen on the mountain of Ephraim will call out, saying: 'Arise! Let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God!'

(Jeremiah 31:7) 
For this is what the Lord says: Sing with great joy over Jacob, and shout among the chief nations. Proclaim, praise, and say: 'Save, O Lord, Your people, the remnant of Israel!'

(Jeremiah 31:8) 
Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and the one giving birth, all together—a great assembly of those returning here.

(Jeremiah 31:9) 
They will come with weeping for their past sins, but I will lead them with comfort. I will guide them by streams of water on a straight path where they will not stumble. For I have become a Father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn son, treated with special favor.

(Jeremiah 31:10) 
Hear the word of the Lord, O nations, and declare it in the distant islands, and say: 'He who scattered Israel will gather him, and He will guard him like a shepherd guards his flock.'

(Jeremiah 31:11) 
For the Lord has redeemed Jacob and has set him free from the hand of one stronger than himself.

(Jeremiah 31:12) 
And they will come and sing praises on Mount Zion. They will stream together to receive the good things from the Lord: abundant grain, new wine, and oil, and the young of flocks and herds. Their souls will be like a well-watered garden, and they will hunger no more, neither physically nor spiritually.

(Jeremiah 31:13) 
Then the virgin nation will rejoice in the dance, and young men and old men will celebrate together. For I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and make them glad instead of sad.

(Jeremiah 31:14) 
And I will satisfy the souls of the priests with rich abundance, and My people will be filled with My good things, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:15) 
This is what the Lord says: A voice is heard in Ramah, a sound of bitter lamentation, weeping, and deep sorrow. Rachel is weeping for her children and refuses to be comforted for them, because they are no longer present.

(Jeremiah 31:16) 
This is what the Lord says: Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears. For there is a reward for your labor and suffering, declares the Lord. Your children will return from the land of the enemy.

(Jeremiah 31:17) 
And there is hope for your future, declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own territory and borders.

(Jeremiah 31:18) 
I have clearly heard Ephraim lamenting: 'You have disciplined me, and I have learned my lesson like an untamed young bull that must be broken. Turn me back to You, and I will be restored, for You are the Lord my God.'

(Jeremiah 31:19) 
Indeed, after You turned me back, I repented. And after You showed me my errors, I struck my thigh in deep regret and sorrow. I was ashamed and disgraced, for I bore the reproach and consequences of my youthful rebellion.

(Jeremiah 31:20) 
Is not Ephraim My precious son? Is he not a delightful child to Me? For as often as I speak concerning him, I still remember him with love and tenderness. Because of this, My innermost being yearns for him; I will surely have abundant mercy on him, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:21) 
Set up signposts for yourself, place markers for guidance to the way back. Direct your heart toward the straight path, the way in which you once walked obediently. Return, O virgin Israel, return to your cities.

(Jeremiah 31:22) 
How long will you waver and wander aimlessly in your desires, O faithless daughter? For the Lord has created a new thing on the earth: A woman will encompass a man. This signifies a unique and unprecedented new order established by God, often understood as a spiritual reversal or a prophecy pointing towards the Incarnation of Christ.

(Jeremiah 31:23) 
This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their captivity: 'May the Lord bless you, O dwelling place of righteousness, O holy mountain of Zion!'

(Jeremiah 31:24) 
And Judah and all its cities will dwell there together, both farmers and those who lead flocks.

(Jeremiah 31:25) 
For I have satisfied the thirsty soul, and I have filled every hungry soul with good things.

(Jeremiah 31:26) 
At this, I awoke, as if from a deep vision or a blessed sleep, and I looked around. My sleep had been sweet and refreshing to me.

(Jeremiah 31:27) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of men and the seed of animals, causing them to multiply abundantly.

(Jeremiah 31:28) 
And just as I watched over them with vigilance to pluck up, to tear down, to demolish, to destroy, and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, declares the Lord. My active hand will be for their good.

(Jeremiah 31:29) 
In those days, they will no longer say the proverb: 'The fathers ate sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on edge,' blaming past generations for their own suffering.

(Jeremiah 31:30) 
Instead, each one will die for his own iniquity. Every person who eats sour grapes—his own teeth will be set on edge, for he will bear the consequences of his own actions.

(Jeremiah 31:31) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

(Jeremiah 31:32) 
This new covenant will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt—that covenant which they broke and rendered void, even though I was their Lord and Master, declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 31:33) 
But this will be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put My law within their inner being, and I will write it on their hearts, making it an internal spiritual guide. And I will be their God, and they will be My people.

(Jeremiah 31:34) 
And no longer will each man need to teach his neighbor, or each man teach his brother, saying: 'Know the Lord!' For they will all know Me intimately, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more at all.

(Jeremiah 31:35) 
This is what the Lord says, who gives the sun for the light of day, and the moon and stars for the light of night; who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the Lord of hosts is His name, indicating His power over all creation.

(Jeremiah 31:36) 
If these fixed laws of nature for the sun, moon, and stars should cease from before Me, declares the Lord, then also the offspring of Israel will cease from being a nation before Me for all days. This is a promise of Israel's eternal existence as a people.

(Jeremiah 31:37) 
This is what the Lord says: If the universe above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I would also cast away all the offspring of Israel because of all they have done, declares the Lord. As the former is impossible, so is the latter.

(Jeremiah 31:38) 
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt for the Lord, extending from the Tower of Hananeel all the way to the Corner Gate.

(Jeremiah 31:39) 
And the measuring line will go out further, beyond the normal boundary, encompassing all the hill of Gareb and encircling Goath.

(Jeremiah 31:40) 
And the entire valley of dead bodies and ashes, a place once of waste and defilement, and all the region of Hammeel up to the Kidron Valley, and as far as the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, will be holy to the Lord. It will not be uprooted or destroyed again, ever.

(Jeremiah 32:1) 
The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah—which was also the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign.

(Jeremiah 32:2) 
At that time, the Babylonian king's army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was located at the king of Judah’s palace.

(Jeremiah 32:3) 
King Zedekiah of Judah had locked Jeremiah up, asking, 'Why do you prophesy, saying: ‘This is what the Lord says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it’?'

(Jeremiah 32:4) 
‘And King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; instead, he will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He will speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye.’

(Jeremiah 32:5) 
‘He will lead Zedekiah away to Babylon, and Zedekiah will remain there until I pay him attention,’ declares the Lord. ‘If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will have no success at all.’

(Jeremiah 32:6) 
Then Jeremiah said: 'The word of the Lord came to me, saying:'

(Jeremiah 32:7) 
‘Listen, Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you with an offer. He will tell you to buy his field, which is in Anathoth, because you have the right to redeem it by your family connection.’

(Jeremiah 32:8) 
Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard, just as the Lord had foretold. He said to me, ‘Buy my field that is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin. You have the right to inherit it and to buy it. So take possession of it!’ And I understood that this was indeed the word from the Lord.

(Jeremiah 32:9) 
So I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel, which was in Anathoth. I weighed out the silver for him—seven shekels and ten pieces of silver.

(Jeremiah 32:10) 
I wrote the details in a deed, sealed it, and had witnesses sign. Then I weighed out the money on the scales.

(Jeremiah 32:11) 
Then I took the deed of purchase—both the sealed copy and the unsealed copy—in accordance with the customs and legal requirements.

(Jeremiah 32:12) 
I handed the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, the son of Maaseiah. This was done in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who had signed the purchase deed, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard.

(Jeremiah 32:13) 
And I instructed Baruch in their presence, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:14) 
‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents—this sealed purchase deed and this unsealed document—and put them in a clay jar so they may last for many days.’

(Jeremiah 32:15) 
‘For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought and owned in this land.’

(Jeremiah 32:16) 
After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:17) 
‘Ah, Sovereign Lord, God! Behold, You created the universe and the earth by Your great power and Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.’

(Jeremiah 32:18) 
‘You show loving-kindness to thousands, but also bring the punishment for the iniquity of parents upon their children and their descendants after them. O Great and Mighty God, whose name is the Lord of armies.’

(Jeremiah 32:19) 
‘Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought! Your eyes observe all the ways of the children of Adam, so that You may give to each one according to their ways and according to the fruit of their deeds.’

(Jeremiah 32:20) 
‘You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and have continued to do so, even to this day, both in Israel and among mankind. You have made a Name for Yourself, which is renowned to this very day.’

(Jeremiah 32:21) 
‘You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.’

(Jeremiah 32:22) 
‘You gave them this land, which You had sworn to their fathers to give them—a land flowing with milk and honey.’

(Jeremiah 32:23) 
‘They entered it and took possession, but they did not obey Your voice and did not walk in Your law. They did not do anything You commanded them to do, and so all these calamities have come upon them.’

(Jeremiah 32:24) 
‘See how the siege ramps are built right up to the city walls for its capture! The city has been handed over to the Chaldeans, who are fighting against it, through the sword, famine, and pestilence. Whatever You spoke has now come to pass, and You Yourself see it!’

(Jeremiah 32:25) 
‘Yet You, Sovereign Lord, God, said to me: “Buy the field with money and have witnesses,” even though the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’

(Jeremiah 32:26) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 32:27) 
‘Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all living beings. Is anything too difficult for Me?’

(Jeremiah 32:28) 
‘Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans and to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will capture it.’

(Jeremiah 32:29) 
‘The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come in and set it on fire. They will burn it down, along with the houses on whose rooftops they offered sacrifices to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke My anger.’

(Jeremiah 32:30) 
‘For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have continually done evil in My sight from their youth. Indeed, the children of Israel have provoked Me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the Lord.’

(Jeremiah 32:31) 
‘This city has been a constant provocation of My wrath and indignation from the day it was built until this very day, so that it must be removed from My sight.’

(Jeremiah 32:32) 
‘Because of all the evil that the children of Israel and the children of Judah committed—provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands with their wooden and stone idols.’

(Jeremiah 32:33) 
‘They turned their backs to Me, not their faces. Even though I taught them diligently, rising early and instructing them, they refused to listen to My discipline.’

(Jeremiah 32:34) 
‘They set up their detestable idols in the very House where My Name is invoked, to defile it.’

(Jeremiah 32:35) 
‘They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to consecrate their sons and daughters to Molech. I never commanded them to do such an abomination, nor did it ever enter My mind that they would lead Judah into such sin.’

(Jeremiah 32:36) 
‘And now, concerning all these things, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about this city, about which you yourselves are saying, “It will be handed over to the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and pestilence.”’

(Jeremiah 32:37) 
‘Behold, I will gather them from all the lands to which I have driven them in My furious anger, My indignation, and My great wrath. I will bring them back to this very place and make them dwell here securely.’

(Jeremiah 32:38) 
‘They will be My people, and I will be their God.’

(Jeremiah 32:39) 
‘I will give them one heart and one way of living, so that they may fear Me always. This will be for their own good and for the good of their children after them.’

(Jeremiah 32:40) 
‘I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them. And I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me.’

(Jeremiah 32:41) 
‘I will rejoice over them by doing good to them. I will plant them firmly in this land with all My heart and all My soul, truly and permanently.’

(Jeremiah 32:42) 
‘For this is what the Lord says: Just as I brought all this great disaster upon these people, so also will I bring upon them all the good that I promised them.’

(Jeremiah 32:43) 
‘Fields will again be bought and owned in this land, about which you are now saying, “It is desolate, without man or beast, and given into the hands of the Chaldeans.”’

(Jeremiah 32:44) 
‘Fields will be bought for money, deeds will be written, sealed, and signed by witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the areas around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the western foothills, and in the cities of the Negev. For I will restore their fortunes,’ declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:1) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still imprisoned in the court of the prison, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:2) 
Thus says the Lord, who will bring these things about, who will shape them, and who will establish them—the Lord is His name:

(Jeremiah 33:3) 
Call to Me, and I will hear you. I will declare to you great and unshakeable things, which you do not know.

(Jeremiah 33:4) 
For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been torn down to build up defenses against the siege towers and the ramparts of the enemy.

(Jeremiah 33:5) 
And concerning those who went out to fight against the Chaldeans: they will fill those houses with the corpses of the men whom I struck down in My wrath and in My indignation, because I hid My face from them on account of all their wickedness.

(Jeremiah 33:6) 
Behold, I will bring them healing and restoration, and I will cure them. I will reveal to them a lasting abundance of peace and truth.

(Jeremiah 33:7) 
I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as they were in the beginning.

(Jeremiah 33:8) 
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they sinned against Me. I will forgive all their iniquities by which they sinned against Me and spurned Me.

(Jeremiah 33:9) 
And Jerusalem will be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good things I do for them. They will be in awe and wonder at all the good things and all the peace that I bring to them.

(Jeremiah 33:10) 
Thus says the Lord: In this place, which you say is a desolate wilderness—where there is neither man nor beast—and in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem, and in its streets which are laid waste, without man, without inhabitant, and without beast, there will still be heard:

(Jeremiah 33:11) 
...the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying: 'Give praise to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for His mercy endures forever!' And the voice of those bringing offerings into the house of the Lord. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were in the beginning, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:12) 
Thus says the Lord of hosts: In this desolate place, where there is neither man nor beast, and in all its cities, there will again be a dwelling for shepherds, where flocks will lie down in peace.

(Jeremiah 33:13) 
And in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the plain, and in the cities toward the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one counting them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 33:14) 
Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up a righteous Branch for David. He will execute true judgment and justice in the land.

(Jeremiah 33:15) 
In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which they will call Him: 'The Lord is Our Righteousness.'

(Jeremiah 33:16) 
For thus says the Lord: A man from the line of David will never be lacking to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.

(Jeremiah 33:17) 
And from the priests and Levites, a man will never be lacking before Me who offers burnt offerings, burns grain offerings, and makes sacrifices every single day.

(Jeremiah 33:18) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:19) 
Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night can be broken, so that day and night do not come at their appointed time,

(Jeremiah 33:20) 
...then My covenant can also be broken with David My servant, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and likewise with the Levites, who are My priestly ministers.

(Jeremiah 33:21) 
...then just as the stars of the heavens cannot be counted, and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so also will I make the descendants of David My servant, and the Levites My ministers, countless in number.

(Jeremiah 33:22) 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 33:23) 
Have you not seen what this people has said, saying: 'The two families whom the Lord had chosen, Judah and Israel, have now been utterly cast off?' Thus, they have despised My people, considering them no longer a nation before them.

(Jeremiah 33:24) 
Thus says the Lord: If My covenant with day and night can be broken, and if the laws of the universe and the earth can be undone,

(Jeremiah 33:25) 
...then also My covenant will be broken with the descendants of Jacob and David My servant. Then I would no longer choose rulers from their descendants to preside over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Jeremiah 33:26) 
For just as the stars of the universe cannot be counted and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so also will I make the descendants of David My servant and the Levites My ministers countless in number.

(Jeremiah 34:1) 
This is the message that came from the Lord to Jeremiah at the time when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and all of his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his power, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying:

(Jeremiah 34:2) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Go and speak to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and tell him: This is what the Lord says: Behold, I will give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

(Jeremiah 34:3) 
And you will not escape from his hand, but you will be captured and handed over to him. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth will speak to your mouth, and you will go to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 34:4) 
Nevertheless, hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: This is what the Lord says to you: 'You will not die by the sword.'

(Jeremiah 34:5) 
You will die in peace. And just as they burned spices for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will perform the funeral burning ceremony for you. And they will mourn for you, saying, 'Alas, O king!' For I myself have spoken this word, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 34:6) 
And Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 34:7) 
And the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, against Lachish and against Azekah. For these were the only fortified cities of Judah that still remained.

(Jeremiah 34:8) 
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem,

(Jeremiah 34:9) 
that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, whether Hebrew men or Hebrew women, making them free. And that no one should keep them, that is, any Jew, in servitude.

(Jeremiah 34:10) 
So all the officials and all the people, who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant so they would no longer keep them in servitude, listened to it. And they obeyed and set them free.

(Jeremiah 34:11) 
But afterwards they turned back. And they took back their male and female servants whom they had set free, and they subjected them to be male and female slaves again.

(Jeremiah 34:12) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:

(Jeremiah 34:13) 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I made a covenant with your fathers on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying: '

(Jeremiah 34:14) 
'At the end of seven years, each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to him; and when he has served you for six years, you shall set him free from you.' But your fathers did not listen to Me, nor did they incline their ear to My commands.

(Jeremiah 34:15) 
And you yourselves turned today and did what was right in My eyes, by proclaiming liberty each man to his neighbor. And you made a covenant before Me in the Temple, in the house where My name is invoked.

(Jeremiah 34:16) 
But you turned back and profaned My name. And each of you took back his male servant and each his female servant, whom you had set free to be at liberty. And you subjected them, so that they became your male and female slaves again.

(Jeremiah 34:17) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'You have not listened to Me, to proclaim liberty each man to his brother and each man to his friend.' Behold, I proclaim liberty to you, says the Lord, a liberty to die by the sword, by pestilence, and by famine. And I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

(Jeremiah 34:18) 
And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant and have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut a calf in two and passed between its parts—this was a ritual for making solemn covenants—

(Jeremiah 34:19) 
I will give the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.

(Jeremiah 34:20) 
I will give them into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their lives. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth.

(Jeremiah 34:21) 
And Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his officials, I will give into the hands of their enemies and into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who had withdrawn from you.

(Jeremiah 34:22) 
Behold, I will command, says the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city of Jerusalem. And they will fight against it, and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, so that there will be no inhabitant.

(Jeremiah 35:1) 
This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord. It happened during the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah. The Lord's message stated:

(Jeremiah 35:2) 
"Go to the family of the Rechabites. Speak to them, and bring them into the Temple of the Lord, into one of its chambers. Then, offer them wine to drink."

(Jeremiah 35:3) 
So I, Jeremiah, brought Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, along with his brothers and all the members of the Rechabite family—their sons, their wives, and their entire company.

(Jeremiah 35:4) 
I led them into the Temple of the Lord. We went to the chamber belonging to the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located near the chamber of the princes, and it was above the chamber of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, who was the gatekeeper of the Temple.

(Jeremiah 35:5) 
Then I set before the Rechabite family, there in their chamber, many cups and goblets, all filled with wine. And I said to them, "Drink this wine."

(Jeremiah 35:6) 
They answered me, "We will not drink wine. Our ancestor, Jonadab, son of Rechab, commanded us, saying: 'You and your sons must never drink wine, not for all time.

(Jeremiah 35:7) 
You shall not build houses to live in. You shall not plant any crops. You shall not plant vineyards, nor possess any of your own. Instead, you must live in tents all your days. This way, you will live many days upon the face of the earth where you are dwelling as sojourners —people who live in a place but do not own land or settle permanently.'"

(Jeremiah 35:8) 
Therefore, we have obeyed and done everything that Jonadab, our ancestor, commanded us. We have not drunk wine throughout our entire lives—neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters.

(Jeremiah 35:9) 
We have not built houses to live in, and we have had no vineyard, no field, and no crops to plant.

(Jeremiah 35:10) 
We have always lived in tents, exactly as our ancestor Jonadab commanded us."

(Jeremiah 35:11) 
"However, when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up and invaded our land, we said, 'Come, let us go into Jerusalem to escape the army of the Chaldeans and the army of Syria.' That is why we are currently staying in Jerusalem."

(Jeremiah 35:12) 
Then the Lord's message came to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 35:13) 
This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not accept My instruction and listen to My words?' says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 35:14) 
The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons—that they should not drink wine—have been strong and effective. They have not drunk wine to this very day, and they have diligently kept the command of their ancestor. But I, the Lord, have spoken to you repeatedly, rising early and speaking diligently, yet you have not obeyed Me.

(Jeremiah 35:15) 
I sent all My servants, the prophets, to you, rising early and sending them persistently. I told them to say: 'Return, each one of you, from your wicked ways, and do good works. Do not follow foreign gods, nor worship them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers.' But you have not paid attention, nor have you listened to Me.

(Jeremiah 35:16) 
Because the sons of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have kept the command of their ancestor, which he gave them, but this people—the people of Judah—has not obeyed Me:

(Jeremiah 35:17) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity and disaster that I have spoken against them. This is because I spoke to them, but they did not listen; and I called to them, but they did not answer Me.'"

(Jeremiah 35:18) 
Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rechabites: "This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab, and have kept all his statutes, and have done everything he commanded you;

(Jeremiah 35:19) 
therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: "There shall never fail to be a man from the lineage of Jonadab, son of Rechab, who stands in My presence, serving Me, for all time.'"

(Jeremiah 36:1) 
This happened in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim, who was the son of Josiah and king of Judah. This word came from the Lord to Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:2) 
“Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations. Write everything I have said since I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, up until this very day.”

(Jeremiah 36:3) 
“Perhaps the entire house of Judah will listen to all the terrible things that I plan to do to them. If they do, each person might turn away from their wicked path. Then I will be merciful and forgive their evil deeds and their sins.”

(Jeremiah 36:4) 
So Jeremiah called Baruch, the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote down everything Jeremiah dictated from the mouth of the Lord—all the words the Lord had spoken to Jeremiah—onto a scroll.

(Jeremiah 36:5) 
Then Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:6) 
“I am confined and cannot go into the Lord’s Temple.”

(Jeremiah 36:7) 
“Therefore, you go in and read from the scroll. On it, you wrote down the words of the Lord at my dictation. Read it aloud to the people in the Lord’s Temple on a day of fasting. Also read it to all the people of Judah who come from their various towns.”

(Jeremiah 36:8) 
So Baruch, the son of Neriah, did everything that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. He read the words of the Lord from the scroll inside the Lord’s Temple.

(Jeremiah 36:9) 
It happened in the fifth year of King Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month. All the people in Jerusalem and the entire multitude from the towns of Judah who had gathered together in Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord.

(Jeremiah 36:10) 
And Baruch read Jeremiah’s words from the scroll in the Lord’s Temple, specifically in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe, which was in the upper court. All the people were listening.

(Jeremiah 36:11) 
Now Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord as they were read from the scroll.

(Jeremiah 36:12) 
Then Micaiah went down to the king’s palace, to the scribe’s chamber. There, all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

(Jeremiah 36:13) 
And Micaiah reported to them all the words that he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.

(Jeremiah 36:14) 
So all the officials sent Jehudi, the son of Neriah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying: “Take the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people and bring it with you. Come here.” So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the scroll in his hand and went to them.

(Jeremiah 36:15) 
And they said to him, “Sit down and read these words to us.” So Baruch read them aloud to them.

(Jeremiah 36:16) 
When they had heard all the words, they were astonished, each one looking at his neighbor. And they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”

(Jeremiah 36:17) 
And they questioned Baruch, saying, “Tell us, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”

(Jeremiah 36:18) 
And Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, as if reading them aloud, and I wrote them down on the scroll with ink.”

(Jeremiah 36:19) 
Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, both you and Jeremiah. No one should know where you are.”

(Jeremiah 36:20) 
They then went to the king in the courtyard. They reported all the words to the king, after placing the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe.

(Jeremiah 36:21) 
And the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. Jehudi took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it aloud, in the hearing of the king and all the officials who stood around the king.

(Jeremiah 36:22) 
The king was sitting in his winter palace in the ninth month. A fire was burning before him in the brazier.

(Jeremiah 36:23) 
After Jehudi had read just three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut the scroll with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier. He kept throwing pieces until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier.

(Jeremiah 36:24) 
Neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words showed any fear, nor did they tear their clothes in repentance, which was the custom when hearing a dire prophecy.

(Jeremiah 36:25) 
However, Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, but he did not listen to them.

(Jeremiah 36:26) 
Then the king commanded Jerahmeel, the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Lord hid them, protecting them from capture.

(Jeremiah 36:27) 
After the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah again, saying:

(Jeremiah 36:28) 
“Take another scroll again and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.”

(Jeremiah 36:29) 
“And to King Jehoiakim of Judah, you are to say: ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned this scroll, saying, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land, sweeping away both people and animals?”’”

(Jeremiah 36:30) 
“Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah: ‘He will have no successor to sit on the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out, exposed to the scorching heat by day and the freezing cold by night, without a proper burial.’”

(Jeremiah 36:31) 
“‘And I will punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their wickedness. I will bring upon them, upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the disaster that I have declared against them, because they did not listen.’”

(Jeremiah 36:32) 
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the scribe. And Baruch wrote on it, from Jeremiah’s dictation, all the words of the book that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire. In addition, many other similar words were added to it, emphasizing the severity of the prophecies.

(Jeremiah 37:37:1) 
King Zedekiah, Josiah's son, came to power, reigning in place of Jehoiachin, who was the son of Jehoiakim. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had appointed Zedekiah over the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 37:37:2) 
But Zedekiah himself, along with his officials and the common people of the land, did not listen to the messages from the Lord that He had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 37:37:3) 
King Zedekiah sent Jehucal, Shelemiah's son, and Zephaniah, Maaseiah's son who was a priest, to Jeremiah the prophet. The king asked them to say: “Please pray for us to the Lord our God.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:4) 
At this time, Jeremiah was still moving about freely among the people of Jerusalem, for the other prophets had already been imprisoned.

(Jeremiah 37:37:5) 
At that very moment, the Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt to provide aid to Judah. When the Chaldean forces, who were besieging Jerusalem, heard this news, they temporarily withdrew from Jerusalem to meet the Egyptian threat.

(Jeremiah 37:37:6) 
Then a specific message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

(Jeremiah 37:37:7) 
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Me: ‘Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which came out to help you, will return to its own land of Egypt.'

(Jeremiah 37:37:8) 
And then, after dealing with the Egyptians, the Chaldeans will return. They will fight against this city, capture it, and burn it down completely with fire.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:9) 
“This is what the Lord says: Do not deceive yourselves by thinking, ‘The Chaldeans will surely go away and withdraw from us permanently.’ I tell you, they will not withdraw permanently.

(Jeremiah 37:37:10) 
Even if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting against you, and only a few wounded men remained from them, each one of those men would still rise up from his tent and come to burn this city with fire. Their victory is inevitable.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:11) 
So, when the Chaldean army had indeed withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s advancing army,

(Jeremiah 37:37:12) 
Jeremiah decided to leave Jerusalem. His purpose was to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion of family land and settle a property dispute among his kinsmen.

(Jeremiah 37:37:13) 
But when Jeremiah arrived at the Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem, a guard was stationed there named Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. He seized Jeremiah the prophet and accused him, saying: “You are trying to desert to the Chaldeans!”

(Jeremiah 37:37:14) 
Jeremiah immediately responded, saying: “That is false! I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him. Instead, Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him before the leading officials of the city.

(Jeremiah 37:37:15) 
The officials were furious with Jeremiah. They ordered him to be beaten severely and then cast him into a prison that had been set up in the house of Jonathan the scribe, because Jonathan’s house had been converted into a temporary jail.

(Jeremiah 37:37:16) 
So Jeremiah was brought down into the cistern, which served as a dungeon, and into the cramped prison cells. Jeremiah remained there for many days.

(Jeremiah 37:37:17) 
However, King Zedekiah later sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the palace. He questioned him secretly in his own house, asking: “Is there any new message from the Lord?” Jeremiah answered straightforwardly: “There is!” And then Jeremiah added: “You will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:18) 
Jeremiah then said to King Zedekiah: “What wrong have I done to you, or to your officials, or to your people, that you have thrown me into this house of imprisonment?”

(Jeremiah 37:37:19) 
“Where are your own prophets who prophesied to you,” Jeremiah challenged, “the ones who kept saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?”

(Jeremiah 37:37:20) 
“Now therefore, please listen, my lord king,” Jeremiah pleaded. “Let my urgent appeal come before you, and please do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, for if I return there, I will surely die.”

(Jeremiah 37:37:21) 
So King Zedekiah gave a command that Jeremiah should be confined in the court of the guardhouse. He also ordered that Jeremiah be given a loaf of bread each day from the bakers’ street, and this continued until all the bread in the city was completely consumed. And so Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:1) 
Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying:

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:2) 
The Lord God says this: 'Whoever remains in this city will die by sword, by famine, and by plague. But whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live; his life will be spared as if by salvation, though he will be captured.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:3) 
The Lord God says this: 'This city will certainly be handed over into the power of the army of the King of Babylon, and they will capture it.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:4) 
Then the princes said to the king: 'We ask that this man be put to death. Because by saying words like these to them, he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and also the hands of all the people. For this man is not seeking the peace of these people, but their harm.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:5) 
And King Zedekiah said: 'Look, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing to oppose you.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:6) 
So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchiah, the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the prison. They let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now there was only mud in the cistern, not water, so Jeremiah sank into the mud.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:7) 
Now Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's household, heard that they had thrown Jeremiah into the cistern. (The king was then sitting at the Benjamin Gate).

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:8) 
So Ebedmelech left the king's household and spoke to the king, saying:

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:9) 
'My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, throwing him into the cistern so he might die there from hunger. For there is no more bread left in the city.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:10) 
Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying: 'Take thirty men from here with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:11) 
So Ebedmelech took the men with him. He went into the king's house, to the room beneath the treasury, and from there he took old rags and worn-out clothes. And he let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:12) 
Then Ebedmelech said to Jeremiah: 'Put these old rags, these worn-out and decayed clothes, under your armpits beneath the ropes.' And Jeremiah did so.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:13) 
So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and brought him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:14) 
King Zedekiah then sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to him at the third entrance, which was in the house of the Lord. And he said to Jeremiah: 'I am going to ask you a question. Do not hide anything from me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:15) 
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: 'If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:16) 
So King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying: 'As the Lord lives, who created our lives, I will neither put you to death nor hand you over to these men who are seeking your life.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:17) 
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah: 'The Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: If you go out and surrender to the princes of the King of Babylon, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burned with fire; and you and your household will live.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:18) 
'But if you do not go out and surrender to the princes of the King of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire. And you will not escape from their hand.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:19) 
And King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah: 'I am afraid of the Jewish citizens who have deserted to the Chaldeans; I am afraid that I might be handed over to them, and they would mock me.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:20) 
But Jeremiah said: 'They will not hand you over. Listen, I beg you, to the voice of the Lord that I am speaking to you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:21) 
'But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the Lord has shown me:'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:22) 
'Behold, all the women who are left in the house of the King of Judah will be led out to the princes of the King of Babylon. And they themselves will say: “Your trusted friends have deceived you and have overcome you! They have let your feet sink into the mud, and they have led you astray into a slippery place.”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:23) 
'All your wives and your children will be led out to the Chaldeans. And you yourself will not escape from their hands, but will be captured by the hands of the King of Babylon. And this city will be burned with fire.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:24) 
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah: 'Let no one know these words, and you will not die.'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:25) 
'But if the princes hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you: “Tell us what you said to the king, and do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:26) 
'Then you shall say to them: “I presented my plea before the king, asking him not to send me back to Jonathan's house, lest I die there.”'

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:27) 
So all the princes came to Jeremiah and questioned him; and he answered them according to all the words that the king had commanded him. So they ceased questioning him, for nothing had been heard about the actual conversation.

(Jeremiah 38:Jeremiah 38:28) 
So Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day Jerusalem was captured. And the word of the Lord came to him.

(Jeremiah 39:1) 
In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign as King of Judah, during the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, came with his entire army to Jerusalem and laid siege to the city.

(Jeremiah 39:2) 
Then, in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of that month, the city's defenses were breached.

(Jeremiah 39:3) 
All the princes of the King of Babylon entered the city and took their seats in the Middle Gate. These included Nergal-sharezer (the Samgar-nebo), Sarsechim (the Rab-saris), Nergal-sharezer (the Rab-mag), and all the other remaining princes of the King of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 39:4) 
But when King Zedekiah of Judah and all his fighting men saw them, they fled from the city by night. They went through the King’s Garden gate, which was between the two walls, and then escaped toward the desert road.

(Jeremiah 39:5) 
The Chaldean army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had seized him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, where the king pronounced judgment upon him.

(Jeremiah 39:6) 
The King of Babylon then executed Zedekiah's sons at Riblah, right before his very eyes. Nebuchadnezzar also killed all the nobles of Judah.

(Jeremiah 39:7) 
He also put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze chains so that he could be led away to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 39:8) 
The Chaldeans set the king's palace and the people's homes on fire. They also tore down the walls of Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 39:9) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away into exile in Babylon the rest of the people who had remained in the city, along with the deserters who had gone over to him, and all the remaining people.

(Jeremiah 39:10) 
But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, left some of the poorest people in the land of Judah, those who had absolutely nothing. On that same day, he gave them vineyards and cisterns for their use.

(Jeremiah 39:11) 
Now, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had given specific orders concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard. He had said:

(Jeremiah 39:12) 
"Take Jeremiah. Watch over him carefully and do not cause him any harm. Instead, treat him exactly as he wishes."

(Jeremiah 39:13) 
So Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, along with Nebushazban (the Rab-saris), and Nergal-sharezer (the Rab-mag), and all the chief officers of the King of Babylon, sent men.

(Jeremiah 39:14) 
They sent for Jeremiah and had him brought out of the court of the prison. Then they entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, so that he could be taken to his home and live among his own people.

(Jeremiah 39:15) 
While Jeremiah was still confined in the court of the prison, the word of the Lord had come to him, saying:

(Jeremiah 39:16) 
"Go and tell Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian: 'Thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I am bringing My words of judgment upon this city, for evil and not for good. They will be fulfilled before your very eyes on that day."'

(Jeremiah 39:17) 
"But I will rescue you on that day," declares the Lord, "and you will not be handed over to the men you fear."

(Jeremiah 39:18) 
"For I will certainly deliver you. You will not fall by the sword, but you will save your life because you trusted in Me," declares the Lord.

(Jeremiah 40:1) 
The word from the Lord came to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, released him from Ramah. Nebuzaradan had taken Jeremiah, bound in chains, from among all the people who were being exiled from Jerusalem and the land of Judea, as they were being led away to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 40:2) 
So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took Jeremiah aside and said to him: “The Lord your God has spoken this disaster against this land.”

(Jeremiah 40:3) 
He has brought it about. The Lord has done exactly as He said He would, because you sinned against the Lord and did not listen to His voice. Therefore, this word from God has come to pass upon you.

(Jeremiah 40:4) 
“Now, look, I am releasing you today from the chains that were on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will personally watch over you and care for you. But if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, then stay here. See, the whole land is before you; you may go wherever you please, and wherever you want to go, go there.”

(Jeremiah 40:5) 
When Jeremiah remained silent and gave no answer, Nebuzaradan spoke again: “Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed as governor over the cities of Judah. You can live with him among the remaining people there, or you can go anywhere else that pleases you.” The captain of the guard also gave Jeremiah provisions and a gift, and then he let him go.

(Jeremiah 40:6) 
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, in Mizpah. He lived with Gedaliah among the people who were still left in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 40:7) 
Now, all the commanders of the armies who had been scattered throughout the surrounding regions—they, along with their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, as governor over the land. The king had entrusted to him the care of the men, women, and children, and the poorest of the land, who had not been taken into exile in Babylon.

(Jeremiah 40:8) 
So these men came to Gedaliah in Mizpah, along with their soldiers: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, the sons of Kareah; Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai; and Jezaniah, the son of Maacah.

(Jeremiah 40:9) 
Then Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, made an oath to them and their men, saying: “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land, serve the king of Babylon, and things will go well for you.”

(Jeremiah 40:10) 
“Look, I myself will reside in Mizpah to stand before the Chaldeans who come to us and to carry out their commands. As for you, go and gather your wine harvest, your grain harvest, and your olive oil. Store these provisions in your vessels, and then settle in the cities you have taken possession of.”

(Jeremiah 40:11) 
And all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and in all the other surrounding regions—when they heard that the king of Babylon had allowed a remnant of the Jewish people to remain in the land of Judah, and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them—

(Jeremiah 40:12) 
—all these Jewish people returned from all the places to which they had fled. They came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah in Mizpah, and they gathered a very abundant harvest of wine, grain, and olive oil.

(Jeremiah 40:13) 
Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who had been scattered in the surrounding regions, came to Gedaliah in Mizpah.

(Jeremiah 40:14) 
And they said to him: “Do you not know that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, to murder you?” But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, did not believe what they told him.

(Jeremiah 40:15) 
Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, spoke to Gedaliah privately in Mizpah, saying: “I will go and kill Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, without anyone else knowing about it. This is so he cannot murder you, which would cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to be scattered again, and the entire remnant of Judah to perish.”

(Jeremiah 40:16) 
But Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, said to Johanan, the son of Kareah: “You must not do this thing, for you are speaking a lie about Ishmael.”

(Jeremiah 41:41:1) 
It happened in the seventh month: Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was of royal lineage, came to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, in Mizpah. With Ishmael were officers of the king and ten other men. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah.

(Jeremiah 41:41:2) 
Then Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, stood up. They struck Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with a sword and killed him. Gedaliah was the one whom the King of Babylon had appointed over the land.

(Jeremiah 41:41:3) 
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah in Mizpah. He also killed the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.

(Jeremiah 41:41:4) 
On the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and before anyone else knew about it,

(Jeremiah 41:41:5) 
eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. Their beards were shaved, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, as a sign of mourning. They were carrying grain offerings and incense to present at the House of the Lord.

(Jeremiah 41:41:6) 
Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah to meet them, pretending to weep as he walked. When he met them, he deceptively said to them, 'Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.'

(Jeremiah 41:41:7) 
When they had come into the middle of the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him, slaughtered them in the middle of the city. Then he threw their bodies into a pit.

(Jeremiah 41:41:8) 
However, ten of those men were found among them. They pleaded with Ishmael, 'Do not kill us! We have hidden stores of barley, wheat, oil, and honey in the fields.' So Ishmael stopped, and he did not kill them along with their companions.

(Jeremiah 41:41:9) 
The pit into which Ishmael threw all the bodies of the men he had killed, in connection with Gedaliah's murder, was the large cistern that King Asa had made long ago, because of King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled it with the slain.

(Jeremiah 41:41:10) 
Ishmael then captured all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah: the king's daughters and everyone else who remained in Mizpah. These were the people whom Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, had entrusted to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, took them and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.

(Jeremiah 41:41:11) 
However, Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, heard about all the evil deeds that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had committed.

(Jeremiah 41:41:12) 
So, gathering all their men, they went to fight against Ishmael, son of Nethaniah. They found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.

(Jeremiah 41:41:13) 
When all the people who had been taken by Ishmael saw Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, they rejoiced greatly.

(Jeremiah 41:41:14) 
All the people whom Ishmael had captured in Mizpah turned around. They returned and went over to Johanan, son of Kareah.

(Jeremiah 41:41:15) 
But Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, escaped with eight of his men from Johanan, son of Kareah, and fled to the Ammonites.

(Jeremiah 41:41:16) 
So Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the army commanders who were with him, gathered together all the remnant of the people whom Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, had taken from Mizpah, after he had murdered Gedaliah, son of Ahikam. These were the strong men of war, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.

(Jeremiah 41:41:17) 
They then set out and settled in Geruth Kimham, which is near Bethlehem. Their plan was to flee and go into Egypt.

(Jeremiah 41:41:18) 
They did this because they feared the Chaldeans. They were afraid of retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, whom the King of Babylon had appointed over the land of Judah, by Ishmael, son of Nethaniah.

(Jeremiah 42:1) 
Then all the commanders of the army, including Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, came near with all the people, from the least important to the greatest.

(Jeremiah 42:2) 
And they said to Jeremiah the prophet: 'Let our prayer be heard before you, and pray for us to God Our Lord. Pray for all of this small remnant of people. We have been left behind—only a few of us from the many—just as you yourself can see with your own eyes.'

(Jeremiah 42:3) 
'And let God Our Lord reveal to us the way in which we ought to go, and the message we should follow.'

(Jeremiah 42:4) 
Jeremiah the prophet said to them: 'I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to God Our Lord on your behalf, according to your words. And every single message that He answers me with, I will tell you. I will not hide anything from you.'

(Jeremiah 42:5) 
And they themselves said to Jeremiah: 'May Our Lord be a true and faithful witness between us. We swear that we will do exactly according to every message that God Our Lord sends you to us with.'

(Jeremiah 42:6) 
'Whether the message is good or bad, we will obey the voice of God Our Lord, to Whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of God Our Lord.'

(Jeremiah 42:7) 
Then, after ten days, the message from Our Lord came to Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 42:8) 
So Jeremiah called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the army who were with him, and all the people, from the least important to the greatest.

(Jeremiah 42:9) 
And he said to them: 'Thus says God Our Lord, the God of Israel, to Whom you sent me to present your prayers before Him...'

(Jeremiah 42:10) 
'If you remain settled in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down. I will plant you and not pluck you up. For I have now relented from the disaster that I brought upon you.'

(Jeremiah 42:11) 
'Do not fear the king of Babylon, whom you are terrified of. Do not be afraid of him, declares Our Lord. For I am with you to save you and to rescue you from his power.'

(Jeremiah 42:12) 
'And I will show you mercy; I will have compassion on you. I will bring you back to your own land.'

(Jeremiah 42:13) 
'But if you say: 'We do not want to remain in this land,' and if you do not listen to the voice of God Our Lord...'

(Jeremiah 42:14) 
'...saying: 'No, not at all! Instead, we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will not see war, and we will not hear the sound of the trumpet, and we will not suffer from famine!' —and so you intend to live there...'

(Jeremiah 42:15) 
'Because of this, now hear the message of Our Lord, you remnant of Judah! Thus says Our Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: 'If you stubbornly set your faces toward entering Egypt, and if you indeed go there to live...'

(Jeremiah 42:16) 
'...then the very sword that you dread will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. And the famine that you fear will cling to you there in Egypt. And there you will die.'

(Jeremiah 42:17) 
'And all the men who stubbornly set their faces toward entering Egypt to live there will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague. Not one of them will survive or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.'

(Jeremiah 42:18) 
'For thus says Our Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Just as My wrath and My indignation poured out over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My indignation pour out over you if you enter Egypt. You will become an object of cursing, astonishment, malediction, and disgrace, and you will never again see this place.'

(Jeremiah 42:19) 
'Our Lord has spoken this message over you, O remnant of Judah: Do not go into Egypt! Know this for certain, because I have solemnly warned you today.'

(Jeremiah 42:20) 
'For you acted deceptively with your own souls when you said: 'Let us pray to God Our Lord for us. According to everything that God Our Lord tells us, so we will do.' And yet now you have acted deceptively with your own souls.'

(Jeremiah 42:21) 
'And you sent me to God Our Lord, saying: 'Pray for us to God Our Lord, and according to everything that God Our Lord tells you, so announce it to us.''

(Jeremiah 42:22) 
'Therefore, know this for certain now: you will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague in the very place where you desired to go and live.'

(Jeremiah 43:1) 
And so it happened, when Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people every single word of the Lord their God—those words for which the Lord their God had sent him on a mission to them—all these very words:

(Jeremiah 43:2) 
Then Azariah, the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men spoke, saying to Jeremiah: "You are speaking a lie! The Lord our God has not sent you on a mission, saying: 'Do not go to Egypt to live there.'"

(Jeremiah 43:3) 
"Instead, Baruch, the son of Neriah, is inciting you against us, so that you may hand us over into the power of the Chaldeans, to kill us and to carry us away to Babylon."

(Jeremiah 43:4) 
So Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the soldiers, and all the people, did not listen to the voice of the Lord, so that they might remain in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 43:5) 
Instead, Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the soldiers, took all the remaining people of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been exiled, so that they might live in the land of Judah.

(Jeremiah 43:6) 
They took the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every living person whom Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, had left behind with Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. And they also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch, the son of Neriah.

(Jeremiah 43:7) 
And so they entered the land of Egypt because they had not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and they came all the way to Tahpanhes.

(Jeremiah 43:8) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying:

(Jeremiah 43:9) 
"Take large stones in your hand and bury them in the hidden place that is under the brick pavement at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, with the men of Judah watching."

(Jeremiah 43:10) 
"And you are to say to them: 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I myself am sending for and bringing Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant. And I will set his throne upon these very stones which you have hidden, and he will pitch his royal tent over them."'

(Jeremiah 43:11) 
"And when he comes, he will strike the land of Egypt. Those destined for death will face death; those destined for captivity will go into captivity; and those destined for the sword will die by the sword."

(Jeremiah 43:12) 
"And he will set fire to the houses of the gods of Egypt; he will burn them and lead their idols into captivity. He will strip the land of Egypt clean, just as a shepherd thoroughly cleans his garment of clinging dirt or parasites. Then he will depart from there in peace."

(Jeremiah 43:13) 
"And he will break to pieces the sacred pillars of Heliopolis, which are in the land of Egypt, and he will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire."

(Jeremiah 44:44:1) 
This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt. These were the Jews dwelling in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the region of Pathros. The message stated:

(Jeremiah 44:44:2) 
This is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'You yourselves have seen all the disasters I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, they are desolate ruins today, and no one lives in them anymore.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:3) 
This happened because of the evil deeds they committed, which provoked Me to anger. They did this by going and offering incense to other gods and worshipping them—false gods that neither they, nor you, nor your fathers had ever known.

(Jeremiah 44:44:4) 
Even so, I sent all My servants the prophets to you, again and again, rising early and sending them. I told them to say: 'Do not do this detestable kind of thing that I hate.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:5) 
But they did not listen, nor did they pay any attention. They refused to turn from their evil ways and stop offering incense to other gods.

(Jeremiah 44:44:6) 
So My indignation and My fury were poured out, and they burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. These places became a desolate ruin and a waste, just as you see them this very day.

(Jeremiah 44:44:7) 
Now, therefore, this is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Why are you doing this great evil against your own lives? You are causing men and women, infants and nursing babies to perish from among you in Judah, ensuring that no remnant remains for you.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:8) 
You provoke Me to anger with the works of your own hands by offering sacrifices to false gods in the land of Egypt, where you have come to live as foreigners. By doing this, you ensure your own destruction, making yourselves a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth.

(Jeremiah 44:44:9) 
Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives? Have you forgotten your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they all committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

(Jeremiah 44:44:10) 
They have not humbled themselves or been cleansed of their sins even to this very day. They have not feared Me, nor have they walked in My law and in My commandments, which I gave to you and to your fathers.

(Jeremiah 44:44:11) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Behold, I am setting My face against you with resolve to bring disaster and to destroy all Judah.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:12) 
I will take the remnant of Judah who stubbornly set their minds on going into the land of Egypt to live there as foreigners. They will all perish in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and by famine. From the least important to the most important, they will die by sword and famine. They will become a curse, an object of horror, a malediction, and a reproach.

(Jeremiah 44:44:13) 
I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, with the sword, famine, and pestilence.

(Jeremiah 44:44:14) 
There will be no one who escapes and survives from the remnant of Judah who go into the land of Egypt to live there as foreigners. They will not return to the land of Judah, which they desire with all their souls to inhabit. No, they will not return, except for a very few who manage to flee in haste.

(Jeremiah 44:44:15) 
Then all the men who knew that their wives were regularly offering sacrifices to false gods, along with their wives, and all the large crowd of Jews from the land of Judah who were living in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying:

(Jeremiah 44:44:16) 
'The message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord—we will not listen to it from you!'

(Jeremiah 44:44:17) 
'No, we will certainly do everything we have vowed to do, which comes out of our own mouths. We will continue to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven—that pagan goddess—and pour out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. When we did this, we were filled with bread, and it was well with us; we experienced no misfortune.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:18) 
'But ever since we stopped offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and we have been consumed by the sword and by famine.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:19) 
'And when we women offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, do you think we make cakes in her image for her worship and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands knowing about it and consenting?' This implies a rhetorical 'No, we do it with their full knowledge and consent.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:20) 
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people, to all the men and all the women who had answered him with those words, saying:

(Jeremiah 44:44:21) 
'The sacrifices you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land—did the Lord not remember these things? Did these actions not come into His mind?'

(Jeremiah 44:44:22) 
'And the Lord could no longer tolerate it, because of the wickedness of your deeds and because of the detestable things you committed. Therefore, your land became a desolation, a place of horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant, just as you see it this very day.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:23) 
'Because you offered incense and sinned against the Lord, and you did not obey the voice of the Lord, and you did not walk in His law, in His commandments, and in His testimonies, these disasters have come upon you, just as you see them this very day.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:24) 
Jeremiah then said to all the people and to all the women: 'Hear the message of the Lord, all of you from Judah who are in the land of Egypt!'

(Jeremiah 44:44:25) 
'This is what the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel, says: "You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and carried out with your hands, saying: 'We will certainly perform our vows which we made, to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.' You have indeed confirmed your vows and have fulfilled them with your actions."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:26) 
'Therefore, hear the message of the Lord, all of you from Judah who live in the land of Egypt: "Behold, I have sworn by My great name," says the Lord, "that My name will no longer be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, no one saying: 'As the Lord God lives!' This means their claim to follow Me will cease."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:27) 
'"Behold, I will watch over them for evil and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by famine until they are utterly destroyed and perish."'

(Jeremiah 44:44:28) 
'And only a very few who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah. Then all the remnant of Judah who entered the land of Egypt to live as foreigners there will know whose word stands firm: My word, or their word.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:29) 
'And this will be a sign to you,' says the Lord, 'that I will punish you in this very place, so that you may know that My words will truly be established against you to bring disaster.'

(Jeremiah 44:44:30) 
'This is what the Lord says: "Behold, I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I handed over Zedekiah, the king of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon—his enemy and one who sought his life."'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:1) 
This is the message that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch, son of Neriah. This happened when Baruch was writing these words from Jeremiah's own dictation into a scroll, during the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, as king of Judah. Jeremiah delivered the message to Baruch, saying:

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:2) 
The Lord God of Israel says this to you, Baruch:

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:3) 
You said, 'Alas for me, I am miserable! The Lord has added more sorrow to my existing pain. I am exhausted from my constant groaning, and I cannot find any peace or rest.'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:4) 
Then Jeremiah will say this to him: The Lord declares, 'Listen! What I have built up, I am now going to tear down. What I have planted, I am now going to uproot. This will happen throughout all the land.'

(Jeremiah 45:Jeremias 45:5) 
And are you seeking great things and personal honors for yourself? Stop seeking them! For behold, the Lord declares, 'I am about to bring disaster upon all of humanity. But I will allow you to keep your life as a spoil of war, and you will be safe wherever you go.'

(Jeremiah 46:1) 
This is the word of the Lord, which came to Jeremiah the prophet, and it was a message against the nations.

(Jeremiah 46:2) 
It was a message concerning Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt. This army was stationed by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, where Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, defeated them. This battle happened in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.

(Jeremiah 46:3) 
To the Egyptian army, God says: Prepare your large shield and your small buckler, and go forth to war!

(Jeremiah 46:4) 
Harness your horses, O horsemen, and mount them! Stand ready with your helmets, fitted securely, and sharpen your spears. Put on your breastplates, O warriors!

(Jeremiah 46:5) 
But what is this that I see? I see them utterly terrified, turning their backs and fleeing! Their mighty warriors are cut down and have turned to run away. They have not returned because fear has gripped them from every side, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 46:6) 
The swift soldier will not escape, and the strong warrior will not be saved. By the Euphrates River, in the northern lands, they have stumbled and fallen down completely.

(Jeremiah 46:7) 
Who is this that rises up like the Nile River, and whose waters surge like powerful torrents?

(Jeremiah 46:8) 
It is Egypt, rising up like the Nile, and its waters will surge like torrents. Egypt says: 'I will rise up and cover the whole land! I will destroy its cities and all their inhabitants!'

(Jeremiah 46:9) 
Mount your horses, and rejoice in your chariots, O mighty warriors! Go forth, Ethiopians and Libyans, holding your shields! And you, Lydians, hold and direct your arrows!

(Jeremiah 46:10) 
But that day is the day of the Lord, the God of the heavenly armies—a day of vengeance, when He will take retribution on His enemies. The sword will devour until it is completely satisfied, and it will be drunk with their blood. For this is a sacrifice to the Lord, the God of heavenly armies, in the northern land, by the Euphrates River.

(Jeremiah 46:11) 
Go up to Gilead and gather healing balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! You multiply your medicines in vain; there will be no healing for you from this wound.

(Jeremiah 46:12) 
The nations have heard of your shame and disgrace, and your wailing has filled the whole earth. For a mighty warrior has stumbled against another mighty warrior, and both of them have fallen together.

(Jeremiah 46:13) 
This is the word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and his coming to strike the land of Egypt.

(Jeremiah 46:14) 
Announce it in Egypt! Make it heard in Migdol! Let it resound in Memphis and Tahpanhes! Say to them: 'Stand ready and prepare yourselves, for the sword will devour all around you!'

(Jeremiah 46:15) 
Why has your mighty protector fallen? He did not stand, because the Lord Himself overthrew him.

(Jeremiah 46:16) 
Many have fallen, and one man has fallen upon his neighbor. They will say: 'Arise, let us return to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the face of the sword of the oppressor from the north.'

(Jeremiah 46:17) 
Call the name of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: 'A mere boast at its appointed time,' or 'A great noise that quickly passes.'

(Jeremiah 46:18) 
'As I live,' says the King, whose name is the Lord of heavenly armies, 'for as Tabor stands majestic among the mountains, and as Carmel rises by the sea, so surely will he come!'

(Jeremiah 46:19) 
Prepare for yourselves your traveling bags for exile, O dwelling daughter of Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolate wasteland, laid waste and completely uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 46:20) 
Egypt is like a most beautiful heifer, but a stinging gadfly, a deadly attack, will come to her from the north.

(Jeremiah 46:21) 
Even her hired soldiers, who were among her like well-fed calves, have turned and fled together; they could not stand their ground. For the day of their slaughter has come upon them, the very time of their divine punishment.

(Jeremiah 46:22) 
Her voice will sound like the hiss of a serpent fleeing, because the enemy will march with an army and come against her with axes, like those who cut down trees in a forest.

(Jeremiah 46:23) 
They have cut down her forest, says the Lord, a forest that cannot be replenished. For the invaders are more numerous than locusts, and there is no numbering them.

(Jeremiah 46:24) 
The daughter of Egypt is utterly put to shame; she is delivered into the hand of the people from the north.

(Jeremiah 46:25) 
Thus says the Lord of heavenly armies, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I am about to punish the mighty pride of Alexandria, and Pharaoh, and Egypt itself, and her gods, and her kings — even Pharaoh and all those who trust in him.'

(Jeremiah 46:26) 
And I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. But after these things, Egypt shall be inhabited again, as in the days of old, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 46:27) 
But as for you, My servant Jacob, do not fear, and do not be terrified, O Israel! For behold, I will save you from distant lands, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return and rest and be at peace, and no one shall make him afraid.

(Jeremiah 46:28) 
Therefore, do not fear, O My servant Jacob, says the Lord, for I am with you. For I will utterly destroy all the nations among whom I have scattered you, but I will not utterly destroy you. Instead, I will discipline you with justice, and I will by no means let you go unpunished as if you were innocent.

(Jeremiah 47:1) 
The word of the Lord, which came to Jeremiah the prophet, was a prophecy concerning the Philistines. This prophecy came before Pharaoh attacked the city of Gaza.

(Jeremiah 47:2) 
The Lord declares: "Behold, a great flood of devastation is rising from the north, like an overflowing torrent. It will cover the land and all its inhabitants—the cities and everyone living in them. People will cry out in terror, and all the inhabitants of that land will wail."

(Jeremiah 47:3) 
At the terrifying sound of crashing weapons and the shouts of warring princes, at the loud rumbling of chariot wheels and the furious charge of war chariots, fathers will be too paralyzed by fear and despair to even reach out to save their children. Their hands will be too weak from terror to act.

(Jeremiah 47:4) 
This devastation comes because a destroyer will come against all the Philistines, intending to destroy the cities of Tyre and Sidon, along with all their allied forces. For the Lord will completely annihilate the Philistines, those remaining descendants from the island of Caphtor.

(Jeremiah 47:5) 
Gaza has been stripped bare in mourning and desolation. Ashkelon is utterly silent, and the remaining inhabitants of their coastal plain are likewise silent. The prophet cries out, "How long will you continue to destroy, O razor of the Lord?"

(Jeremiah 47:6) 
"O razor of the Lord, how long will you keep destroying? When will you finally rest? Sheathe yourself! Be still, and be silent!"

(Jeremiah 47:7) 
"How can it possibly rest when the Lord Himself has given it a command? He has directed it against Ashkelon and against all the Philistine coastal regions, and there He has appointed its destructive work."

(Jeremiah 48:1) 
The Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says this concerning Moab: Woe to Nebo, for it is laid waste and put to shame! Kiriathaim has been captured; her stronghold is disgraced and has trembled.

(Jeremiah 48:2) 
There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Heshbon. An evil plan has been devised: “Come, let us destroy Moab from being a nation.” Therefore, you will be silenced and pursued by the sword.

(Jeremiah 48:3) 
A voice of crying is heard from Horonaim, a great devastation and destruction.

(Jeremiah 48:4) 
Moab has been crushed. Proclaim her fate to her little ones.

(Jeremiah 48:5) 
With bitter weeping, they ascend the road to Luhith. For on the descent to Horonaim, the enemies have raised a cry of destruction.

(Jeremiah 48:6) 
Flee, save your lives, and you will be like a desert bush in the wilderness.

(Jeremiah 48:7) 
Because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you also will be captured. Chemosh (the god of Moab) will go into exile, along with his priests and his princes.

(Jeremiah 48:8) 
A destroyer will come to every city, and no city will be saved. The valleys will perish, and the plains will be laid waste, for the Lord has spoken it.

(Jeremiah 48:9) 
Give wings to Moab, that she may flee swiftly. Her cities will become desolate and uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 48:10) 
Cursed is he who does the Lord's work deceitfully. And cursed is he who keeps his sword from shedding blood.

(Jeremiah 48:11) 
Moab has been at ease from her youth, resting on her dregs like wine undisturbed. She has not been poured from vessel to vessel, nor has she gone into exile. Therefore, her taste remains in her, and her scent has not changed.

(Jeremiah 48:12) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send men to Moab to tip her over and empty her out. They will empty her vessels and smash her jars.

(Jeremiah 48:13) 
Moab will be put to shame by Chemosh (her god), just as the house of Israel was put to shame by Bethel, their false god in whom they trusted.

(Jeremiah 48:14) 
How can you say, “We are mighty, strong men for battle”?

(Jeremiah 48:15) 
Moab is laid waste, and her cities are attacked. Her chosen young men are slaughtered, says the King, whose name is the Lord of Armies.

(Jeremiah 48:16) 
The destruction of Moab is near, and her calamity hastens swiftly.

(Jeremiah 48:17) 
All who surround Moab, and all who know her name, mourn for her. Say, “How has the strong staff, the glorious scepter, been broken?”

(Jeremiah 48:18) 
Descend from your glory and sit in the dust, Daughter of Dibon. For the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has torn down your strongholds.

(Jeremiah 48:19) 
Stand by the road and look, inhabitant of Aroer. Ask the fleeing one and the one who has escaped, saying, “What has happened?”

(Jeremiah 48:20) 
Moab is disgraced, for she is overcome. Wail and cry out! Proclaim by the Arnon River that Moab is laid waste.

(Jeremiah 48:21) 
And judgment has come upon the land of the plain: upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,

(Jeremiah 48:22) 
And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-Diblathaim,

(Jeremiah 48:23) 
And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-Gamul, and upon Beth-Meon,

(Jeremiah 48:24) 
And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.

(Jeremiah 48:25) 
The horn (symbol of strength) of Moab is cut off, and her arm is broken, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:26) 
Make Moab drunk, for she has defied the Lord. Moab will wallow in her own vomit and become a laughingstock.

(Jeremiah 48:27) 
Was not Israel a laughingstock to you, as if you had found him among thieves? Therefore, because of the words you spoke against him, you will be taken captive.

(Jeremiah 48:28) 
Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, inhabitants of Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest in the highest cleft of a rock.

(Jeremiah 48:29) 
We have heard of Moab's great pride; she is exceedingly proud: her loftiness, her arrogance, her pride, and the haughtiness of her heart.

(Jeremiah 48:30) 
I know her boasting, says the Lord, but her power is not equal to her boast, nor can she accomplish what she claims.

(Jeremiah 48:31) 
Therefore, I will wail over Moab; I will cry out for all of Moab. I will mourn for the men of Kir-Heres (the strong city of Moab).

(Jeremiah 48:32) 
I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah, with the weeping of Jazer. Your branches spread beyond the sea, reaching even to the Sea of Jazer. But a destroyer has fallen upon your harvest and your vintage.

(Jeremiah 48:33) 
Joy and gladness have been taken away from the fruitful fields and from the land of Moab. I have removed wine from the winepresses. No one will tread the grapes and sing the treader's song.

(Jeremiah 48:34) 
From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh and Jahaz, they have raised their voices. From Zoar to Horonaim, they cry like a three-year-old heifer. The waters of Nimrim also will be desolate.

(Jeremiah 48:35) 
And I will put an end to Moab, says the Lord, to anyone who offers sacrifices on the high places and burns incense to her idols.

(Jeremiah 48:36) 
Therefore, my heart will lament for Moab like a flute, and my heart will lament for the men of Kir-Heres like a flute. For the wealth she acquired has perished, even more than she possessed.

(Jeremiah 48:37) 
For every head will be shaved bald, and every beard cut off. On all hands will be gashes, and on every back, sackcloth. These are traditional signs of deep mourning.

(Jeremiah 48:38) 
On all the rooftops of Moab and in her public squares, there will be universal lamentation. For I have crushed Moab like a useless vessel, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:39) 
How she is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned her back in shame! Moab will be an object of scorn and a warning to all around her.

(Jeremiah 48:40) 
Thus says the Lord: Behold, an enemy will swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings over Moab.

(Jeremiah 48:41) 
Kerioth is captured, and the strongholds are taken. The hearts of Moab's warriors on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 48:42) 
And Moab will be destroyed from being a nation, because she defied the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:43) 
Terror, a pit, and a snare are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:44) 
Whoever flees from the terror will fall into the pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare. For I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 48:45) 
Those who fled stood helpless in the shadow of Heshbon, because they had no more strength. For fire will come out from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon. It will devour the border regions of Moab and the heads of the boastful people.

(Jeremiah 48:46) 
Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh. For your sons and your daughters have been taken captive.

(Jeremiah 48:47) 
Yet, in the latter days, I will restore the fortunes of Moab, says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment upon Moab.

(Jeremiah 49:1) 
To the descendants of Ammon. This is what the Lord says: Does Israel not have sons? Does Israel not have an heir? If so, why has the false god Milcom, or the king of Ammon, taken possession of the tribe of Gad's land? And why do his people dwell in its cities?

(Jeremiah 49:2) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will cause the sound of battle to be heard against Rabbah, the capital city of the descendants of Ammon. It will become a desolate mound of rubble, and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will truly possess what is its inheritance, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:3) 
Cry out, O Heshbon, for the city of Ai is devastated! Wail, O villages of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth, mourn, and wander through the ruins, for Milcom—your false god and king—will be taken into exile, along with his priests and his princes.

(Jeremiah 49:4) 
Why do you boast about your valleys? Your valley is ruined, O pampered daughter of Ammon! You trusted in your treasures and said, 'Who will attack me?'

(Jeremiah 49:5) 
Behold, I am bringing terror upon you from all those around you, says the Lord, the God of heavenly armies! I will scatter you in all directions, and there will be no one to gather the fleeing survivors.

(Jeremiah 49:6) 
But after these things, I will restore the fortunes of the descendants of Ammon, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:7) 
Concerning Edom. This is what the Lord of heavenly armies says: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman, a place known for its wise men? Has counsel perished from the sons of Esau? Has their wisdom become useless?

(Jeremiah 49:8) 
Flee, turn back, retreat into the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan, an allied nation! For I will bring the destruction of Esau's descendants (Edom) upon him, the time of his punishment.

(Jeremiah 49:9) 
If grape gatherers came to you, wouldn't they leave some gleanings behind? If thieves came by night, they would only steal enough for themselves.

(Jeremiah 49:10) 
But I myself will strip Esau (Edom) bare; I will uncover his hidden places, and he will not be able to hide. Edom is devastated, along with his children, his relatives, and his neighbors; there will be no one left.

(Jeremiah 49:11) 
O Edom, leave your orphans to Me; I will preserve their lives. And your widows will hope in Me, even amidst your destruction.

(Jeremiah 49:12) 
For this is what the Lord says: Behold, those who were not condemned to drink the cup of My wrath will certainly drink it. So then, will you, who are far from innocent, be left unpunished? No, you will not be left; you will surely drink the cup of My judgment.

(Jeremiah 49:13) 
For I have sworn by Myself, says the Lord, that Bozrah, Edom's capital city, will become a desolate ruin, an object of reproach, a wasteland, and a curse. And all its cities will become everlasting desolations.

(Jeremiah 49:14) 
I have heard a report from the Lord, and an envoy has been sent among the nations: 'Gather yourselves, and come against Edom! Let us rise up for battle!'

(Jeremiah 49:15) 
For behold, I have made you small among the nations, despised among men.

(Jeremiah 49:16) 
Your arrogance has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, you who dwell in the clefts of the rocks, like the city of Petra, trying to seize the heights of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as the eagle's, from there I will bring you down, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:17) 
And Edom will become a desolation; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss in astonishment at its wounds.

(Jeremiah 49:18) 
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities were overthrown, says the Lord, no one will live there, and no human being will dwell in it.

(Jeremiah 49:19) 
Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan River against the strong pastures. For I will suddenly make him rush upon it. And the one whom I choose, him I will appoint over it. For who is like Me? And who will challenge Me? And what shepherd can stand before My face?

(Jeremiah 49:20) 
Therefore, hear the plan of the Lord that He has formed concerning Edom, and His intentions that He has devised concerning the inhabitants of Teman: Surely, the weakest of the flock will drag them away. Surely, their dwellings will be devastated along with them.

(Jeremiah 49:21) 
At the sound of their fall, the earth will tremble. The cry of their destruction will be heard as far as the Red Sea.

(Jeremiah 49:22) 
Behold, he will ascend like an eagle and fly swiftly, spreading his wings over Bozrah. And on that day, the hearts of Edom's bravest warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 49:23) 
Concerning Damascus. Hamath and Arphad are shamed and dismayed, for they have heard terrible news. They are troubled like the restless sea; they cannot be at peace.

(Jeremiah 49:24) 
Damascus is weakened; she has turned to flee. Terror has seized her, and anguish and pains have overcome her, like a woman in labor.

(Jeremiah 49:25) 
How is it that such a praiseworthy city, the city of My joy, has been abandoned?

(Jeremiah 49:26) 
Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of battle will be silenced on that day, says the Lord of heavenly armies.

(Jeremiah 49:27) 
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad, a royal title for the kings of Aram-Damascus.

(Jeremiah 49:28) 
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, attacked. This is what the Lord says: 'Rise up, go up against Kedar, and lay waste to the people of the East, the desert tribes.'

(Jeremiah 49:29) 
Their tents and their flocks will be captured; their tent coverings, all their vessels, and their camels will be taken away. Terror will be proclaimed against them from every side.

(Jeremiah 49:30) 
Flee, depart quickly, retreat into the depths, O inhabitants of Hazor, says the Lord! For Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has formed a plan against you, and has devised intentions concerning you.

(Jeremiah 49:31) 
Rise up, and go up against a nation that lives peacefully and securely, says the Lord. They have no gates nor bars; they dwell alone without defenses.

(Jeremiah 49:32) 
Their camels will become plunder, and their great number of livestock will be spoil. And I will scatter them to every wind, those whose hair is trimmed at the temples (a sign of their custom). And from every side, I will bring destruction upon them, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:33) 
And Hazor will become a dwelling for jackals, a desolation forever. No one will live there, nor will any human being dwell in it.

(Jeremiah 49:34) 
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying:

(Jeremiah 49:35) 
This is what the Lord of heavenly armies says: 'Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, which is their chief strength.'

(Jeremiah 49:36) 
And I will bring upon Elam four winds from the four corners of the universe; and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will be no nation to which the refugees of Elam will not go.

(Jeremiah 49:37) 
And I will cause Elam to be terrified before their enemies and before those who seek their lives. I will bring evil upon them, the fierceness of My wrath, says the Lord. And I will send the sword after them until I have consumed them.

(Jeremiah 49:38) 
And I will set My throne in Elam, and there I will destroy its kings and princes, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 49:39) 
But in the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:1) 
This is the message that the Lord spoke concerning Babylon, and concerning the land of the Chaldeans, given through Jeremiah the prophet.

(Jeremiah 50:2) 
Declare this among the nations; proclaim it loudly and make it known! Set up a signal; preach it openly and do not conceal it! Tell them: 'Babylon has been conquered! Bel, their false god, is shamed! Merodach, their idol, is broken! Her lifeless images are disgraced, their false gods are shattered!'

(Jeremiah 50:3) 
For a nation from the North has marched against Babylon. They will turn her land into a desolate wasteland, and no one will live there, neither people nor animals. Her people will flee and scatter.

(Jeremiah 50:4) 
In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the people of Israel and Judah will come together. They will come weeping, urgently seeking the Lord their God.

(Jeremiah 50:5) 
They will ask the way to Zion, their faces turned towards it with earnest desire. They will come and join themselves to the Lord through an everlasting covenant, one that will never be forgotten or broken.

(Jeremiah 50:6) 
My people have become a lost flock. Their leaders have led them astray, driving them to climb false mountains of sin. They wandered from hill to mountain, forgetting their true resting place and their spiritual home.

(Jeremiah 50:7) 
All who found them devoured them like prey. And their enemies justified themselves, saying: 'We are not guilty, for these people have sinned against the Lord, the very source of justice and glory, and the God whom their ancestors eagerly expected and worshipped.'

(Jeremiah 50:8) 
Flee from Babylon's midst! Get out of the land of the Chaldeans! Lead the way like rams at the head of a flock, guiding others to safety.

(Jeremiah 50:9) 
For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a great alliance of nations from the northern lands. They will prepare for battle against her, and from that very direction, Babylon will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a mighty warrior, striking true and not returning without their kill.

(Jeremiah 50:10) 
And the land of Chaldea will become plunder. All who plunder her will take their fill.

(Jeremiah 50:11) 
Because you rejoiced with shouts of triumph and plundered My chosen inheritance. Because you gamboled like calves in fresh pasture and bellowed like strong bulls in triumph.

(Jeremiah 50:12) 
Your mother—Babylon itself—is utterly shamed, and she who bore you is disgraced. Behold, she will be the lowliest among the nations, a desolate wasteland, without roads, and parched dry.

(Jeremiah 50:13) 
Because of the Lord's burning wrath, Babylon will remain uninhabited and become a complete wasteland. Every person who passes by Babylon will be struck with awe and will hiss in dismay at all her devastating wounds.

(Jeremiah 50:14) 
Form your battle lines all around Babylon, all of you who draw the bow! Fire your arrows at her; do not hold back a single arrow, for she has deeply sinned against the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:15) 
Shout the battle cry against her from every side! Babylon has surrendered! Her cities are overthrown, her mighty walls are torn down, for this is the Lord's vengeance. Take revenge on her; deal with her exactly as she dealt with others.

(Jeremiah 50:16) 
Cut off the sower in Babylon, and the one wielding the sickle at harvest time, so no future crops will grow. Because of the invaders' sword, everyone will flee back to their own people, and each person will escape to their homeland.

(Jeremiah 50:17) 
Israel is a scattered flock, driven away by ferocious lions. First, the king of Assyria devoured them. Then, this last one, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, crushed their bones.

(Jeremiah 50:18) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: 'Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria.'

(Jeremiah 50:19) 
And I will bring Israel back to their own dwelling place. And they will graze in the fertile lands of Carmel and Bashan, and on Mount Ephraim and Gilead their souls will be fully satisfied.

(Jeremiah 50:20) 
In those days and at that time, says the Lord, the iniquity of Israel will be sought out, but none will be found; the sin of Judah will be sought, but it will not be found. For I will graciously forgive those whom I have preserved.

(Jeremiah 50:21) 
Go up against the land of Merathaim—a land of double rebellion—and against the inhabitants of Pekod—a land of punishment. Completely destroy those who resist, and put to death those who follow them. Devote everything to utter destruction, says the Lord. Do everything I have commanded you.

(Jeremiah 50:22) 
The sound of battle echoes across the land, and the destruction is immense.

(Jeremiah 50:23) 
How completely broken and shattered is the hammer that struck down the whole earth—Babylon! How Babylon has become a wasteland among the nations!

(Jeremiah 50:24) 
I have set a trap for you, Babylon, and you are caught, completely unaware! You are discovered and seized, because you dared to defy the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:25) 
The Lord has opened His armory and brought forth the weapons of His wrath. For this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Jeremiah 50:26) 
Come against her from every border; break open her granaries until her goods lie in heaps. And utterly destroy, leaving no survivors; let nothing remain.

(Jeremiah 50:27) 
Slay all her mighty warriors; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come—the time of their destined punishment!

(Jeremiah 50:28) 
Listen! The sound of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon, they come to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God—the vengeance for His sacred Temple.

(Jeremiah 50:29) 
Summon many archers against Babylon, all you who draw the bow! Surround her completely; let no one escape! Repay her for her deeds; do to her exactly as she has done to others, because she has acted with arrogant pride against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.

(Jeremiah 50:30) 
Therefore, her young warriors will fall in her streets. And all her fighting men will be utterly silenced on that day, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 50:31) 
Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one! says the Lord God of hosts. For your day has come—the time of your deserved punishment.

(Jeremiah 50:32) 
And that arrogant one will stumble and fall, with no one to help her rise again. And I will kindle a fire in Babylon's cities, and it will consume everything around her.

(Jeremiah 50:33) 
This is what the Lord of hosts says: The people of Israel and Judah have both suffered severe oppression. And all who took them captive held them tightly, refusing to release them.

(Jeremiah 50:34) 
Their Redeemer is mighty; the Lord of hosts is His name. He will vigorously defend their cause in judgment, so that He may bring chaos upon the earth and shake the inhabitants of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 50:35) 
A sword of judgment hangs over the Chaldeans! says the Lord. It hangs over the inhabitants of Babylon, over her princes, and over her wise men.

(Jeremiah 50:36) 
A sword upon her diviners, and they will go mad with terror. A sword upon her mighty warriors, and they will be struck with fear.

(Jeremiah 50:37) 
A sword upon her warhorses and upon her chariots, and upon all the foreign mercenaries within her, and they will become as weak as women. A sword upon her treasures, and they will be plundered.

(Jeremiah 50:38) 
A drought upon her rivers and canals, and they will be dried up. Because it is a land full of carved images, and its people are driven to madness by their false gods.

(Jeremiah 50:39) 
Therefore, desert creatures will dwell there with howling animals, and ostriches will make their home in it. It will never again be inhabited, nor will it be rebuilt for all future generations.

(Jeremiah 50:40) 
Just as the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says the Lord, no man will live there, and no human being will settle in it.

(Jeremiah 50:41) 
Behold, a people is coming from the North—a great nation, and many kings will rise up from the far ends of the earth.

(Jeremiah 50:42) 
They seize bow and shield for battle. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their battle cries will roar like the surging sea, and they will advance on horses. They are arrayed for battle like a mighty warrior, against you, O daughter Babylon.

(Jeremiah 50:43) 
The king of Babylon has heard reports of them, and his hands have gone limp with fear. Anguish has gripped him, like the pain of a woman giving birth.

(Jeremiah 50:44) 
Behold, like a lion rising from the thickets of the Jordan, he will come against Babylon's strong and beautiful pastures. For I will suddenly make him rush against her. And who is the chosen one whom I will appoint to rule over her? For who is truly like Me? And who can stand against Me? And what shepherd, what ruler, can resist My face?

(Jeremiah 50:45) 
Therefore, listen to the plan of the Lord that He has formed against Babylon, and the intentions He has conceived concerning the land of the Chaldeans. Even the smallest of the flock, the weakest nations, will drag them away captive. Surely, their very dwelling place will be utterly destroyed along with them.

(Jeremiah 50:46) 
At the sound of Babylon's capture, the entire earth will tremble, and her cries will be heard among all the nations.

(Jeremiah 51:51:1) 
The Lord says this: "Pay attention! I am stirring up against Babylon and against its inhabitants—those living deep within its core, whom I have specifically chosen to be at the center of My punitive will—a wind that brings destruction and plague."

(Jeremiah 51:51:2) 
I will send against Babylon destroyers, who will winnow it and clear out its land, much like a farmer separates chaff from grain; because enemies will come against it from every direction on the day of its calamity.

(Jeremiah 51:51:3) 
Let the archer not prepare his bow; let him not rise up in his armor to fight. Do not spare its young men; put to death all its warriors.

(Jeremiah 51:51:4) 
The slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those wounded to death will lie in its streets.

(Jeremiah 51:51:5) 
For Israel and Judah have not been abandoned by their God, the Lord of armies, even though their own land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.

(Jeremiah 51:51:6) 
Flee from the midst of Babylon, and let each one save his own life! Do not remain silent about her wickedness, because this is the time of the Lord's vengeance; He Himself will repay her what she deserves.

(Jeremiah 51:51:7) 
Babylon was like a golden cup in the Lord's hand, intoxicating the whole earth. The nations drank of her wine, and for this reason, they were driven mad.

(Jeremiah 51:51:8) 
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and is shattered! Wail over her; get balm for her pain, in case she can still be healed.

(Jeremiah 51:51:9) 
"We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not healed. Let us abandon her, and let each one go to his own country; for her judgment has reached even to the skies, and is lifted up even to the clouds."

(Jeremiah 51:51:10) 
The Lord has brought forth our vindication. Come, let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.

(Jeremiah 51:51:11) 
Sharpen your arrows! Fill your quivers! The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes against Babylon to destroy it, for this is the Lord's vengeance—the vengeance for His Temple.

(Jeremiah 51:51:12) 
Raise a standard against the walls of Babylon! Increase the guard! Set watchmen! Prepare ambushes! For the Lord has planned and has done what He declared against the inhabitants of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 51:51:13) 
O you who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures! Your end has come, the measure of your greed is full.

(Jeremiah 51:51:14) 
The Lord of armies has sworn: "I will surely fill you with men like a swarm of locusts, and a shout of triumph will be raised over you."

(Jeremiah 51:51:15) 
It is He who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding He stretched out the skies and the rest of the universe.

(Jeremiah 51:51:16) 
At the sound of His voice, He brings forth the abundance of waters in the sky; He makes the clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He creates lightning with the rain, and He brings forth the wind from His storehouses.

(Jeremiah 51:51:17) 
Every human is proven foolish in their knowledge; every craftsman of idols is put to shame by his carved image; for his idol is a mere empty breath, and there is no true spirit or life within them.

(Jeremiah 51:51:18) 
They are useless, and a work worthy of ridicule. In the time of their judgment, they will perish completely.

(Jeremiah 51:51:19) 
The portion of Jacob is not like these empty idols; for He who formed all things, He is Jacob's God, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance. The Lord of armies is His name.

(Jeremiah 51:51:20) 
"You, O Babylon, are My hammer and My weapons of war. With you, I will smash nations; with you, I will destroy kingdoms.

(Jeremiah 51:51:21) 
With you, I will smash the horse and its rider; with you, I will smash the chariot and its driver.

(Jeremiah 51:51:22) 
With you, I will smash man and woman; with you, I will smash old and young; with you, I will smash the young man and the virgin.

(Jeremiah 51:51:23) 
With you, I will smash the shepherd and his flock; with you, I will smash the farmer and his team of oxen; with you, I will smash governors and rulers.

(Jeremiah 51:51:24) 
And I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil they inflicted upon Zion. You will see it with your own eyes," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:25) 
Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain—a great power that corrupts the whole earth! declares the Lord. I will stretch out My hand against you, and I will roll you down from the rocks, and I will make you a burnt-out mountain.

(Jeremiah 51:51:26) 
They will not take from you even a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation. Instead, you will be eternal desolation, says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:27) 
Raise a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Declare the nations holy for war against her! Summon against her the kings of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz! Appoint a commander over her! Bring up cavalry like a swarm of bristly locusts!

(Jeremiah 51:51:28) 
Prepare the nations against her for war: the kings of Media, their governors, all the rulers of all their lands, and their entire dominion.

(Jeremiah 51:51:29) 
Then the earth will quake and tremble, because the Lord's purpose against Babylon has awakened—to make the land of Babylon desolate and uninhabited.

(Jeremiah 51:51:30) 
The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength has withered, and they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire, her bars are broken.

(Jeremiah 51:51:31) 
Runner will come to runner, and messenger to messenger, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured from one end to the other.

(Jeremiah 51:51:32) 
The river crossings have been seized, and the marshes are burned with fire, and the warriors are terrified and in disarray.

(Jeremiah 51:51:33) 
For thus says the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor; the time for her to be trodden down is near. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest—her destruction—will come."

(Jeremiah 51:51:34) 
"Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has devoured me, he has crushed me. He has made me like an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a dragon, filled his belly with my delicacies, and then cast me aside."

(Jeremiah 51:51:35) 
The people of Zion will say: "May the injustice done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon!" And Jerusalem will say: "May my shed blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!"

(Jeremiah 51:51:36) 
Therefore, the Lord says this: "Behold, I will plead your case, and I will take vengeance on your behalf. I will dry up her sea—meaning her power and resources—and make her spring of fresh water run dry."

(Jeremiah 51:51:37) 
And Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a dwelling place for jackals, an object of horror and hissing, because no one will inhabit it.

(Jeremiah 51:51:38) 
They will roar together like lions; they will growl like lion cubs.

(Jeremiah 51:51:39) 
In their heat, I will give them their drinks; I will make them drunk so that they become sluggish and sleep an eternal sleep, and do not awaken," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:40) 
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with goats to be sacrificed.

(Jeremiah 51:51:41) 
How has Sheshach—a symbolic name for Babylon—been captured? How has the renown of the whole earth been seized? How has Babylon become an object of horror among the nations?

(Jeremiah 51:51:42) 
The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves, symbolizing overwhelming destruction.

(Jeremiah 51:51:43) 
Her cities have become a desolation, a land uninhabitable and deserted; a land where no one dwells, and no human being passes through it.

(Jeremiah 51:51:44) 
And I will punish Bel, the chief idol of Babylon, and I will make him vomit out what he has swallowed from his mouth. Nations will no longer flow to him in worship, and even the wall of Babylon will fall.

(Jeremiah 51:51:45) 
Go out from her midst, My people! Let each one save his own life from the fierce anger of the Lord!

(Jeremiah 51:51:46) 
And lest your heart should faint, and you should be afraid of the rumor that will be heard in the land—when a rumor comes in one year, and after that, in another year, another rumor, bringing injustice in the land, and ruler rising against ruler.

(Jeremiah 51:51:47) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming when I will punish the carved images of Babylon, and all her land will be put to shame, and all her slain will fall in her midst.

(Jeremiah 51:51:48) 
And the universe and the earth, and all that is in them, will sing for joy over Babylon, because destroyers will come against her from the north," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:49) 
Just as Babylon caused the slain to fall in Israel, so too in Babylon will the slain fall throughout all the earth.

(Jeremiah 51:51:50) 
You who have escaped the sword, come, do not stand still! Remember the Lord from afar, and let Jerusalem rise in your hearts.

(Jeremiah 51:51:51) 
"We are ashamed, because we have heard reproach; dishonor has covered our faces, for foreigners have come against the holy places of the Lord's house."

(Jeremiah 51:51:52) 
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will punish her carved images, and throughout all her land, the wounded will groan.

(Jeremiah 51:51:53) 
Even if Babylon should ascend to the very sky, and establish her strength firmly in the heights, from Me will come destroyers against her," says the Lord.

(Jeremiah 51:51:54) 
A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!

(Jeremiah 51:51:55) 
For the Lord will devastate Babylon and destroy its great voice—the clamor of its people. Its waves will roar like many waters, giving forth the sound of their tumult.

(Jeremiah 51:51:56) 
Because a destroyer comes upon her, that is, upon Babylon. Her mighty warriors will be captured, and their bows will be shattered; for the Lord is a strong avenger, surely rendering recompense.

(Jeremiah 51:51:57) 
"I will make her princes drunk, along with her wise men, her governors, her rulers, and her mighty warriors. They will sleep an eternal sleep and not awaken," says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies.

(Jeremiah 51:51:58) 
Thus says the Lord of armies: "The wide walls of Babylon will be utterly broken down, and her high gates will be burned with fire. The peoples have toiled in vain, and the nations have wearied themselves only for the fire."

(Jeremiah 51:51:59) 
This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to Seraiah, the son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, when Seraiah went with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the chief officer tasked with delivering prophetic messages.

(Jeremiah 51:51:60) 
Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the evil that was to come upon Babylon—all these words that are written against Babylon.

(Jeremiah 51:51:61) 
Jeremiah then said to Seraiah: "When you arrive in Babylon, and you see it, and you have read all these words—

(Jeremiah 51:51:62) 
you are to say: 'O Lord, You Yourself have spoken concerning this place, that You would destroy it, so that there will be no one living in it, neither man nor beast, and it will be an eternal desolation.'

(Jeremiah 51:51:63) 
And when you have finished reading this scroll, you are to tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.

(Jeremiah 51:51:64) 
And you are to say: 'Thus shall Babylon be submerged, and it will not rise from the face of the affliction that I will bring upon it, and it will be utterly broken.' Here ends the words of Jeremiah.

(Jeremiah 52:1) 
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.

(Jeremiah 52:2) 
And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Jehoiakim had done everything.

(Jeremiah 52:3) 
Because of the Lord's anger, these events happened to Jerusalem and Judah, until He cast them out of His sight. Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:4) 
In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, in the tenth month on the tenth day of that month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem with all his army. They surrounded the city and built siege works all around it.

(Jeremiah 52:5) 
The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah's reign.

(Jeremiah 52:6) 
In the fourth month, on the ninth day of that month, the famine in the city became severe, and there was no bread left for the people of the land.

(Jeremiah 52:7) 
The city wall was breached, and all the soldiers fled. They went out of the city by night through the gate between the two walls, which led to the king's garden. The Chaldeans were besieging the city all around. Zedekiah proceeded along the road through the desert plain.

(Jeremiah 52:8) 
The Chaldean army pursued the king and captured Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All the soldiers who were with him were scattered from him.

(Jeremiah 52:9) 
So they brought the captured king to the king of Babylon at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath. There, the king of Babylon passed judgment on him.

(Jeremiah 52:10) 
The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his very eyes. He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.

(Jeremiah 52:11) 
Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze chains. The king of Babylon brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.

(Jeremiah 52:12) 
In the fifth month, on the tenth day of that month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:13) 
And he burned the Lord's Temple, the king's palace, all the houses in Jerusalem, and every great house, burning them all with fire.

(Jeremiah 52:14) 
The entire Chaldean army, who were with the commander of the imperial guard, tore down all the walls around Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:15) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away into exile some of the poorest people, the remaining common people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

(Jeremiah 52:16) 
But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.

(Jeremiah 52:17) 
The Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the Lord's Temple, along with the bronze stands and the great bronze basin called 'the Sea' that was in the Lord's Temple. They carried all that bronze to Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:18) 
They also took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, bowls, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in the Temple service.

(Jeremiah 52:19) 
Furthermore, the commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, incense burners, pitchers, bowls, lampstands, dishes, and cups—whatever was gold, he took as gold; and whatever was silver, he took as silver.

(Jeremiah 52:20) 
There were two pillars, one great basin, and twelve bronze stands that King Solomon had made for the Lord's Temple. The weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.

(Jeremiah 52:21) 
As for the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits (about twenty-seven feet), and a cord of twelve cubits (about eighteen feet) went around it. Its thickness was four fingers (about three inches), and it was hollow inside.

(Jeremiah 52:22) 
There were bronze capitals on top of each pillar. The height of one capital was five cubits (about seven and a half feet), with a network of bronze pomegranates all around the capitals—all made of bronze. The second pillar was similar, also with pomegranates.

(Jeremiah 52:23) 
There were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down, and all the pomegranates on the network amounted to one hundred, surrounding it on all sides.

(Jeremiah 52:24) 
The commander of the imperial guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

(Jeremiah 52:25) 
From the city, he took one eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers. He also took seven men from those who stood near the king, who were found in the city. He took the commander of the army's scribe, who was responsible for conscripting the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.

(Jeremiah 52:26) 
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

(Jeremiah 52:27) 
The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah, in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away into exile from their own land.

(Jeremiah 52:28) 
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews.

(Jeremiah 52:29) 
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight thousand three hundred thirty-two people from Jerusalem.

(Jeremiah 52:30) 
In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the imperial guard, carried away seven hundred forty-five Jews. All the people carried into exile totaled four thousand six hundred.

(Jeremiah 52:31) 
It came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of that month, that Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and brought him out of prison.

(Jeremiah 52:32) 
He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a seat of honor higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.

(Jeremiah 52:33) 
Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he ate regularly in the king's presence for all the days of his life.

(Jeremiah 52:34) 
And as for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a set amount each day, until the day of his death.
