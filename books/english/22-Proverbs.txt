(Proverbs 1:1) 
These are the proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:

(Proverbs 1:2) 
Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline;

(Proverbs 1:3) 
To help you understand the words of the wise;

(Proverbs 1:4) 
To help you receive training in doctrine, justice, judgment, and equity;

(Proverbs 1:5) 
So that children may be prudent, and the young may have knowledge and understanding.

(Proverbs 1:6) 
The wise will listen, and become wiser; and those who understand will guide themselves well.

(Proverbs 1:7) 
The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and doctrine.

(Proverbs 1:8) 
Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and don't abandon the law of your mother:

(Proverbs 1:9) 
For these teachings will be a graceful ornament for your head, and a chain for your neck.

(Proverbs 1:10) 
My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.

(Proverbs 1:11) 
If they say, “Come with us, let us lay in wait for blood, let us hide snares against the innocent without cause:

(Proverbs 1:12) 
Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and the just as if he were going down into a pit:

(Proverbs 1:13) 
We shall find all precious substance, we will fill our houses with spoils:

(Proverbs 1:14) 
Cast in your lot among us, and let us all have one purse:

(Proverbs 1:15) 
My son, do not walk with them, restrain your foot from their paths:

(Proverbs 1:16) 
For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.

(Proverbs 1:17) 
But in vain the net is spread before the eyes of those who have wings.

(Proverbs 1:18) 
For they lie in wait against their own blood, and practice deceits against their own souls.

(Proverbs 1:19) 
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain: they take away the souls of their possessors.

(Proverbs 1:20) 
Wisdom cries out in the streets, she utters her voice in the squares:

(Proverbs 1:21) 
At the head of crowds she cries out, in the entrance of the gates she speaks:

(Proverbs 1:22) 
How long, O little ones, will you love childhood, and you fools desire what is hurtful to you?

(Proverbs 1:23) 
Turn to my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, and I will show you my words.

(Proverbs 1:24) 
Because I have called, and you refused: I have stretched out my hand, and there was no one who would listen:

(Proverbs 1:25) 
But you have treated all my counsel as nothing, and have neglected my reproofs:

(Proverbs 1:26) 
I also will laugh at your destruction: and I will mock when what you feared comes upon you,

(Proverbs 1:27) 
When sudden calamity falls upon you, and destruction comes like a storm: when tribulation and anguish come upon you.

(Proverbs 1:28) 
Then they will call upon me, and I will not hear: they will rise early in the morning, and they will not find me:

(Proverbs 1:29) 
Because they have despised knowledge, and have not chosen the fear of God:

(Proverbs 1:30) 
Nor have they willed my counsel, and have scorned my reproofs:

(Proverbs 1:31) 
Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and they shall be filled with their own devices.

(Proverbs 1:32) 
The turning away of the little ones will kill them, and the prosperity of fools will deceive them.

(Proverbs 1:33) 
But whoever believes in me, shall rest in hope, and shall abound with the fear of God.

(Proverbs 2:1) 
My son, if you receive my words and treasure my precepts,

(Proverbs 2:2) 
Then you will train your heart to understand, and turn your ear to wisdom.

(Proverbs 2:3) 
Yes, if you ask to understand, and if you direct your heart to discern wisdom—

(Proverbs 2:4) 
If you seek her like silver, and search for her like a treasure—

(Proverbs 2:5) 
Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and you will find the knowledge of God.

(Proverbs 2:6) 
For the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth comes understanding and insight.

(Proverbs 2:7) 
He treasures the honest. He protects the way of those who live blamelessly,

(Proverbs 2:8) 
preserving the paths of justice, and safeguarding the ways of the saints.

(Proverbs 2:9) 
Then you will understand justice and judgment and fairness, and every good path.

(Proverbs 2:10) 
If wisdom enters your heart, and knowledge delights your soul,

(Proverbs 2:11) 
Then counsel will protect you, and prudence will preserve you:

(Proverbs 2:12) 
to rescue you from the evil way, and from the man who speaks perverse things:

(Proverbs 2:13) 
those who abandon the straight path, and walk the dark paths:

(Proverbs 2:14) 
who rejoice when they do evil, and exult in the worst things:

(Proverbs 2:15) 
whose paths are crooked, and whose steps are twisted.

(Proverbs 2:16) 
And to deliver you from a strange woman, and from the foreigner who makes her words sweet:

(Proverbs 2:17) 
who abandons the husband of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.

(Proverbs 2:18) 
For her house is near death, and her paths lead to the underworld.

(Proverbs 2:19) 
All who enter her do not return, and do not sustain the right paths.

(Proverbs 2:20) 
So that a just man walks in his integrity: his steps are clear for one who walks the right way.

(Proverbs 2:21) 
For the upright shall inhabit the land, and the perfect will remain in it.

(Proverbs 2:22) 
But the wicked will be cut off from the earth: and those who deal unjustly will be removed from it.

(Proverbs 3:1) 
My son, don't forget my teachings, and let your heart guard my commandments.

(Proverbs 3:2) 
They will add to you long life, many years, and peace.

(Proverbs 3:3) 
Never forsake kindness and truth, but tie them around your neck, and write them on the tablets of your heart.

(Proverbs 3:4) 
Then you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and of men.

(Proverbs 3:5) 
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.

(Proverbs 3:6) 
In all your ways, give thought to Him, and He will direct your steps.

(Proverbs 3:7) 
Don’t think you are wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.

(Proverbs 3:8) 
This will be health for your navel, and nourishment for your bones.

(Proverbs 3:9) 
Honor the Lord with your possessions, and give Him the first fruits of your crops.

(Proverbs 3:10) 
Then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will overflow with wine.

(Proverbs 3:11) 
My son, do not reject the Lord’s discipline, nor be disgusted when you are corrected by Him:

(Proverbs 3:12) 
because the Lord corrects the one He loves, as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.

(Proverbs 3:13) 
Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who overflows with understanding:

(Proverbs 3:14) 
For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her revenue is better than fine gold.

(Proverbs 3:15) 
She is more precious than all gems, and nothing you desire can compare to her.

(Proverbs 3:16) 
Long life is in her right hand, and in her left hand are riches and honor.

(Proverbs 3:17) 
Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.

(Proverbs 3:18) 
She is a tree of life to those who grasp her, and happy is the one who holds her fast.

(Proverbs 3:19) 
The Lord by wisdom founded the earth, and by understanding He established the heavens.

(Proverbs 3:20) 
By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.

(Proverbs 3:21) 
My son, let these things not depart from your sight: keep sound wisdom and discretion.

(Proverbs 3:22) 
So they will be life for your soul and grace for your neck.

(Proverbs 3:23) 
Then you will go your way confidently, and your foot will not stumble.

(Proverbs 3:24) 
If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you sleep, your sleep will be sweet.

(Proverbs 3:25) 
Do not be afraid of sudden fear, nor of the ruin of the wicked when it comes.

(Proverbs 3:26) 
For the Lord will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being caught.

(Proverbs 3:27) 
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.

(Proverbs 3:28) 
Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back, and tomorrow I will give it,” when you have it with you.

(Proverbs 3:29) 
Do not plan evil against your neighbor, when he trusts in you.

(Proverbs 3:30) 
Do not quarrel with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.

(Proverbs 3:31) 
Do not envy the man of violence, nor choose any of his ways:

(Proverbs 3:32) 
because the perverse man is an abomination to the Lord, but He is intimate with the upright.

(Proverbs 3:33) 
The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the dwelling of the just.

(Proverbs 3:34) 
Truly, He mocks at the scornful, but gives grace to the humble.

(Proverbs 3:35) 
The wise will inherit glory, but fools will receive disgrace.

(Proverbs 4:1) 
Listen, sons, to the teachings of your father, and pay attention so you may understand wisdom.

(Proverbs 4:2) 
I will give you good teaching: don't abandon my law.

(Proverbs 4:3) 
I was a son of my father, gentle and beloved in the eyes of my mother.

(Proverbs 4:4) 
And he taught me, and said to me: “Keep my words in your heart, guard my precepts, and live by them.”

(Proverbs 4:5) 
Get wisdom, get understanding: don't forget, and don't turn away from the words of my mouth.

(Proverbs 4:6) 
Don't abandon her, and she will guard you; love her, and she will protect you.

(Proverbs 4:7) 
The beginning of wisdom is, get wisdom, and with all your possessions, acquire understanding.

(Proverbs 4:8) 
Embrace her, and she will exalt you; you will be glorified by her, when you have embraced her.

(Proverbs 4:9) 
She will give your head the grace of growth, and she will crown you with glory.

(Proverbs 4:10) 
Listen, my son, and accept my words, and the years of your life will multiply for you.

(Proverbs 4:11) 
I will show you the path of wisdom, and I will lead you in the footsteps of righteousness:

(Proverbs 4:12) 
when you enter it, your steps will not be constricted; and when you run, you will not have sadness.

(Proverbs 4:13) 
Take discipline, do not abandon it; guard it, because it is your life.

(Proverbs 4:14) 
Don't enter the path of the wicked, nor tread the way of sinners.

(Proverbs 4:15) 
Avoid it, and do not pass through it; turn away, and depart from it.

(Proverbs 4:16) 
For they do not sleep unless they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have tripped someone.

(Proverbs 4:17) 
For they eat the bread of ungodliness, and they drink the wine of iniquity.

(Proverbs 4:18) 
But the path of the just is like light traveling through space, and it will be made just until the perfect day.

(Proverbs 4:19) 
The way of the wicked is dark: they do not know where they fall.

(Proverbs 4:20) 
My son, pay attention to my words: and incline your ear to my sayings.

(Proverbs 4:21) 
Let them not depart from your eyes: guard them in the middle of your heart.

(Proverbs 4:22) 
For they are life to those who find them: and health to all flesh.

(Proverbs 4:23) 
Keep watch over your heart with every care: because from it, the ways of life come forth.

(Proverbs 4:24) 
Remove from you a perverse mouth, and put lying lips far from you.

(Proverbs 4:25) 
Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids direct your steps.

(Proverbs 4:26) 
Direct your steps, and make all your ways firm.

(Proverbs 4:27) 
Do not turn to the right or to the left: turn your foot away from evil.

(Proverbs 5:1) 
My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Give ear to my understanding.

(Proverbs 5:2) 
Keep discretion, and your lips will guard knowledge.

(Proverbs 5:3) 
Don't long for a woman who isn't your wife, and don't wander around her house.

(Proverbs 5:4) 
For the lips of a harlot are like a dripping honeycomb, and her throat is smoother than oil.

(Proverbs 5:5) 
But in the end, she is as bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.

(Proverbs 5:6) 
Her feet go down to death, and her steps lead straight to the grave.

(Proverbs 5:7) 
She doesn't walk the paths of life. Her steps are always wandering, and you can't predict where she will go.

(Proverbs 5:8) 
Now, my son, listen to me and don't turn away from the words I am saying.

(Proverbs 5:9) 
Keep your way far from her, and don't go near the door of her house.

(Proverbs 5:10) 
Lest you should give your honor to others, and your years to those who are cruel.

(Proverbs 5:11) 
Lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors in the house of someone else,

(Proverbs 5:12) 
And in the end you will regret it, when you've ruined your flesh and your body, and say:

(Proverbs 5:13) 
“How I hated discipline, and my heart scorned rebuke!

(Proverbs 5:14) 
I didn’t listen to the voice of those who taught me, nor did I pay attention to those who gave me instruction.

(Proverbs 5:15) 
I almost fell into every kind of evil in the middle of the Church and the synagogues.

(Proverbs 5:16) 
Drink water from your own cistern, and from the springs of your well.

(Proverbs 5:17) 
Let your springs be poured out outside, but divide your waters into the streets.

(Proverbs 5:18) 
Let them be yours alone, and not those of strangers with you.

(Proverbs 5:19) 
Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.

(Proverbs 5:20) 
A most beautiful hind, and a graceful deer. Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; always delight in her love.

(Proverbs 5:21) 
Why, my son, should you be ruined with a woman who isn’t your wife, and be embraced in the bosom of another?

(Proverbs 5:22) 
The works of a man are in the sight of the Lord, and He considers his ways.

(Proverbs 5:23) 
The wicked are caught in their own sins, and are held fast in the chains of their own offenses.

(Proverbs 6:1) 
My son, if you have agreed to be surety for your neighbor, and have pledged your word for another,

(Proverbs 6:2) 
you are ensnared by the words of your mouth, and taken captive by the words of your lips,

(Proverbs 6:3) 
do what I say, my son, and deliver yourself; because you have fallen into the hands of your neighbor: hasten and withdraw.

(Proverbs 6:4) 
Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.

(Proverbs 6:5) 
Be delivered as a roe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

(Proverbs 6:6) 
Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom.

(Proverbs 6:7) 
Which although she has no guide, nor master, nor lord,

(Proverbs 6:8) 
provides her food in the summer, and gathers in the harvest what she may eat.

(Proverbs 6:9) 
How long, you sluggard, will you sleep? When will you arise from your sleep?

(Proverbs 6:10) 
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest:

(Proverbs 6:11) 
and your poverty shall come as a traveler, and your want as an armed man.

(Proverbs 6:12) 
A wicked man, a man without law, walks with a perverse mouth.

(Proverbs 6:13) 
Who winks with his eyes, and presses with his feet, and speaks with his finger.

(Proverbs 6:14) 
Perversities are in his heart, he devises evil at all times, and sows discord.

(Proverbs 6:15) 
Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; he shall be broken suddenly, and shall no longer have a remedy.

(Proverbs 6:16) 
These six things the Lord hates, and the seventh his soul hates:

(Proverbs 6:17) 
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,

(Proverbs 6:18) 
a heart that devises wicked plots, feet swift to run into evil,

(Proverbs 6:19) 
a false witness that utters lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.

(Proverbs 6:20) 
Keep, my son, the precepts of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:

(Proverbs 6:21) 
Bind them continually in your heart, and put them around your neck.

(Proverbs 6:22) 
When you walk, let them go with you; when you sleep, let them keep you; and when you wake, speak with them.

(Proverbs 6:23) 
Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and the way of life is the reproof of discipline:

(Proverbs 6:24) 
That you may keep yourself from the evil woman, and from the flattery of the tongue of the stranger.

(Proverbs 6:25) 
Desire not her beauty in your heart, neither be caught with her eyelids.

(Proverbs 6:26) 
For a harlot's sustenance is to the morsel of bread: and the strange woman hunts for the precious soul.

(Proverbs 6:27) 
Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not be burned?

(Proverbs 6:28) 
Or who can walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

(Proverbs 6:29) 
So is he that goes in to his neighbor's wife; he shall not be clean that touches her.

(Proverbs 6:30) 
It is no fault in him that steals when he is hungry, that he may fill his soul.

(Proverbs 6:31) 
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give all the substance of his house.

(Proverbs 6:32) 
He that commits adultery is foolish: but he that would destroy his own soul does it.

(Proverbs 6:33) 
He gathers to himself disgrace and infamy, and his shame shall not be blotted out.

(Proverbs 6:34) 
For the jealousy of a husband provokes wrath: nor will he spare in the day of revenge.

(Proverbs 6:35) 
Nor will he accept any man's prayers, nor will he be appeased by any amount of compensation.

(Proverbs 7:1) 
My son, always remember and guard what I teach you. Always keep in your heart the wisdom I give you.

(Proverbs 7:2) 
Keep my commands, and you will live. Treasure my law like the pupil of your eye.

(Proverbs 7:3) 
Tie my wisdom to your fingers to remind you. Write it on the tablets of your heart.

(Proverbs 7:4) 
Say to wisdom: “You are my sister.” Call prudence your closest friend:

(Proverbs 7:5) 
So that they will guard you against a strange woman. Against the one who flatters with her words.

(Proverbs 7:6) 
Once I looked out the window of my house. I peered through the lattice,

(Proverbs 7:7) 
And I saw some naive young men. I noticed a young man with no common sense among them.

(Proverbs 7:8) 
He was going down the street near her corner. He was walking near the door of her house,

(Proverbs 7:9) 
in the twilight, as it was getting dark, in the middle of the night,

(Proverbs 7:10) 
Suddenly, a woman came to meet him. She was dressed like a prostitute, ready to deceive the hearts of fools.

(Proverbs 7:11) 
She was loud and defiant. Her feet never stayed in one place.

(Proverbs 7:12) 
She was now in the streets, now in the squares, now near every corner, lurking near the road.

(Proverbs 7:13) 
She grabbed him and kissed him. She then said to him with a brazen face:

(Proverbs 7:14) 
“I had to offer sacrifices for my safety. Today, I have paid my vows.

(Proverbs 7:15) 
So I came out to meet you. I wanted you, and I found you!

(Proverbs 7:16) 
I have spread my bed with tapestries, with fine linens from Egypt.

(Proverbs 7:17) 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

(Proverbs 7:18) 
Come, let's drink our fill of love, and enjoy each other's company until morning. My husband isn’t home,

(Proverbs 7:19) 
He has gone on a long journey.

(Proverbs 7:20) 
He took a bag of money with him. He will return home on the appointed day.”

(Proverbs 7:21) 
With her seductive words, she persuaded him. She enticed him with her flattering lips.

(Proverbs 7:22) 
Immediately he followed her like an ox to the slaughter, like a fool going to be punished, not knowing that he was going to be punished,

(Proverbs 7:23) 
until an arrow pierces his liver. Like a bird darting into a snare, unaware that it’s a matter of life and death.

(Proverbs 7:24) 
Now, my son, listen to me and pay attention to the words of my mouth.

(Proverbs 7:25) 
Do not let your heart turn to her ways, and do not stray on her paths.

(Proverbs 7:26) 
Because she has caused many to be wounded and killed. She has killed many of the strongest men.

(Proverbs 7:27) 
Her house is the way to the grave; it descends to the chambers of death.

(Proverbs 8:1) 
Doesn't wisdom cry out? Doesn't careful thought raise its voice?

(Proverbs 8:2) 
Wisdom stands in the highest places, in the middle of the public roads,

(Proverbs 8:3) 
near the city gates, and it is the first thing people hear.

(Proverbs 8:4) 
“I call out to you, men. My voice is for all people.

(Proverbs 8:5) 
You who are foolish, learn common sense. You who are simple, apply your minds.

(Proverbs 8:6) 
Listen, because I will speak of great things. I will open my lips to say what is right.

(Proverbs 8:7) 
My mouth will proclaim truth. My lips hate wicked speech.

(Proverbs 8:8) 
All my words are just. There is nothing twisted or wrong in them.

(Proverbs 8:9) 
Everything is clear to those who understand, and truth will come to those who know.

(Proverbs 8:10) 
Accept my instruction, not money; and knowledge more than the purest gold.

(Proverbs 8:11) 
For wisdom is better than jewels, and nothing desired is comparable to it.

(Proverbs 8:12) 
“I, Wisdom, dwell in counsel. I am present in thoughtful consideration.

(Proverbs 8:13) 
To fear the Lord is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, a bad path, and a deceitful mouth.

(Proverbs 8:14) 
I have counsel and righteousness. I have prudence, I have strength.

(Proverbs 8:15) 
By me, kings reign, and rulers decree what is just.

(Proverbs 8:16) 
Through me, princes command, and the powerful decree justice.

(Proverbs 8:17) 
I love those who love me. Those who seek me early will find me.

(Proverbs 8:18) 
Riches and glory are with me, as are wealth and righteousness.

(Proverbs 8:19) 
My fruit is better than gold and precious stones; and my produce is better than refined silver.

(Proverbs 8:20) 
I walk in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of judgment.

(Proverbs 8:21) 
So that I may enrich those who love me and fill their treasuries.

(Proverbs 8:22) 
The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways, before He made anything else.

(Proverbs 8:23) 
From eternity, I was ordained, from the beginning, before the earth was made.

(Proverbs 8:24) 
Before there were deep seas, I was already conceived; before the springs of water flowed forth:

(Proverbs 8:25) 
Before the mountains were formed, I was born before the hills.

(Proverbs 8:26) 
Before He had made the land, the rivers, and the foundations of the earth, I was there.

(Proverbs 8:27) 
When He prepared the universe, I was there; when He established the sky above the oceans,

(Proverbs 8:28) 
when He strengthened the clouds above, and secured the fountains of the deep,

(Proverbs 8:29) 
when He established the sea's boundaries, and a law so the water wouldn't cross them, and when He laid the foundations of the earth,

(Proverbs 8:30) 
then I was with Him, arranging everything. And I rejoiced daily, playing before Him all the time,

(Proverbs 8:31) 
playing in the world; and my delight was to be with the children of men.

(Proverbs 8:32) 
So now, children, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.

(Proverbs 8:33) 
Listen to instruction and be wise; do not cast it away.

(Proverbs 8:34) 
Blessed is the man who hears me, and who watches at my doors every day, and observes the posts of my doors.

(Proverbs 8:35) 
Whoever finds me finds life and will receive salvation from the Lord.

(Proverbs 8:36) 
But whoever sins against me harms his own soul. All who hate me love death.

(Proverbs 9:1) 
Wisdom has built herself a house; she has carved out seven columns.

(Proverbs 9:2) 
She has prepared her sacrifices, mixed her wine, and set up her table.

(Proverbs 9:3) 
She sent her servants to call out from the highest points and the walls of the city:

(Proverbs 9:4) 
"Whoever is young, let him come to me," and she spoke to those who lacked understanding:

(Proverbs 9:5) 
"Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed for you:

(Proverbs 9:6) 
Abandon your ignorance, and you will live, and walk in the path of prudence."

(Proverbs 9:7) 
He who instructs a scoffer harms himself; he who reproves the wicked brings shame upon himself.

(Proverbs 9:8) 
Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.

(Proverbs 9:9) 
Give an opportunity to a wise man, and wisdom will be added to him; teach a just man, and he will increase in his learning.

(Proverbs 9:10) 
Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the saints is prudence.

(Proverbs 9:11) 
Through me, your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you.

(Proverbs 9:12) 
If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you are a scoffer, you alone will bear the evil.

(Proverbs 9:13) 
Folly is a loud, foolish woman, knowing nothing.

(Proverbs 9:14) 
She sits at the doors of her house, on a seat, in the high places of the city,

(Proverbs 9:15) 
to call out to those passing by on the road, who go on their way:

(Proverbs 9:16) 
"Whoever is young, let him come to me;" and she spoke to the foolish:

(Proverbs 9:17) 
“Stolen water is sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant."

(Proverbs 9:18) 
But she does not know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.

(Proverbs 10:1) 
Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son is the sadness of his mother.

(Proverbs 10:2) 
Treasures gained through evil will not last, but righteousness delivers from death.

(Proverbs 10:3) 
The Lord will not let the just go hungry, but He sends away the desires of the wicked.

(Proverbs 10:4) 
A lazy hand makes a man poor, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.

(Proverbs 10:5) 
He who gathers in the harvest is a wise son, but he who sleeps during the harvest is a shameful son.

(Proverbs 10:6) 
Blessings are on the head of the just, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.

(Proverbs 10:7) 
The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked rots.

(Proverbs 10:8)
