(1 Peter 1:1) 
Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, writes this letter to God's chosen ones—all those who live as spiritual exiles, scattered throughout the regions of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

(1 Peter 1:2) 
These chosen ones are known by the foreknowledge of God the Father, and they are set apart by the Holy Spirit for a life of obedience, purified by the sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied abundantly in you.

(1 Peter 1:3) 
Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of His immense mercy, He has given us new birth, so that we now live in a true and living hope, all through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

(1 Peter 1:4) 
This new birth leads to an inheritance that can never decay, spoil, or fade away—an inheritance kept safe in heaven for all of you.

(1 Peter 1:5) 
Through your faith, you are being guarded by the power of God for a salvation that is ready to be fully revealed in the last days of this age.

(1 Peter 1:6) 
Because of this hope, you will greatly rejoice, even though for a short time—if it is necessary—you may have to suffer various trials and tests.

(1 Peter 1:7) 
This happens so that the genuineness of your faith—which is far more precious than perishable gold, even gold refined by fire—may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is fully revealed.

(1 Peter 1:8) 
Even though you have never seen Him, you love Him. And even though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him. And because you believe, you rejoice with an inexpressible joy that is already filled with glory.

(1 Peter 1:9) 
You are already receiving the ultimate goal of your faith: the salvation of your souls.

(1 Peter 1:10) 
Concerning this very salvation, the prophets of old meticulously searched and diligently inquired. They were the ones who prophesied about the grace that would eventually come to you.

(1 Peter 1:11) 
They were earnestly seeking to understand what specific time or circumstances the Spirit of Christ, who was within them, was indicating. The Spirit had foretold Christ's sufferings and the glories that would follow.

(1 Peter 1:12) 
It was revealed to those prophets that they were not serving themselves, but rather serving you, when they ministered these truths. Now, these same truths have been announced to you through those who preached the Gospel to you, empowered by the Holy Spirit sent from God's heavenly domain. These are truths so profound that even the angels long to look into them.

(1 Peter 1:13) 
Therefore, prepare your minds for action by mentally girding yourselves, and be alert and self-controlled. Place your complete hope in the grace that will be brought to you at the full revelation of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 1:14) 
As truly obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the evil desires that you once had when you lived in ignorance of God's ways.

(1 Peter 1:15) 
Instead, just as the One who called you is holy, you yourselves must also be holy in all aspects of your conduct and way of life.

(1 Peter 1:16) 
For the Scripture says: 'You shall be holy, because I am holy.'

(1 Peter 1:17) 
And if you call upon Him as Father—the One who judges each person's actions impartially, without favoritism—then live your lives in reverent fear during this time of your earthly pilgrimage.

(1 Peter 1:18) 
For you know very well that you were not set free from your futile way of life, inherited from your ancestors, by anything perishable like silver or gold.

(1 Peter 1:19) 
Instead, you were set free by the precious Blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.

(1 Peter 1:20) 
He was known by God the Father before the creation of the world, but He was fully revealed in these last times for your sake.

(1 Peter 1:21) 
Through Christ, you are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory. This was done so that your faith and hope might be securely placed in God.

(1 Peter 1:22) 
Now that you have purified your souls through obedience to the truth, leading to sincere fraternal love, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.

(1 Peter 1:23) 
You have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed, through the living and eternally enduring Word of God.

(1 Peter 1:24) 
For 'All human life is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, and the flower falls away.'

(1 Peter 1:25) 
But the Word of the Lord remains forever.' This is the very Word that was proclaimed to you through the Gospel.

(1 Peter 2:1) 
Therefore, you must put away all malice, all deceit, all hypocrisy, all envy, and all forms of slander.

(1 Peter 2:2) 
Like spiritual newborns, you must truly desire the pure, unadulterated spiritual milk of God's truth, so that by it you may grow in the Lord and attain salvation.

(1 Peter 2:3) 
Do this especially if you have already experienced how good the Lord is.

(1 Peter 2:4) 
Come to Jesus, the Living Stone. He was rejected by men, yet God chose Him and honored Him greatly.

(1 Peter 2:5) 
You yourselves are also like living stones, being built into a spiritual house. This house is a holy priesthood, whose purpose is to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

(1 Peter 2:6) 
For this reason, the Scripture states: 'Behold, I am placing in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen and precious. Whoever believes in Him will never be put to shame.'

(1 Peter 2:7) 
Therefore, honor belongs to you who believe. But for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner—the most important stone.

(1 Peter 2:8) 
To unbelievers, He is a stumbling stone and a rock that causes them to fall. They stumble because they disobey the word of God by not believing in Him, and this is the purpose for which they were appointed.

(1 Peter 2:9) 
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God Himself. You are chosen so that you may proclaim the wonderful works of Him who called you out of the darkness of sin and into His marvelous light.

(1 Peter 2:10) 
In the past, you were not God's people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received God's mercy.

(1 Peter 2:11) 
Beloved, I urge you as temporary residents and sojourners in this world to abstain from fleshly desires. These desires war against your very soul.

(1 Peter 2:12) 
Maintain excellent conduct among the Gentiles. Then, even when they falsely accuse you as evildoers, they will observe your good works. In doing so, they will give glory to God when He comes to judge the world.

(1 Peter 2:13) 
Be subject to every human authority for the Lord's sake. This includes the king as the supreme authority.

(1 Peter 2:14) 
It also includes governors who are sent by the king to punish evildoers and to praise those who do good.

(1 Peter 2:15) 
For it is God's will that by doing good, you silence the ignorant accusations of foolish people.

(1 Peter 2:16) 
Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cloak to conceal evil. Instead, live as servants of God.

(1 Peter 2:17) 
Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood of believers. Fear God above all. Honor the king.

(1 Peter 2:18) 
Servants, be subject to your masters with all reverence. This applies not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are difficult or harsh.

(1 Peter 2:19) 
For this is a gracious act in the eyes of God: if, because of your devotion and conscience toward God, you endure sorrows, even when suffering unjustly.

(1 Peter 2:20) 
What glory is there if you endure a beating when you have sinned? But if you endure patiently while doing good, this is truly a gracious act in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 2:21) 
For you were called to this very purpose: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example so that you might follow in His footsteps.

(1 Peter 2:22) 
He committed no sin, and no deceit was ever found in His mouth.

(1 Peter 2:23) 
When He was reviled with insults, He did not return insults. When He suffered, He did not threaten vengeance. Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges righteously.

(1 Peter 2:24) 
He Himself carried our sins in His own body on the wood of the Cross. This was so that we, having died to the power of sin, might live for righteousness. By His wounds, you have been healed of your spiritual maladies.

(1 Peter 2:25) 
For you were like sheep who had gone astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.

(1 Peter 3:1) 
Likewise, wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if some of them are disobedient to the Gospel, you may win them over not by preaching, but by your chaste conduct, lived in proper reverence and respect for God.

(1 Peter 3:2) 
They will observe your pure, chaste, and respectful behavior.

(1 Peter 3:3) 
Your adornment should not be merely an outward display of elaborate hairstyles, or of gold jewelry, or of dressing in fashionable clothing.

(1 Peter 3:4) 
Rather, let your beauty be the hidden inner person of the heart, manifested by the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious and valuable in the sight of God.

(1 Peter 3:5) 
For this is how the holy women of old, who put their hope in God, used to adorn themselves: by being submissive to their own husbands.

(1 Peter 3:6) 
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him 'lord' as a sign of respect. You are her true spiritual daughters if you do good and are not intimidated by any kind of fear that might arise from your good actions.

(1 Peter 3:7) 
Husbands, likewise, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the female, considering her the physically weaker vessel. Also, regard them as co-heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.

(1 Peter 3:8) 
Finally, all of you should be of one mind and purpose, sympathetic to one another, loving as brothers and sisters, compassionate, humble in spirit.

(1 Peter 3:9) 
Do not return evil for evil, nor insult for insult. Instead, return a blessing; for this is why God has called you: to inherit a blessing from Him.

(1 Peter 3:10) 
For he who desires to love life and to see good days must keep his tongue from speaking evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.

(1 Peter 3:11) 
He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and actively pursue it.

(1 Peter 3:12) 
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers. But the face of the Lord is set against those who do evil.

(1 Peter 3:13) 
And who will harm you if you are zealous for what is good and eager to do it?

(1 Peter 3:14) 
But even if you suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear the threats of those who oppose you, and do not be troubled by them.

(1 Peter 3:15) 
Instead, sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always be ready to give an adequate explanation to anyone who asks you for the reason for the hope that is within you.

(1 Peter 3:16) 
But do this with gentleness and reverence, maintaining a good conscience. Then, in the very matter that they speak evil of you, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ will be shamed.

(1 Peter 3:17) 
For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is God's will, than to suffer for doing evil.

(1 Peter 3:18) 
For Christ also suffered once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but brought to life by the Holy Spirit.

(1 Peter 3:19) 
In this same Holy Spirit, He also went and proclaimed His victory to the spirits who were being held in the realm of the dead.

(1 Peter 3:20) 
These were the ones who were disobedient long ago, when God's patience waited during the days of Noah, as the ark was being built. In that ark, a few—that is, eight souls—were saved through water.

(1 Peter 3:21) 
Baptism, which is a corresponding sign to that event, now saves you as well. It is not merely the removal of dirt from the body, but rather the appeal or commitment of a good conscience to God, made possible through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

(1 Peter 3:22) 
He is now at the right hand of God, having completely swallowed death so that we might be made heirs of eternal life. He has ascended into the created universe, to a place beyond our sight, and all angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to Him.

(1 Peter 4:1) 
Since Christ suffered for you in the flesh, you also should arm yourselves with the same mindset. This is the mindset that whoever suffers in the flesh—as Christ did—is finished with the life of sin.

(1 Peter 4:2) 
This means that for the rest of your time in this bodily life, you should no longer live according to worldly human desires, but according to the will and commandments of God.

(1 Peter 4:3) 
The time you have already spent living according to the ways of non-believers is enough. That past life was filled with excessive pleasures, sinful desires, habitual drunkenness, wild parties, public carousing, and the forbidden worship of idols.

(1 Peter 4:4) 
Because you no longer join them in that same flood of debauchery and sin, they are surprised. And because they are surprised, they speak evil of you and blaspheme God.

(1 Peter 4:5) 
But those who blaspheme you will have to give an account to the Lord. He is prepared and ready to judge all people, both those who are still alive and those who have died.

(1 Peter 4:6) 
For this very purpose, the Good News was also preached to those who are now dead in their bodies. The purpose was that even though they might be judged in their human nature by men —meaning they suffered physical death—they might still live in their spirit according to the eternal life given by God.

(1 Peter 4:7) 
Now, the culmination and end of all things is drawing near. Therefore, be clear-headed and exercise self-control, and be watchful and diligent in your prayers.

(1 Peter 4:8) 
But above all these things, maintain a fervent and constant divine charity for one another. This is because divine charity—supernatural love—covers a multitude of sins.

(1 Peter 4:9) 
Practice hospitality to one another without grumbling or complaining about the inconvenience.

(1 Peter 4:10) 
Each person, according to the specific divine gift of grace he has received, should use that grace to serve one another. Act as good and faithful stewards of God's varied and multifaceted grace.

(1 Peter 4:11) 
If anyone speaks to the community, he should speak as if delivering the very words of God Himself. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength and spiritual power that God Himself supplies. This is all so that in every action, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him alone belongs all glory and dominion for all ages and eternity. Amen.

(1 Peter 4:12) 
My dearly beloved, do not be surprised or consider it something strange when you experience the fiery trials that come to test your faith. Do not act as if something utterly new or unexpected is happening to you.

(1 Peter 4:13) 
Instead, find joy in the fact that you share in the sufferings of Christ. This is so that when His glory is finally revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding gladness and triumph.

(1 Peter 4:14) 
If you are insulted or reproached for the sake of the name of Christ, then you are truly blessed. For the Spirit of glory, which is the very Spirit of God, rests upon you and dwells within you.

(1 Peter 4:15) 
However, let none of you suffer justly as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody interfering in other people's affairs.

(1 Peter 4:16) 
But if someone suffers for being a Christian, he should not be ashamed of that name. Instead, he should glorify God because he bears that holy name.

(1 Peter 4:17) 
For the appointed time has now come for judgment to begin with the household of God—meaning, with the Church and its members. And if judgment begins first with us, what will be the ultimate end of those who do not believe and obey the Good News of God?

(1 Peter 4:18) 
And if even the righteous person is saved only with great difficulty and by God’s immense mercy, where will the ungodly and the persistent sinner find a place to stand on the Day of Judgment?

(1 Peter 4:19) 
Therefore, let those who suffer according to the providential will of God entrust and commit their souls to Him, their faithful Creator, while continuing to do good and holy works.

(1 Peter 5:1) 
Therefore, I, who am also an elder, appeal to the elders who are among you—
I am a witness of Christ’s sufferings,
and I am a sharer in the glory that will be revealed in the future.

(1 Peter 5:2) 
Shepherd the flock of God that is entrusted to you,
overseeing them not because you are forced to, but willingly, just as God desires.
Do not do it for shameful financial gain, but with eager willingness.

(1 Peter 5:3) 
Do not act as if you are domineering over the people of God,
but rather become genuine examples to the flock, from the heart.

(1 Peter 5:4) 
And when Christ, the Chief Shepherd, appears,
you will certainly receive the unfading crown of glory.

(1 Peter 5:5) 
In the same way, you younger ones, be subject to the elders.
And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility towards one another,
because God resists the proud, but He gives His grace to the humble.

(1 Peter 5:6) 
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,
so that He may exalt you when His time of visitation comes.

(1 Peter 5:7) 
Cast all your anxiety and worries upon Him,
because He cares for you personally.

(1 Peter 5:8) 
Be sober and keep watch:
because your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
seeking someone to devour.

(1 Peter 5:9) 
Resist him, standing firm in your faith,
knowing that the very same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brothers and sisters throughout the entire world.

(1 Peter 5:10) 
But the God of all grace, who has called us into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus,
after you have suffered a little while, He Himself will perfect you,
He will confirm you, He will strengthen you, and He will establish you firmly.

(1 Peter 5:11) 
To Him be glory and dominion for all ages of ages. Amen.

(1 Peter 5:12) 
Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother to you, I have written briefly,
exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you now stand firm.

(1 Peter 5:13) 
The Church, which is in Babylon (Rome), chosen together with you, sends you greetings,
and so does Mark, my spiritual son.

(1 Peter 5:14) 
Greet one another with a holy kiss, a sign of Christian fellowship.
Grace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
