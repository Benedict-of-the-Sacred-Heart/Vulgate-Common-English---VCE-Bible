(Colossians 1:1) 
Paul, sent on a mission by the will of God, along with our brother Timothy,

(Colossians 1:2) 
to the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ living in Colossae. May grace and peace come to you from God our Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Colossians 1:3) 
We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,

(Colossians 1:4) 
because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints,

(Colossians 1:5) 
which is founded on the hope you have in the universe. You learned about this hope through the message of the Gospel, which is the truth,

(Colossians 1:6) 
the same Gospel that has come to you and is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God’s grace in all its truth.

(Colossians 1:7) 
You learned this from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,

(Colossians 1:8) 
and who also told us about your love in the Spirit.

(Colossians 1:9) 
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,

(Colossians 1:10) 
so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,

(Colossians 1:11) 
being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience,

(Colossians 1:12) 
and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.

(Colossians 1:13) 
For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,

(Colossians 1:14) 
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

(Colossians 1:15) 
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation,

(Colossians 1:16) 
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.

(Colossians 1:17) 
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

(Colossians 1:18) 
And he is the head of the body, the Church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

(Colossians 1:19) 
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,

(Colossians 1:20) 
and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

(Colossians 1:21) 
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.

(Colossians 1:22) 
But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation.

(Colossians 1:23) 
If you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

(Colossians 1:24) 
Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church,

(Colossians 1:25) 
I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to present to you the word of God in its fullness.

(Colossians 1:26) 
This mystery, which has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s holy people.

(Colossians 1:27) 
To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

(Colossians 1:28) 
We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.

(Colossians 1:29) 
To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.

(Colossians 2:1) 
I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for everyone who has never seen my face in person.

(Colossians 2:2) 
I want them to be encouraged and united by love, enriched with a full understanding, and with the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father, and of Christ.

(Colossians 2:3) 
In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

(Colossians 2:4) 
I say this so that no one will deceive you with smooth words.

(Colossians 2:5) 
Though I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit. I am glad to see your order and the strength of your faith in Christ.

(Colossians 2:6) 
Therefore, since you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him.

(Colossians 2:7) 
Be rooted and built up in him, and strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness.

(Colossians 2:8) 
Be careful that no one deceives you with philosophy, empty deceit, the tradition of men, the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.

(Colossians 2:9) 
For in Christ lives all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.

(Colossians 2:10) 
And you have been filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power.

(Colossians 2:11) 
In him you were also circumcised, but not with a circumcision done by human hands; you were set free from the sinful nature of the body, by the circumcision of Christ.

(Colossians 2:12) 
You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.

(Colossians 2:13) 
And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,

(Colossians 2:14) 
blotting out the written code of the decrees that was against us, which was contrary to us; he took it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.

(Colossians 2:15) 
He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.

(Colossians 2:16) 
Therefore, do not let anyone judge you in respect to food or drink or in respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath.

(Colossians 2:17) 
These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.

(Colossians 2:18) 
Do not let anyone defraud you of your prize by insisting on self-abasement and the worship of angels, dwelling on things that he has not seen, puffed up without cause by his sensuous mind,

(Colossians 2:19) 
and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

(Colossians 2:20) 
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as though you were still living in the world, do you submit to regulations—

(Colossians 2:21) 
“Do not handle,” “Do not taste,” “Do not touch”

(Colossians 2:22) 
(which all are destined to perish with use)—according to human precepts and teachings?

(Colossians 2:23) 
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severity to the body, but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh.

(Colossians 3:1) 
Since you are resurrected with Christ, you should seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God:

(Colossians 3:2) 
You should focus on the things above, not the things of the earth.

(Colossians 3:3) 
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

(Colossians 3:4) 
When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.

(Colossians 3:5) 
Therefore, you must put to death the members of your body that are on the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is the worship of idols.

(Colossians 3:6) 
Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon those who do not believe.

(Colossians 3:7) 
In these things, you too once walked, when you lived among them.

(Colossians 3:8) 
But now, you must rid yourselves of all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and foul language from your mouth.

(Colossians 3:9) 
Do not lie to each other, stripping off the old self with its practices,

(Colossians 3:10) 
and putting on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its Creator,

(Colossians 3:11) 
where there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all.

(Colossians 3:12) 
Therefore, as the chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,

(Colossians 3:13) 
bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must forgive.

(Colossians 3:14) 
Above all these things, have love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

(Colossians 3:15) 
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.

(Colossians 3:16) 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

(Colossians 3:17) 
And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

(Colossians 3:18) 
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

(Colossians 3:19) 
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

(Colossians 3:20) 
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.

(Colossians 3:21) 
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, so they do not become discouraged.

(Colossians 3:22) 
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while they are watching, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.

(Colossians 3:23) 
Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

(Colossians 3:24) 
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.

(Colossians 3:25) 
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for his wrongs, and there is no partiality.

(Colossians 4:1) 
Masters, give to your servants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the universe.

(Colossians 4:2) 
Be persistent in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

(Colossians 4:3) 
Pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound),

(Colossians 4:4) 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

(Colossians 4:5) 
Walk with wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.

(Colossians 4:6) 
Let your speech always be in grace, seasoned with salt: so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.

(Colossians 4:7) 
All that concerns me, and what I do, Tychicus, the most dear brother, and faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you:

(Colossians 4:8) 
whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts,

(Colossians 4:9) 
with Onesimus, a faithful and most dear brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things that are done here.

(Colossians 4:10) 
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, salutes you; and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you have received commands: if he comes to you, receive him:

(Colossians 4:11) 
and Jesus, who is called Justus: who are of the circumcision. These alone are fellow workers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.

(Colossians 4:12) 
Epaphras, who is one of you, the servant of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.

(Colossians 4:13) 
For I bear him witness that he has much labor for you, and for those who are at Laodicea, and for those who are at Hierapolis.

(Colossians 4:14) 
Luke, the most dear physician, salutes you, and Demas.

(Colossians 4:15) 
Salute the brothers who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.

(Colossians 4:16) 
And when this letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that which is [sent] from Laodicea, read that also among yourselves.

(Colossians 4:17) 
And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”

(Colossians 4:18) 
The greeting by the hand of Paul. Be mindful of my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
