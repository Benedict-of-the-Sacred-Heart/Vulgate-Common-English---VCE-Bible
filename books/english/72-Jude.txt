(Jude 1:1) 
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, writes to those who are loved by God the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ, and called to His purpose.

(Jude 1:2) 
May mercy, peace, and divine love be abundantly multiplied to you.

(Jude 1:3) 
Beloved, I was diligently preparing to write to you about our common salvation, but I felt it was necessary to write and urge you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once and for all delivered to the saints.

(Jude 1:4) 
For certain godless men have secretly slipped in among you—men long ago marked out for this condemnation—who pervert the grace of our God into licentiousness, denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:5) 
Now I want to remind you, even though you once understood all these things, that the Lord, after saving His people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those who did not believe.

(Jude 1:6) 
And the angels who did not keep their proper domain but abandoned their own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.

(Jude 1:7) 
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, in a similar manner, indulged in gross sexual immorality and went after unnatural lust, they serve as an example, undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

(Jude 1:8) 
Likewise, these dreamers—the false teachers—defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the divine majesty of God and His angels.

(Jude 1:9) 
Yet Archangel Michael, when contending with the devil and disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce a reviling judgment against him, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

(Jude 1:10) 
But these men blaspheme all that they do not understand, and what they know instinctively by natural instinct, like unreasoning animals, these things only corrupt them.

(Jude 1:11) 
Woe to them! For they have walked in the path of Cain, and for profit they have plunged headlong into the error of Balaam, and they have perished in the rebellion of Korah.

(Jude 1:12) 
These men are hidden reefs and blemishes at your sacred love feasts, feasting with you without fear, caring only for themselves. They are like clouds without water, carried along by winds; they are autumn trees without fruit, twice dead and completely uprooted.

(Jude 1:13) 
They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; they are wandering stars for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

(Jude 1:14) 
It was also about these very men that Enoch, the seventh in line from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of His holy ones, the angels and saints, to execute judgment,"

(Jude 1:15) 
...to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of their ungodly acts which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.

(Jude 1:16) 
These men are grumblers, faultfinders, following their own evil desires. Their mouths utter arrogant boasts, and they flatter people for the sake of personal gain.

(Jude 1:17) 
But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken beforehand by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(Jude 1:18) 
For they used to say to you that in the last times there will be scoffers, who will walk according to their own ungodly desires.

(Jude 1:19) 
These are the ones who cause divisions and separate themselves, being merely natural men, not possessing the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:20) 
But you, beloved, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.

(Jude 1:21) 
Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ which leads to eternal life.

(Jude 1:22) 
And for some, those who are already clearly in error, bring them to account and reprove them sharply;

(Jude 1:23) 
...but others, snatch out of the fire and save them; and on others, have mercy, but with caution, hating even the clothes that have been stained by their sinful flesh.

(Jude 1:24) 
Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless, with exceeding joy, before the presence of His glory—

(Jude 1:25) 
...to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and for all ages. Amen.
