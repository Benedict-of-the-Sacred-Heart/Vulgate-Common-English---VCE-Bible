(Hebrews 1:1) 
In many and various ways, God spoke in times past to our fathers through the Prophets.

(Hebrews 1:2) 
But in these last days, He has spoken to us through the Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He also created the ages and the universe.

(Hebrews 1:3) 
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory, and the exact representation of His very being. He sustains all things by His powerful Word. After He had made purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Divine Majesty on high.

(Hebrews 1:4) 
He became so much superior to the angels, just as the Name He inherited is more excellent than theirs.

(Hebrews 1:5) 
For to which of the angels did God ever say: 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You'? And again: 'I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to Me'?

(Hebrews 1:6) 
And when God again introduces the Firstborn into the world, He says: 'And let all the angels of God worship Him'.

(Hebrews 1:7) 
And concerning the angels, indeed, He says: 'Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire'.

(Hebrews 1:8) 
But to the Son He says: 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. Your rule is perfectly just'.

(Hebrews 1:9) 
You have loved justice and hated iniquity. Therefore, God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

(Hebrews 1:10) 
And: 'You, O Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the universe is the work of Your hands'.

(Hebrews 1:11) 
They will perish, but You remain. And they will all grow old like a garment.

(Hebrews 1:12) 
Like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not come to an end.

(Hebrews 1:13) 
But to which of the angels has God ever said: 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet'?

(Hebrews 1:14) 
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth on a mission to serve on behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?

(Hebrews 2:1) 
Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to the truths we have heard, so that we do not drift away from God’s truth.

(Hebrews 2:2) 
For if the Old Law, which was spoken to us through angels, was established as true and firm, and every transgression and act of disobedience to that Law received a just and deserved punishment,

(Hebrews 2:3) 
how shall we escape God’s judgment if we neglect this great salvation? This salvation was first announced directly by the Lord Himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who personally heard Him speak.

(Hebrews 2:4) 
God also bore witness to this salvation through signs, wonders, and various powerful miracles, along with distributions of the Holy Spirit’s gifts, all according to His own divine will.

(Hebrews 2:5) 
For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, the new order of creation that we are now speaking about.

(Hebrews 2:6) 
However, someone once testified in Scripture, saying: 'What is man, that You are mindful of him? Or the son of man, that You visit him?'

(Hebrews 2:7) 
You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor, and You appointed him over all the works of Your hands.

(Hebrews 2:8) 
You put all things under his feet.' Indeed, by subjecting all things to him, God left nothing that is not subject to man. However, right now, we do not yet see all things fully subjected to man in the world.

(Hebrews 2:9) 
But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels—we see Him crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of His death. He suffered death for every single person, so that through this experience, He might be made fully suitable and perfect to be our merciful High Priest.

(Hebrews 2:10) 
For it was entirely fitting that God the Father—for Whom and through Whom all things exist—in bringing many sons and daughters into His glory, would make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.

(Hebrews 2:11) 
For both He who makes holy (Jesus Christ) and those who are made holy (the faithful) are all from one Father. For this reason, Christ is not ashamed to call them His brothers and sisters, saying:

(Hebrews 2:12) 
'I will proclaim Your Name to My brothers and sisters. In the midst of the assembled Church, I will sing Your praises.'

(Hebrews 2:13) 
And again He says, 'I will put My trust completely in Him.' And again, 'Here I am, with the children God has given Me.'

(Hebrews 2:14) 
Since these children of God share a common human nature of flesh and blood, Jesus Himself likewise fully partook in that very same nature. He did this so that through His own death, He might destroy the one who holds the dominion of death, which is the devil,

(Hebrews 2:15) 
and so that He might free all those who, throughout their entire lives, were held in bondage by the constant fear of death.

(Hebrews 2:16) 
For He certainly did not come to the aid of angels, nor did He take on their nature; rather, He took on the nature of humanity, specifically, the descendants of Abraham.

(Hebrews 2:17) 
Therefore, it was necessary for Him to be made like His brothers and sisters in every single way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in service to God. Through this, He would make atonement and propitiation for the sins of His people.

(Hebrews 2:18) 
For because He Himself suffered and was tempted, He is now powerfully able to come to the aid of those who are also being tempted.

(Hebrews 3:1) 
Therefore, my holy brothers and sisters, you who share in a heavenly calling, focus your attention on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our faith.

(Hebrews 3:2) 
He is faithful to God, who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all of God's own household.

(Hebrews 3:3) 
For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.

(Hebrews 3:4) 
For every house is built by someone, but the One who built all things is God.

(Hebrews 3:5) 
And Moses was certainly faithful in all of God's household as a servant, testifying to the things that would be revealed later.

(Hebrews 3:6) 
But Christ is faithful as a Son presiding over His own household. We are that household, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the glorious boast of our hope until the very end.

(Hebrews 3:7) 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: 'Today, if you hear His voice,

(Hebrews 3:8) 
do not harden your hearts, just as during the provocation on the day of testing in the wilderness,

(Hebrews 3:9) 
where your ancestors tested My patience and proved My power, even though they saw My works for forty years.

(Hebrews 3:10) 
That is why I was greatly provoked with that generation, and I declared: 'These people always go astray in their hearts. Indeed, they have not known My ways,' 

(Hebrews 3:11) 
just as I swore in My anger, 'They shall never enter into My rest.''

(Hebrews 3:12) 
Be careful, brothers and sisters, that none of you should ever have an evil, unbelieving heart that would lead you to fall away from the living God.

(Hebrews 3:13) 
Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is still called 'Today,' so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

(Hebrews 3:14) 
For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold firmly to the very foundation of our confidence in Him until the end.

(Hebrews 3:15) 
As it is said, 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts just as in that ancient provocation.'

(Hebrews 3:16) 
For some, when they heard God's voice, rebelled against Him. However, not everyone who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses rebelled.

(Hebrews 3:17) 
And with whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies lay dead and scattered in the wilderness?

(Hebrews 3:18) 
And to whom did God swear that they would not enter into His rest, if not to those who were unbelieving?

(Hebrews 3:19) 
So we see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:1) 
Therefore, let us be seriously concerned and afraid that, even though the promise of entering into God's eternal rest is still available, some among you may be considered to have failed to enter it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:2) 
For indeed, the Good News was preached to us, just as it was to that earlier generation in the desert. But the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in the hearts of those who heard it.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:3) 
For we who have believed are truly entering into God's rest, just as God said concerning the disobedient generation of Israel: 'As I swore in My wrath, they shall certainly not enter into My rest.' And yet, God's works, the finished creation of the universe and the earth, were completed from the very moment the world was founded, meaning the rest was always prepared.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:4) 
For God spoke in a specific passage concerning the seventh day, saying exactly this: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:5) 
And again, in that same passage, God emphasizes the condition: 'They shall certainly not enter into My rest.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:6) 
Since, therefore, it still remains for some people to enter into that eternal rest, and since those to whom the Good News was first proclaimed did not enter because of their deep-seated unbelief and disobedience,

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:7) 
God again defines a specific time for entry, emphasizing it as 'Today,' speaking through the Psalms of David after such a long period of time. Just as it was said earlier: 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.'

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:8) 
For if Joshua, who led the Israelites, had given them the *true* rest—the ultimate and perfect rest God intended—God would never have spoken of another 'today' or another time of rest after that.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:9) 
Therefore, a true and spiritual Sabbath rest, a participation in God's eternal peace and completion, remains for the people of God.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:10) 
For whoever has entered into God's rest has also ceased from his own works and efforts to earn salvation, just as God ceased from His works of creation after they were finished.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:11) 
Let us therefore make every effort and hasten to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same example of stubborn unbelief and disobedience shown by the ancient Israelites.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:12) 
For the Word of God is alive and actively working. It is more piercing and decisive than any two-edged sword, and it reaches even to the deepest separation of soul and spirit, even to the joints and the marrow, fully discerning and judging the hidden thoughts and true intentions of the human heart.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:13) 
And there is no creature, no part of creation, that is invisible or hidden from His sight. Indeed, all things are laid bare and are completely open before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:14) 
Therefore, since we have such a great High Priest who has passed through the created cosmos and ascended into the presence of God Himself—Jesus, the Son of God—let us hold firmly to our confession of faith in Him.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:15) 
For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize with our human weaknesses and sufferings. Rather, we have One who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without committing any sin.

(Hebrews 4:Hebrews 4:16) 
Therefore, let us approach with bold confidence to the throne of God's grace, so that we may receive His divine mercy and find His grace to help us precisely when it is most needed.

(Hebrews 5:1) 
Every high priest, taken from among men, is appointed to act on behalf of humanity in matters that pertain to God. His role is to offer up gifts and make sacrifices to atone for sins.

(Hebrews 5:2) 
Because he himself is subject to human weakness, he is able to feel compassion for those who act ignorantly and who make mistakes.

(Hebrews 5:3) 
And because of this weakness, he must offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 5:4) 
And no one presumes to take this high priestly honor upon himself, but only he who is called by God to do so, just as Aaron was.

(Hebrews 5:5) 
In the same way, God the Son did not appoint Himself to be the High Priest, nor did He glorify Himself in this role. Rather, it was God the Father who spoke to Him, declaring: 'You are My Son, and today I have begotten You.'

(Hebrews 5:6) 
Just as He also says in another passage: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 5:7) 
During His time on Earth as a man, God the Son offered up prayers and urgent appeals, with fervent cries and tears, to God the Father, who had the power to save Him from the finality of death. And He was heard and received in His reverence and devotion.

(Hebrews 5:8) 
And although He was already the Son of God, He learned the full meaning and depth of obedience through the sufferings He endured.

(Hebrews 5:9) 
And being made perfect in His human nature through these sufferings, He became the ultimate source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.

(Hebrews 5:10) 
Thus, He was appointed by God to be a High Priest, in the same sacred line and according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 5:11) 
Concerning this, we have much to say, but it is difficult for us to explain it to you, because you have become spiritually slow and dull of hearing.

(Hebrews 5:12) 
For even though by now, given the time that has passed, you ought to be teaching others, instead you still need someone to teach you again the basic, foundational truths of God's teachings. You have become like infants who require milk, not solid spiritual nourishment.

(Hebrews 5:13) 
For everyone who continues to subsist on milk alone is inexperienced in the deeper teachings of righteousness, because he is still a spiritual child.

(Hebrews 5:14) 
But solid spiritual food is meant for those who are mature and have achieved spiritual perfection. These are the ones who, through consistent practice and experience, have trained their spiritual faculties to discern between what is truly good and what is evil.

(Hebrews 6:6:1) 
Therefore, let us leave behind the basic, initial teachings about Christ. We should move on to a more complete and mature understanding, not laying again the foundation of repentance from spiritually dead works and foundational faith in God,

(Hebrews 6:6:2) 
This foundation includes teachings about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the final eternal judgment.

(Hebrews 6:6:3) 
And we will do this—that is, move on to maturity—if God permits us.

(Hebrews 6:6:4) 
Indeed, it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift of divine grace, and who became sharers in the Holy Spirit,

(Hebrews 6:6:5) 
and who tasted the goodness of God's revealed doctrine, and experienced the miraculous powers of the age to come—

(Hebrews 6:6:6) 
if they then fell away from the faith. It is impossible to renew them again for repentance, because by their actions, they crucify the Son of God again for themselves and hold Him up to public shame.

(Hebrews 6:6:7) 
For the land that drinks in the rain that often falls upon it, and then produces useful vegetation for those who cultivate it, receives a blessing from God.

(Hebrews 6:6:8) 
But the land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and is near to being cursed. Its ultimate end is to be burned.

(Hebrews 6:6:9) 
But concerning you, beloved ones, we are confident of better things—things that lead to salvation—even though we speak this way with warnings.

(Hebrews 6:6:10) 
For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have shown for His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and continue to minister to them.

(Hebrews 6:6:11) 
But we earnestly desire that each one of you show the same diligence and care, so that your hope may be fully realized right up to the very end.

(Hebrews 6:6:12) 
This is so that you do not become sluggish, but rather become imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises of God.

(Hebrews 6:6:13) 
For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater by whom to swear, He swore by Himself,

(Hebrews 6:6:14) 
saying, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your descendants."

(Hebrews 6:6:15) 
And so, by patiently enduring, Abraham received the promise.

(Hebrews 6:6:16) 
For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath serves as the final confirmation for all their disputes, settling the matter.

(Hebrews 6:6:17) 
In the same way, God, desiring to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath.

(Hebrews 6:6:18) 
This was so that by two unchangeable things—namely, His promise and His oath—in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have a very strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.

(Hebrews 6:6:19) 
This hope we have as a sure and steadfast anchor for our soul, which penetrates beyond the veil into the Most Holy Place,

(Hebrews 6:6:20) 
where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:1) 
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and a priest of the Most High God, was the one who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.

(Hebrews 7:7:2) 
Abraham then gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name, 'Melchizedek,' is interpreted as 'King of Righteousness.' And then, his title, 'King of Salem,' means 'King of Peace.'

(Hebrews 7:7:3) 
He is recorded as having no father, no mother, and no earthly genealogy. He has no recorded beginning of days, nor any end of life. He is thus likened to the Son of God, and in this way, he remains a priest forever.

(Hebrews 7:7:4) 
Now, consider how great this man was, for Abraham, who was himself the great patriarch, gave this Melchizedek a tenth of all the choicest spoils he had taken in battle.

(Hebrews 7:7:5) 
And truly, those priests who are descended from Levi's sons have a divine command to collect a tenth of all property from the people, according to the Law given by God. This means they collect from their own brethren, the other Israelites, even though these brethren also descended from Abraham's lineage.

(Hebrews 7:7:6) 
But Melchizedek, whose genealogy is not counted among the Levites, received tithes from Abraham. And this priest, who had the divine promises bestowed upon him, then blessed Abraham.

(Hebrews 7:7:7) 
Now, it is beyond any dispute and universally acknowledged that the person who is of a lesser status is always blessed by the person who is of a greater status.

(Hebrews 7:7:8) 
In the case of the Levitical priesthood, tithes are collected by mere mortal men, who are destined to die. But in the case of Melchizedek, the Scripture attests that he lives, and his priesthood has no end.

(Hebrews 7:7:9) 
And it could even be said, in a symbolic sense, that through Abraham, even Levi—who later became the ancestor of the very priests who collect tithes—was himself tithed by Melchizedek.

(Hebrews 7:7:10) 
For Levi was still present in the loins of his ancestor, Abraham, when Melchizedek met Abraham and received the tithes.

(Hebrews 7:7:11) 
Therefore, if spiritual perfection could have been achieved through the Levitical priesthood, what further need was there for God to raise up another priest, one described as being 'according to the order of Melchizedek'? And why would he not be called 'according to the order of Aaron'?

(Hebrews 7:7:12) 
For when there is a change in the established priesthood, it is necessary that a change in the entire Law also takes place.

(Hebrews 7:7:13) 
For the one about whom these things are said, that is, Christ, belongs to a completely different tribe of Israel, one from which no one has ever served as a priest at the altar of God.

(Hebrews 7:7:14) 
For it is perfectly clear and well-known that our Lord Jesus Christ was born from the tribe of Judah, and regarding this tribe, Moses said nothing at all concerning their right to have priests.

(Hebrews 7:7:15) 
And it becomes even more abundantly clear that this new priesthood is necessary if another priest arises, one who is specifically 'according to the likeness of Melchizedek'.

(Hebrews 7:7:16) 
This new priest has become such, not by virtue of a merely human, fleshly law, like the Levitical priests, but by the indestructible power of an unending life.

(Hebrews 7:7:17) 
For indeed, the Scripture bears witness, saying to the Son of God: 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'

(Hebrews 7:7:18) 
Thus, the former commandment, which established the Levitical priesthood, is set aside and invalidated. This is done because that old commandment was weak and ultimately useless to bring about salvation.

(Hebrews 7:7:19) 
For the Law, in itself, could not make anyone perfectly righteous or fully reconcile them with God. But now, through the New Covenant, we have been given the introduction of a far better hope, and by this hope, we are able to draw near to God with confidence.

(Hebrews 7:7:20) 
This new High Priesthood was not established without a solemn oath from God Himself.

(Hebrews 7:7:21) 
For the Levitical priests were made priests without any oath from God, but our High Priest, Christ, was made priest with an oath directly from God, as God Himself declared to Him: 'The Lord has sworn an unbreakable oath and will not change His mind: "You are a priest forever."'

(Hebrews 7:7:22) 
By virtue of this solemn divine oath, Jesus has become the very guarantee and surety of a vastly superior covenant between God and man.

(Hebrews 7:7:23) 
The Levitical priests became numerous, one after another, precisely because they were all mortal and were prevented by death from remaining in their office permanently.

(Hebrews 7:7:24) 
But Jesus, because He lives and remains in His priesthood forever, possesses an unchangeable, permanent, and continuous priesthood.

(Hebrews 7:7:25) 
Therefore, He is also perfectly able to save for all eternity those who approach God the Father through Him, Jesus Christ. He is always living in heaven for the specific purpose of interceding before the Father on our behalf.

(Hebrews 7:7:26) 
For indeed, such a high priest was perfectly suited and necessary for us: one who is holy, innocent, and completely undefiled by sin, one who is set apart from sinners, and who has been exalted to a position higher than all the created skies and celestial realms.

(Hebrews 7:7:27) 
He has no need, as the Old Covenant priests did daily, to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and only then for the sins of the people.

(Hebrews 7:7:28) 
For Christ accomplished this definitive act of atonement once and for all when He offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 8:1) 
The main point of everything we are saying is this: We have such a High Priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens —meaning He is in charge of all things,

(Hebrews 8:2) 
and He serves in the true holy places, in the true tabernacle —the actual dwelling place of God, which the Lord Himself established, not any human being.

(Hebrews 8:3) 
For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it was necessary for Christ, our High Priest, to also have something to offer.

(Hebrews 8:4) 
If He were on Earth, He wouldn't even be a priest at all, because there are already priests who offer gifts according to the Law of Moses.

(Hebrews 8:5) 
These earthly priests serve only as a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities. This is just as God instructed Moses when he was about to build the earthly tabernacle: He said, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain” —referring to the divine blueprint God gave Moses.

(Hebrews 8:6) 
But now, Christ has obtained a much more excellent ministry, because He is the Mediator of a better covenant —a new agreement between God and humanity, which has been legally established on better promises.

(Hebrews 8:7) 
For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no reason to seek a second one.

(Hebrews 8:8) 
For God Himself found fault with them, saying through the prophet Jeremiah: “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;

(Hebrews 8:9) 
It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not remain faithful to My covenant, and so I turned away from them, declares the Lord.

(Hebrews 8:10) 
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

(Hebrews 8:11) 
And no one will have to teach his neighbor, or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because all of them will know Me, from the least to the greatest” —meaning all will have direct knowledge of God.

(Hebrews 8:12) 
For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.”

(Hebrews 8:13) 
By speaking of a “new” covenant, God has made the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and aging is about to vanish completely.

(Hebrews 9:1) 
Indeed, the first covenant itself had its ordinances of worship, by which they would be made ritually right, and it had a sanctuary which was of this world, built on earth.

(Hebrews 9:2) 
For a tabernacle was set up, the first part. In this part were the lampstands, and the table, and the showbread. This first part is called the Holy Place.

(Hebrews 9:3) 
But behind the second veil was the second part of the tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies.

(Hebrews 9:4) 
This part contained a golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered on all sides with gold. Inside the Ark was a golden urn holding manna, and Aaron's rod which had miraculously budded, and the stone tablets on which the covenant was written.

(Hebrews 9:5) 
Above the Ark were the Cherubim of Glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. Now, it is not possible to speak in detail about each of these things.

(Hebrews 9:6) 
With all these things arranged in this way, the priests regularly entered the first part of the tabernacle. There, they performed the acts of worship and completed the sacrificial duties.

(Hebrews 9:7) 
But into the second part, the Holy of Holies, only the high priest entered, and only once a year. He never entered without blood, which he would offer for his own sins and for the sins committed by the people out of ignorance.

(Hebrews 9:8) 
By these arrangements, the Holy Spirit was indicating that the way into God's true holy presence was not yet fully opened to humanity, as long as the first, earthly tabernacle was still standing and operational.

(Hebrews 9:9) 
This earthly tabernacle is a symbol for the present time, a time in which gifts and sacrifices are still being offered that cannot, in good conscience, make the worshipper truly perfect before God.

(Hebrews 9:10) 
These rituals are only about external things: foods, drinks, various ceremonial washings, and other outward regulations for the flesh, all of which were imposed only until the time when God would establish a new, better order.

(Hebrews 9:11) 
But Christ has now come forward as the High Priest of the good things that were to come. He ministers through a tabernacle that is much greater and more perfect, one not made by human hands; that is to say, it is not part of this created world.

(Hebrews 9:12) 
He did not enter by the blood of goats or young bulls, as the earthly high priest did. Instead, He entered the true heavenly Holy of Holies once for all time, by His own precious blood, having secured eternal redemption for us.

(Hebrews 9:13) 
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ritually defiled, can make them outwardly holy for the cleansing of the flesh,

(Hebrews 9:14) 
then how much more powerfully will the blood of Christ cleanse our consciences from dead works! Christ, through the eternal Holy Spirit, offered Himself as a spotless sacrifice to God. His sacrifice purifies us so that we may truly serve the living God.

(Hebrews 9:15) 
And for this reason, Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant. His death has occurred as a ransom for the transgressions committed under the first covenant. This means that those who have been called by God can now receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.

(Hebrews 9:16) 
For where there is a testament—a will—it is absolutely necessary that the death of the one who made the will, the testator, has occurred for it to be valid.

(Hebrews 9:17) 
A will is only confirmed and becomes legally binding once the person who made it has died. Otherwise, it is not yet valid as long as the testator is still alive.

(Hebrews 9:18) 
This is why even the first covenant was not dedicated and made official without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:19) 
For after Moses had read every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, mixed it with water, and used scarlet wool and hyssop to sprinkle the book of the Law itself and all the people.

(Hebrews 9:20) 
He declared, 'This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you, marking His solemn agreement with you.'

(Hebrews 9:21) 
In the same way, Moses also sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels used for its service with blood.

(Hebrews 9:22) 
Indeed, according to the Law, almost everything is cleansed with blood, and there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.

(Hebrews 9:23) 
Therefore, it was necessary for the earthly copies of the heavenly realities to be cleansed with these kinds of animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly realities themselves had to be purified with far better sacrifices than these.

(Hebrews 9:24) 
For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by human hands, which is merely a copy of the true one. Instead, He entered into the universe itself, the true dwelling place of God, to appear now directly before the face of God on our behalf.

(Hebrews 9:25) 
Nor did Christ need to offer Himself repeatedly, as the earthly high priest enters the Holy of Holies year after year with blood that is not his own.

(Hebrews 9:26) 
If that were the case, then He would have had to suffer many times since the very beginning of the world. But instead, He has appeared only once, at the culmination of all ages, to put an end to sin definitively through His own sacrifice.

(Hebrews 9:27) 
And just as it is appointed for all human beings to die once, and after that comes the judgment,

(Hebrews 9:28) 
so also Christ was offered once to bear away the sins of many people. He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring full salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

(Hebrews 10:1) 
The Law of Moses was only a shadow of the good things that were to come, not the real and perfect substance of those things. Because of this, it could never make perfect those who constantly approached God through the same animal sacrifices offered year after year.

(Hebrews 10:2) 
If those sacrifices could have made people perfect, they would have stopped being offered. Because then, those who had been truly cleansed through that worship would no longer have been conscious of their sins.

(Hebrews 10:3) 
Instead, those sacrifices served as a reminder of sins every single year.

(Hebrews 10:4) 
This is because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to actually take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:5) 
This is why, when Jesus Christ came into the world, He said: 'You, O God, did not want the animal sacrifices and grain offerings from the Old Covenant. Instead, you specifically prepared a human body for me to offer.'

(Hebrews 10:6) 
'You were not pleased with the burnt offerings and sin offerings, because they could not truly remove sin.'

(Hebrews 10:7) 
'Then I, Jesus Christ, said: See, I have come! As it is written about Me in the scroll of the Law, I have come to do Your will, O God.'

(Hebrews 10:8) 
First, He said: 'You did not desire, nor were You pleased with, the sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings, which were offered according to the Law of Moses.'

(Hebrews 10:9) 
Then He added: 'See, I have come to do Your will, O God.' By saying this, He sets aside the old system of animal sacrifices in order to establish the new, perfect sacrifice of His own body.

(Hebrews 10:10) 
And it is by this specific will of God, fully accomplished by Jesus Christ, that we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.

(Hebrews 10:11) 
Indeed, every Old Covenant priest stands day after day performing his duties, repeatedly offering the same sacrifices, none of which can ever truly take away sins.

(Hebrews 10:12) 
But Jesus Christ, having offered one single sacrifice for sins that is perfect for all time, now sits forever at the right hand of God the Father in heaven.

(Hebrews 10:13) 
From that moment on, He waits until all His enemies are utterly subjected to Him, like a footstool under His feet.

(Hebrews 10:14) 
For by that one offering, He has permanently perfected and brought to their full spiritual end those who are being sanctified.

(Hebrews 10:15) 
The Holy Spirit Himself also confirms this truth to us; for after He (speaking through the Prophet Jeremiah) had declared:

(Hebrews 10:16) 
'This is the New Covenant I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord. 'I will put My divine laws into their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds.'

(Hebrews 10:17) 
'And I will no longer remember their sins and their lawless deeds.'

(Hebrews 10:18) 
Now, where there is this full and complete forgiveness of sins, there is no longer any need for a sacrifice for sin.

(Hebrews 10:19) 
Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, since we have confident access into the most holy presence of God, through the blood of Jesus Christ,

(Hebrews 10:20) 
through the new and living way that He opened for us. This way passes through the veil, which is to say, through His own physical body, broken on the Cross.

(Hebrews 10:21) 
And since we have Jesus Christ as our great High Priest, who presides over the spiritual house of God—the Church—

(Hebrews 10:22) 
let us draw near to God with sincere hearts, having full assurance of faith. Our hearts have been spiritually cleansed from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with the pure water of baptism.

(Hebrews 10:23) 
Let us hold firmly and without wavering to the profession of our Christian hope, because God, who has promised these things, is utterly faithful and will fulfill them.

(Hebrews 10:24) 
And let us consider how we can stir up one another to love and to good works of charity,

(Hebrews 10:25) 
not neglecting our communal gathering for worship, as some have made it their habit to do. Instead, let us encourage one another in our faith, and do this all the more as you see the Day of the Lord’s return drawing near.

(Hebrews 10:26) 
For if we deliberately and willfully continue to sin, after we have received and understood the full knowledge of the truth of Christ, then there no longer remains any other sacrifice that can atone for our sin.

(Hebrews 10:27) 
Instead, there remains only a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of an all-consuming fire that will justly devour those who oppose God.

(Hebrews 10:28) 
Anyone who rejected or nullified the Law of Moses was put to death without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.

(Hebrews 10:29) 
How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the person who has trampled underfoot the Son of God Himself? This person has treated as unholy the very blood of the New Covenant—the blood by which they were sanctified—and has grievously insulted the Holy Spirit of grace.

(Hebrews 10:30) 
For we know Him who said: 'Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay those who deserve it.' And again: 'The Lord will indeed judge His own people.'

(Hebrews 10:31) 
It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who will execute perfect justice.

(Hebrews 10:32) 
Remember the early days of your conversion, after you received the spiritual light of Christ. You endured a great struggle filled with suffering and persecution.

(Hebrews 10:33) 
Sometimes you were publicly exposed to shame and persecution, made a spectacle before others. At other times, you became sympathetic companions of those who were suffering such things.

(Hebrews 10:34) 
Indeed, you showed compassion to those who were imprisoned, and you cheerfully accepted the seizure of your own possessions. This was because you knew that you yourselves possessed a far better and an eternally enduring spiritual wealth.

(Hebrews 10:35) 
So then, do not throw away your courageous confidence in Christ, which is accompanied by a great and lasting reward.

(Hebrews 10:36) 
For you need to persevere with steadfast patience. Only by faithfully doing the will of God will you receive the fulfillment of His promises.

(Hebrews 10:37) 
For 'in a very little while now, He who is coming will come, and He will not delay!'

(Hebrews 10:38) 
'Now, my righteous one will live by faith.' But the Scripture also warns: 'If anyone shrinks back from this faith, My soul—God Himself—will take no pleasure in him.'

(Hebrews 10:39) 
But we are not those who shrink back from faith and are destined for perdition and eternal loss. Instead, we are those who hold fast to faith, leading to the preservation and eternal salvation of our souls.

(Hebrews 11:1) 
Now, faith is the actual, underlying reality of all that we hope for;
it is the conviction and proof of things we cannot yet see.

(Hebrews 11:2) 
For through this kind of faith, the holy people of ancient times received God's full approval.

(Hebrews 11:3) 
By faith we understand that the entire universe was perfectly ordered and made by God the Son’s spoken Word,
so that everything we can see was made from things that are invisible.

(Hebrews 11:4) 
By faith, Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice to God than Cain did.
Through this faith, he received God's approval as righteous, for God Himself bore witness to his offerings.
And even though he is long dead, through his faith, he still speaks to us.

(Hebrews 11:5) 
By faith, Enoch was taken away from this world so that he would not experience death;
he could not be found, because God had taken him.
Before he was taken, he had already received God’s approval, for he had pleased God.

(Hebrews 11:6) 
But without faith, it is impossible to please God.
For anyone who wishes to draw near to God must believe that He exists,
and that He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.

(Hebrews 11:7) 
By faith, Noah, after receiving a divine warning about things that were not yet visible (the coming flood),
was reverently moved and prepared an ark for the salvation of his household.
Through this act of faith, he condemned the faithless world around him
and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.

(Hebrews 11:8) 
By faith, Abraham, when he was called by God,
obeyed by going out to a place that he was later to receive as an inheritance;
he left his home not knowing where he was going, trusting only in God.

(Hebrews 11:9) 
By faith, he lived as a temporary resident in the land that had been promised to him, treating it as a foreign country.
He lived in tents, along with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs of the same divine promise.

(Hebrews 11:10) 
For Abraham was looking forward to the heavenly city that has firm foundations,
a city whose divine architect and builder is God Himself.

(Hebrews 11:11) 
By faith, even Sarah herself, though she was barren and past the age of childbearing,
received the divine power to conceive a child,
because she believed that the One who had given the promise was faithful.

(Hebrews 11:12) 
Therefore, from one man, who was as good as dead (due to his old age),
were born descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky
and as countless as the sand on the seashore.

(Hebrews 11:13) 
All these faithful people died in faith, without having received the full fulfillment of the promises themselves.
Instead, they saw and greeted them from afar,
and confessed that they were strangers and temporary residents on this earth.

(Hebrews 11:14) 
For those who speak in this manner plainly declare that they are seeking their true, heavenly homeland.

(Hebrews 11:15) 
And if they had indeed kept in mind the earthly country from which they departed,
they would have had plenty of opportunity to return to it.

(Hebrews 11:16) 
But as it is, they desired a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
for He has prepared a heavenly city for them.

(Hebrews 11:17) 
By faith, Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God tested him.
He, who had received the divine promises, was willing to offer his only son of the promise.

(Hebrews 11:18) 
It was about Isaac that God had said, 'It is through Isaac that your lineage of promised descendants will be named and established'.

(Hebrews 11:19) 
Abraham reasoned that God was powerful enough to raise Isaac even from the dead.
And indeed, from that event, he received Isaac back as a symbolic representation of a greater resurrection.

(Hebrews 11:20) 
By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, speaking prophetically about their future.

(Hebrews 11:21) 
By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons.
And he worshipped God, bowing down while leaning on the top of his staff.

(Hebrews 11:22) 
By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the future departure of the children of Israel from Egypt,
and he gave specific instructions concerning his bones.

(Hebrews 11:23) 
By faith, when Moses was born, he was hidden for three months by his parents,
because they saw that he was an exceptionally beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's cruel edict to kill all male infants.

(Hebrews 11:24) 
By faith, Moses, when he had grown to adulthood, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

(Hebrews 11:25) 
choosing instead to suffer affliction with the people of God,
rather than to enjoy the fleeting and temporary pleasures of sin.

(Hebrews 11:26) 
He considered the suffering and disgrace endured for the sake of the Messiah to be far greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt,
for he was looking forward to God's eternal reward.

(Hebrews 11:27) 
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the fierce wrath of the king.
For he persevered, seeing the invisible God as clearly as if He were visible.

(Hebrews 11:28) 
By faith, he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of blood,
so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the children of Israel.

(Hebrews 11:29) 
By faith, the Israelites passed through the Red Sea as if on dry ground.
But when the Egyptians attempted to do the same, they were swallowed up and drowned.

(Hebrews 11:30) 
By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.

(Hebrews 11:31) 
By faith, Rahab, who had been a harlot, did not perish with those who disobeyed God,
because she welcomed the Israelite spies in peace.

(Hebrews 11:32) 
And what more shall I say?
For I do not have enough time to tell of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.

(Hebrews 11:33) 
Through faith, these men conquered kingdoms, administered true justice, obtained divine promises,
and stopped the mouths of lions.

(Hebrews 11:34) 
They quenched the power of fiery attacks, escaped the sharp edge of the sword,
recovered from severe illness and weakness, became valiant in battle, and routed the invading armies of foreigners.

(Hebrews 11:35) 
Women received their dead loved ones back to life through a resurrection.
But others were tortured, refusing to accept release or deliverance from their suffering,
in order that they might attain a better resurrection unto eternal life.

(Hebrews 11:36) 
Still others endured severe ridicule and painful flogging,
and even suffered chains and imprisonment.

(Hebrews 11:37) 
They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they faced extreme trials and temptations, they were put to death by the sword.
They wandered about in garments of animal skins, being destitute, persecuted, and cruelly treated.

(Hebrews 11:38) 
The world was not worthy of these faithful ones.
They wandered in deserts and mountains, and lived in dens and caves of the earth.

(Hebrews 11:39) 
And all these, though they obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not receive the full ultimate promise of God.

(Hebrews 11:40) 
This was because God had foreseen something even better for us, the New Covenant,
so that they would not be made perfect or reach their ultimate fulfillment without us.

(Hebrews 12:12:1) 
Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of Saints as witnesses surrounding us, let us put aside every burden and every sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the struggle that is set before us.

(Hebrews 12:12:2) 
Let us look to Jesus, the One who authored and perfected our faith. For the joy that was set before Him, He patiently endured the cross, despising its shame, and He now sits at the right hand of God's throne.

(Hebrews 12:12:3) 
For consider Jesus, who endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, so that you do not grow weary and lose heart in your souls.

(Hebrews 12:12:4) 
For in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood for the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:5) 
And you have forgotten the exhortation that speaks to you as God's children, saying: "My child, do not neglect the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when you are corrected by Him."

(Hebrews 12:12:6) 
For the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He scourges every child whom He accepts as His own.

(Hebrews 12:12:7) 
Endure with discipline. God is dealing with you as His true children, for what child is there whom a father does not correct and train?

(Hebrews 12:12:8) 
But if you are without discipline—which all legitimate children of God share in—then you are illegitimate and not true children.

(Hebrews 12:12:9) 
Furthermore, we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us. Should we not much more readily submit to the Father of our spirits and truly live and be saved?

(Hebrews 12:12:10) 
For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a short time, according to what they thought best. But God disciplines us for our ultimate good, so that we may partake in His divine holiness and become Saints.

(Hebrews 12:12:11) 
Now, all discipline, while it is happening, seems to bring sorrow rather than joy. But afterwards, for those who have been trained by it, it yields the most peaceful fruit of true righteousness and justice.

(Hebrews 12:12:12) 
Therefore, strengthen your drooping hands and feeble knees,

(Hebrews 12:12:13) 
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed and strengthened.

(Hebrews 12:12:14) 
Pursue peace with all people, and pursue holiness, for without holiness no one will see God.

(Hebrews 12:12:15) 
Look diligently to it that no one fails to obtain God's grace, and that no root of bitterness springs up to cause trouble, by which many are defiled and turned away from the Faith.

(Hebrews 12:12:16) 
See to it that no one is sexually immoral or profane, like Esau, who for a single meal sold his divine birthright as the firstborn.

(Hebrews 12:12:17) 
For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He found no opportunity for true repentance, even though he sought it diligently with tears.

(Hebrews 12:12:18) 
For you have not come to a tangible mountain, Mount Sinai, that could be touched—a mountain blazing with fire, surrounded by a whirlwind, darkness, and storm,

(Hebrews 12:12:19) 
nor to the sound of a trumpet, nor to a voice speaking words so terrifying that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them.

(Hebrews 12:12:20) 
For they could not endure the command that was given: "If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."

(Hebrews 12:12:21) 
So terrifying was that sight that even Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."

(Hebrews 12:12:22) 
But you have come instead to Mount Sion, to the city of the living God, which is the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

(Hebrews 12:12:23) 
and to the Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in the heavenly registry, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect,

(Hebrews 12:12:24) 
and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks a better word than the blood of Abel, which cries out for vengeance.

(Hebrews 12:12:25) 
See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if those who refused Him who spoke on Earth, the Law through Moses, did not escape punishment, how much less shall we escape if we turn away from Him who speaks to us from the heavens, Jesus Christ!

(Hebrews 12:12:26) 
His voice then shook the Earth at Sinai, but now He has promised, saying: "Yet once more, I will shake not only the Earth, but also the entire created universe."

(Hebrews 12:12:27) 
Now, this phrase "Yet once more" signifies the removal of created things that can be shaken, so that those things that cannot be shaken may remain and stand firm forever.

(Hebrews 12:12:28) 
Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable Kingdom, let us be grateful, and by this gratitude, let us serve God acceptably with reverence and awe.

(Hebrews 12:12:29) 
For our God is a consuming fire, a refining fire that purifies His Saints and destroys His enemies.

(Hebrews 13:13:1) 
Let the love of your fellow Christians remain in your hearts.

(Hebrews 13:13:2) 
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers. Through this practice, some people have unknowingly given shelter to angels.

(Hebrews 13:13:3) 
Remember those who are imprisoned for their faith, as if you yourselves were chained with them. Also, remember those who are suffering, as if you yourselves were experiencing the same physical hardships.

(Hebrews 13:13:4) 
Let marriage be held in honor by all people, and let the marriage bed remain undefiled by sin. For God will certainly judge those who engage in sexual immorality and adultery.

(Hebrews 13:13:5) 
Your way of life should be free from the sin of avarice. Be content with the material blessings you currently possess. For God Himself has promised us, saying: "I will never abandon you; nor will I ever desert you."

(Hebrews 13:13:6) 
So, with firm confidence, we can proclaim: "The Lord is my unfailing helper and protector. Therefore, I will not fear anything that any human being can do to harm me."

(Hebrews 13:13:7) 
Remember your spiritual leaders, the ones who first taught you the saving Word of God. Consider carefully the outcome of their way of life, how they persevered in faith until death, and imitate their unwavering faith in God.

(Hebrews 13:13:8) 
Jesus Christ is the same divine person always. He was the same yesterday, He is the same today, and He will remain the same for all eternity.

(Hebrews 13:13:9) 
Do not allow yourselves to be led astray by various and unfamiliar doctrines. It is far better for your heart to be strengthened and established by God's grace, rather than by rules concerning foods, which have proven useless to those who meticulously observed them.

(Hebrews 13:13:10) 
We Christians have a spiritual altar, from which to eat. Those who continue to serve in the Old Covenant tabernacle rituals have no right or power to partake of this new, perfect sacrifice.

(Hebrews 13:13:11) 
In the Old Covenant, the blood of certain animals was brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest to atone for sin. The bodies of those very animals were then burned completely outside the camp of Israel.

(Hebrews 13:13:12) 
For this reason, Jesus Himself, in order to sanctify His people through the shedding of His own precious blood, suffered and died outside the city gate of Jerusalem.

(Hebrews 13:13:13) 
Let us, therefore, courageously go forth from the old ways and join Him outside the camp, willingly bearing the same scorn and disgrace that He endured.

(Hebrews 13:13:14) 
For we do not possess a permanent earthly city or homeland in this present world. Instead, we are earnestly seeking the heavenly city and everlasting Kingdom that is yet to come.

(Hebrews 13:13:15) 
Therefore, through Jesus Christ, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise. This sacrifice is the spiritual fruit of our lips, which confess and glorify His holy Name.

(Hebrews 13:13:16) 
Moreover, do not forget to do good works for others and to share your material possessions with those in need. For God is truly pleased and propitiated by such sacrifices of charity.

(Hebrews 13:13:17) 
Obey your spiritual leaders and humbly submit to their authority. For they diligently watch over your immortal souls, knowing that they will one day have to give an account to God for their stewardship. Obey them so that they may carry out their duties with joy, and not with sorrowful groaning, for that would certainly not be beneficial for your spiritual welfare.

(Hebrews 13:13:18) 
Please pray for us, your spiritual guides. We are confident that we possess a good and clear conscience in all matters, as we earnestly desire to conduct ourselves honorably in every aspect of our lives.

(Hebrews 13:13:19) 
I especially implore you to pray for this specific intention: that I may be restored to your presence more quickly.

(Hebrews 13:13:20) 
Now, may God, the very source of all peace, who, through the precious blood of the eternal covenant, brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of His flock,

(Hebrews 13:13:21) 
may He perfectly equip and prepare you in every good work, enabling you to faithfully accomplish His divine will. May He accomplish within you, through Jesus Christ, that which is truly pleasing in His sight. To this same Jesus Christ be all glory and honor, for all ages, forever and ever. Amen.

(Hebrews 13:13:22) 
Now, brothers and sisters, I earnestly ask you to patiently receive this message of consolation and encouragement. For, indeed, I have written to you in a relatively brief manner.

(Hebrews 13:13:23) 
Understand that our brother Timothy has been released from his confinement. If he arrives quickly, I plan to visit you along with him.

(Hebrews 13:13:24) 
Extend my greetings to all your spiritual leaders, and to all the holy people in your community. The Christian believers here in Italy also send their greetings to you.

(Hebrews 13:13:25) 
May the grace of God be with all of you. Amen.
