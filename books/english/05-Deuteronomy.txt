(Deuteronomy 1:1) 
These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan River. They were in the wilderness, on the plain across from the Red Sea, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

(Deuteronomy 1:2) 
It was an eleven-day journey from Mount Horeb, by way of Mount Seir, to Kadesh-barnea.

(Deuteronomy 1:3) 
In the fortieth year after they left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel everything that the Lord had commanded him to tell them.

(Deuteronomy 1:4) 
This was after Moses had defeated Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who lived in Astaroth and Edrei.

(Deuteronomy 1:5) 
On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the Law, saying:

(Deuteronomy 1:6) 
“The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed on this mountain for long enough.

(Deuteronomy 1:7) 
Turn around now, and set out for the mountain country of the Amorites, and for all their neighboring lands—the plains, the highlands, the lowlands, the Negev, and the seacoast—all the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.

(Deuteronomy 1:8) 
See, I have given this land to you. Go in now and take possession of it, the land that the Lord swore to your fathers—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—that He would give to them and to their descendants after them.’

(Deuteronomy 1:9) 
“At that time, I spoke to you and said, ‘I cannot bear the burden of leading you by myself.

(Deuteronomy 1:10) 
The Lord your God has multiplied your numbers, and today you are as many as the stars in the sky.

(Deuteronomy 1:11) 
May the Lord God of your fathers increase your numbers a thousand times more, and bless you, just as He has promised you.

(Deuteronomy 1:12) 
I alone am not able to bear the burden of your affairs, your heavy load, and your disputes.

(Deuteronomy 1:13) 
Choose wise, discerning, and experienced men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’

(Deuteronomy 1:14) 
You answered me then, ‘What you propose to do is good.’

(Deuteronomy 1:15) 
So I took the wise and prominent men from your tribes and appointed them as leaders over you: commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and also officers for your tribes, to instruct you in all matters.

(Deuteronomy 1:16) 
I then commanded your judges, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your people, and judge fairly between a man and his brother, or between a man and a foreigner.

(Deuteronomy 1:17) 
You shall not show favoritism in judgment; you must hear both the small and the great equally, and you must not fear any man, for the judgment belongs to God. If any case is too difficult for you, you are to bring it to me, and I will hear it.’

(Deuteronomy 1:18) 
I commanded you at that time concerning all the things you were to do.

(Deuteronomy 1:19) 
So, after we left Horeb, we traveled through that vast and terrifying wilderness you yourselves saw, following the road to the mountain region of the Amorites, just as the Lord our God commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,

(Deuteronomy 1:20) 
I said to you, ‘You have now arrived at the mountain region of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving to us.

(Deuteronomy 1:21) 
Look, the Lord your God has given you this land. Go up and take possession of it, just as the Lord God of your fathers has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged by anything.’

(Deuteronomy 1:22) 
But all of you came near me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead to scout the land for us and bring back a report about the route we should take and the cities we will encounter.’

(Deuteronomy 1:23) 
This idea seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.

(Deuteronomy 1:24) 
They went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol, where they explored the land.

(Deuteronomy 1:25) 
They gathered some of the land’s fruit as proof of its richness and brought it back to us, saying, ‘The land the Lord our God is giving us is indeed good.’

(Deuteronomy 1:26) 
But you refused to go up, and instead you rebelled against the command of the Lord our God.

(Deuteronomy 1:27) 
You complained in your tents, saying, ‘The Lord must hate us! That is why He brought us out of the land of Egypt—to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.

(Deuteronomy 1:28) 
Where are we supposed to go? Our fellow Israelites have filled our hearts with fear by saying, “The people there are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls reaching to the sky! And we even saw the Anakim, the giants, there!”’

(Deuteronomy 1:29) 
Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified or afraid of them.

(Deuteronomy 1:30) 
The Lord your God, who goes before you, will Himself fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 1:31) 
And in the wilderness—where you yourselves saw—the Lord your God carried you, just as a father carries his son, all along the path you traveled until you reached this place.

(Deuteronomy 1:32) 
Yet, despite all this, you still did not believe in the Lord your God,

(Deuteronomy 1:33) 
who went ahead of you on your journey to find you a place to camp. He showed you the way to go by fire at night and by a pillar of cloud by day.

(Deuteronomy 1:34) 
When the Lord heard the sound of your complaints, He became angry and swore an oath, saying:

(Deuteronomy 1:35) 
‘Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,

(Deuteronomy 1:36) 
except for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. He alone shall see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has walked, because he has fully followed the Lord.’

(Deuteronomy 1:37) 
Because of you, the Lord also became angry with me and said, ‘Even you, Moses, shall not enter there.

(Deuteronomy 1:38) 
But Joshua, the son of Nun, your assistant, he will enter there in your place. Encourage him and strengthen him, for he is the one who will lead the people of Israel to inherit the land.

(Deuteronomy 1:39) 
Also your little children, about whom you said they would become captives, and your children who today do not know the difference between good and evil—they are the ones who will enter the land. I will give the land to them, and they shall possess it.

(Deuteronomy 1:40) 
But as for you, turn back now and travel into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’

(Deuteronomy 2:1) 
And we turned back, journeying into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea, as the Lord had commanded me. And we circled around Mount Seir for many days.

(Deuteronomy 2:2) 
Then the Lord spoke to me: "You have circled this mountain long enough.

(Deuteronomy 2:3) 
Now turn and go northward.

(Deuteronomy 2:4) 
And give this command to the people, saying: 'You will be passing through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. Be very careful,

(Deuteronomy 2:5) 
do not provoke them to battle. For I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot of ground, because I have given Mount Seir as a possession to the descendants of Esau.

(Deuteronomy 2:6) 
You must buy food from them with money to eat. And you must also buy water from them with money to drink.

(Deuteronomy 2:7) 
For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your journey, how you have traveled through this great wilderness for forty years, and you have lacked nothing.'

(Deuteronomy 2:8) 
So when we had passed through the territory of our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by way of the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber, we then arrived at the wilderness of Moab.

(Deuteronomy 2:9) 
Then the Lord said to me: "Do not treat the Moabites as enemies, nor provoke them to battle. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot."

(Deuteronomy 2:10) 
(The Emim were the first inhabitants there, a great, powerful, and tall people, just like the Anakim.

(Deuteronomy 2:11) 
Like the Anakim, they were also considered Rephaim, and the Moabites called them Emim.

(Deuteronomy 2:12) 
The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them, and then settled in their place. This was just as Israel would do in the land of their own possession, which the Lord had given to them.)

(Deuteronomy 2:13) 
Now then, get up and cross the Wadi Zered.

(Deuteronomy 2:14) 
The time from when we departed Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years. This was the time until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, just as the Lord had sworn they would.

(Deuteronomy 2:15) 
Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them to eliminate them from the camp.

(Deuteronomy 2:16) 
So after all the fighting men had perished, dying out from among the people,

(Deuteronomy 2:17) 
the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Deuteronomy 2:18) 
"Today you are to cross the boundary of Moab, near the city named Ar.

(Deuteronomy 2:19) 
And you will approach the Ammonites. Do not harass them nor provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.

(Deuteronomy 2:20) 
(That land was also considered a land of giants. In ancient times, giants lived there, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim,

(Deuteronomy 2:21) 
a great, powerful, and tall people, like the Anakim. The Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, and the Ammonites settled in their place.

(Deuteronomy 2:22) 
This was just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them and they took possession. This remains true to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 2:23) 
As for the Avvim who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)

(Deuteronomy 2:24) 
Get up now and cross the Wadi Arnon. Look, I have delivered Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land into your hand. Begin to take possession, and engage in battle against him.

(Deuteronomy 2:25) 
This very day, I will begin to put the dread and terror of you upon all the peoples who live under the sky. So that when they hear your name, they will tremble and be astonished, and feel anguish like a woman in labor.

(Deuteronomy 2:26) 
So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying:

(Deuteronomy 2:27) 
'Let me pass through your land. I will keep to the main road, not turning off to the right or to the left.

(Deuteronomy 2:28) 
Sell us food for money, so we may eat. And give us water for money, so we may drink.

(Deuteronomy 2:29) 
Only let us pass through, just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, and the Moabites who live in Ar, did for us,

(Deuteronomy 2:30) 
until we cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the Lord our God is about to give us.'

(Deuteronomy 2:31) 
But Sihon, king of Heshbon, refused to let us pass through. For the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, so that he might be delivered into your hands, just as you see today.

(Deuteronomy 2:32) 
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.

(Deuteronomy 2:33) 
And the Lord our God delivered him to us, and we struck him down, along with his sons and all his people.

(Deuteronomy 2:34) 
At that time, we captured all his cities, and we utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of those cities—men, women, and children. We left no survivors.

(Deuteronomy 2:35) 
Only the livestock we took as plunder, and the spoils from the cities we captured, were spared.

(Deuteronomy 2:36) 
From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and from the town that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a single village or city that could escape us.

(Deuteronomy 2:37) 
The Lord our God delivered everything to us, except for the land of the Ammonites, which we did not approach. And all along the Wadi Jabbok, as well as the cities in the hill country, and all the places that the Lord our God had forbidden us to touch.

(Deuteronomy 2:1) 
Then we turned back, and set out into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea, just as the Lord had told us. And we circled Mount Seir for many days.

(Deuteronomy 2:2) 
And the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Deuteronomy 2:3) 
You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn and go towards the north.

(Deuteronomy 2:4) 
And command the people, saying: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you.'

(Deuteronomy 2:5) 
Be very careful not to provoke them. For I will not give you any of their land, not even a single foot of ground, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession.

(Deuteronomy 2:6) 
You shall buy food from them with money and eat it. You shall also buy water from them with money and drink it.

(Deuteronomy 2:7) 
The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your journey, how you have traveled through this great wilderness for forty years. You have lacked nothing.

(Deuteronomy 2:8) 
So we passed by our brothers, the sons of Esau, who lived in Seir, by way of the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber. Then we came to the wilderness of Moab.

(Deuteronomy 2:9) 
And the Lord said to me: 'Do not fight against the Moabites, nor engage in battle with them. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as their possession.'

(Deuteronomy 2:10) 
The Emim once lived there, a people great and strong, and as tall as the Anakim.

(Deuteronomy 2:11) 
Like the Anakim, they were also considered giants. The Moabites called them Emim.

(Deuteronomy 2:12) 
The Horites previously lived in Seir. The sons of Esau drove them out and destroyed them, and lived in their place, just as Israel did in the land of their possession, which the Lord gave to them.

(Deuteronomy 2:13) 
'Now rise up and cross over the Zered Brook.' So we crossed over the Zered Brook.

(Deuteronomy 2:14) 
The time that we traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Brook was thirty-eight years. This was until the entire generation of fighting men from the camp had perished, just as the Lord had sworn.

(Deuteronomy 2:15) 
Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the camp.

(Deuteronomy 2:16) 
So after all the fighting men had perished, dying in the camp,

(Deuteronomy 2:17) 
the Lord spoke to me, saying:

(Deuteronomy 2:18) 
'Today you are to pass through the territory of Moab, that is, the city named Ar.

(Deuteronomy 2:19) 
And when you come near the Ammonites—the sons of Ammon—do not provoke them, nor engage in battle with them. For I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as their possession.'

(Deuteronomy 2:20) 
That land was also considered a land of giants. Giants once lived there, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim,

(Deuteronomy 2:21) 
a people great and strong, and as tall as the Anakim. The Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, and the Ammonites took their place and settled in their land.

(Deuteronomy 2:22) 
Just as He had done for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them and gave their land to them, which they have possessed to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 2:23) 
The Avvim also, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, and settled in their place.

(Deuteronomy 2:24) 
'Rise up, and cross over the Arnon River. Behold, I have delivered Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand—meaning, I have given you victory over him. Begin to take possession and wage war against him.'

(Deuteronomy 2:25) 
'Today I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon all the peoples who live under the entire sky. So that when they hear of your name, they will tremble and be in anguish like a woman in labor.'

(Deuteronomy 2:26) 
So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying:

(Deuteronomy 2:27) 
'Let me pass through your land. I will travel only along the main road. I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.'

(Deuteronomy 2:28) 
'Sell us food for money, so we may eat. Sell us water for money, and so we will drink.'

(Deuteronomy 2:29) 
'Only allow us passage through your land, just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the Lord our God is giving to us.'

(Deuteronomy 2:30) 
But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, would not allow us passage. Because the Lord your God had made his spirit stubborn and hardened his heart—so that he would resist us—so that he might be delivered into your hand, as you see today.

(Deuteronomy 2:31) 
And the Lord said to me: 'Behold, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession.'

(Deuteronomy 2:32) 
Then Sihon came out against us with all his people for battle at Jahaz.

(Deuteronomy 2:33) 
And the Lord our God delivered him to us. And we defeated him, his sons, and all his people.

(Deuteronomy 2:34) 
We captured all his cities at that time, utterly destroying every city—men, women, and children. We left no survivors in them.

(Deuteronomy 2:35) 
Except for the plunder we took and the livestock, we kept nothing from the spoils of the cities we captured for ourselves.

(Deuteronomy 2:36) 
From Aroer, which is on the bank of the Arnon River, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was no village or city that could escape us. The Lord our God delivered them all to us.

(Deuteronomy 2:37) 
Except for the land of the Ammonites, which we did not approach—that is, all along the Jabbok River, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places that the Lord our God had forbidden us to touch.

(Deuteronomy 3:1) 
So we turned and went up the road towards Bashan. Og, the King of Bashan, came out to meet us, with all his army prepared for battle; they stood ready to fight at Edrei.

(Deuteronomy 3:2) 
The Lord God then spoke to me, saying, 'Do not be afraid of him, for I have already delivered him, along with all his people and his entire land, into your hands. You will do to him exactly what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon.'

(Deuteronomy 3:3) 
So the Lord our God truly delivered Og, the king of Bashan, and his entire army into our hands. We utterly defeated him until no one was left alive.

(Deuteronomy 3:4) 
At that specific time, we conquered all his cities. These were sixty walled cities, encompassing the whole region of Argob, which was part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.

(Deuteronomy 3:5) 
All these cities were fortified, protected by very high walls, strong gates, and reinforcing bars, in addition to many, countless unwalled towns surrounding them.

(Deuteronomy 3:6) 
And we completely wiped them out, just as we had done to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. We utterly destroyed every city, killing every man, woman, and child.

(Deuteronomy 3:7) 
However, we took all the livestock and the spoils from the cities for ourselves.

(Deuteronomy 3:8) 
So, at that time, we took the land from the two Amorite kings who were east of the Jordan River. This territory stretched from the Arnon Stream all the way to Mount Hermon,

(Deuteronomy 3:9) 
Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians and Senir by the Amorites.

(Deuteronomy 3:10) 
We took all the cities of the plain, and the entire regions of Gilead and Bashan, extending to Salcah and Edrei, which were royal cities in Og's kingdom of Bashan.

(Deuteronomy 3:11) 
Truly, only Og, the king of Bashan, remained from the last of the giant races. His enormous iron bed was on display in Rabbath of the Ammonites. It measured nine cubits long and four cubits wide, according to the common measure of a man's cubit. (This means it was about 13.5 feet long and 6 feet wide, indicating his immense stature.)

(Deuteronomy 3:12) 
At that specific time, we took possession of this land. It stretched from Aroer, which is located by the Arnon Stream, including half of the mountainous region of Gilead and its cities, all of which I assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad.

(Deuteronomy 3:13) 
The remaining part of Gilead, and all of Bashan, which was Og's kingdom, I assigned to the half-tribe of Manasseh. This included the entire region of Argob. All of Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim, or 'giants'.

(Deuteronomy 3:14) 
Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of the entire region of Argob, extending all the way to the borders of Geshur and Maacah. He renamed Bashan after himself, calling it Havoth Jair—meaning 'Jair's settlements'—a name it still bears today.

(Deuteronomy 3:15) 
To Machir, I also gave the land of Gilead.

(Deuteronomy 3:16) 
And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, I gave a portion of the land of Gilead, extending as far as the Arnon Stream. This included the middle of the stream itself, acting as a boundary, and extended up to the Jabbok Stream, which marked the border of the Ammonites.

(Deuteronomy 3:17) 
I also gave them the plain, the desert areas, the Arabah valley, and the Jordan River itself, including the region of Chinnereth, stretching all the way to the Sea of the Desert, which is the very salty Dead Sea. This eastern boundary extended to the foothills of Pisgah.

(Deuteronomy 3:18) 
At that time, I gave you these instructions, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you this land as your inheritance. So, all you valiant warriors, arm yourselves and march ahead of your Israelite brothers.

(Deuteronomy 3:19) 
Your wives, little children, and livestock—and I know you have many of them—can stay safely in the cities I have given you.

(Deuteronomy 3:20) 
You must continue until the Lord grants peace and rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you. This means until they also take possession of the land that the Lord your God is about to give them on the other side of the Jordan River. Only then will each of you be free to return to the land and property I have given you.'

(Deuteronomy 3:21) 
At that same time, I also instructed Joshua, saying: 'You have personally witnessed everything the Lord your God did to these two Amorite kings. He will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.

(Deuteronomy 3:22) 
Do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God Himself will fight on your behalf.

(Deuteronomy 3:23) 
At that moment, I also pleaded with the Lord, saying:

(Deuteronomy 3:24) 
'Lord God, You are the One who began to reveal Your majesty and Your mighty power to Your servant. There is no other God in the universe, nor anywhere on the earth, who can perform the works You do, or display Your strength.

(Deuteronomy 3:25) 
Please allow me to cross over and see this excellent land beyond the Jordan River, that magnificent mountain range, and the region of Lebanon.'

(Deuteronomy 3:26) 
But the Lord was angry with me because of your transgressions, and He would not listen to my plea. He said to me:

(Deuteronomy 3:27) 
'That is enough for you. Do not speak to me about this matter again.

(Deuteronomy 3:28) 
Go up to the summit of Pisgah, and from there, look out with your own eyes towards the west, north, south, and east, and truly see the land. For you will not be crossing this Jordan River.

(Deuteronomy 3:29) 
Instead, give instructions to Joshua. Strengthen him and encourage him, because he is the one who will lead this people, and he is the one who will divide the land that you are now seeing among them.' So we (the Israelites) remained settled in the valley directly opposite Beth-peor.

(Deuteronomy 3:1) 
And we turned and went up the road to Bashan. And Og, the king of Bashan, came out against us—he and all his people—to fight us at Edrei.

(Deuteronomy 3:2) 
And the Lord said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You shall do to him just as you did to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'

(Deuteronomy 3:3) 
So the Lord our God delivered Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands. We struck him down until not a single person remained alive.

(Deuteronomy 3:4) 
At that time, we captured all of his cities—there wasn't a single town that escaped us. We took sixty cities, all the region of Argob, which was part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.

(Deuteronomy 3:5) 
All these cities were fortified with very high walls, and strengthened with the most secure walls and gates, besides countless other towns that had no walls at all.

(Deuteronomy 3:6) 
And we utterly destroyed them, just as we did to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. We completely destroyed every city, including the men, women, and little children.

(Deuteronomy 3:7) 
However, we took all the plunder and livestock for ourselves.

(Deuteronomy 3:8) 
At that time, we took the land of the two kings of the Amorites who were across the Jordan River, from the Arnon Torrent all the way to Mount Hermon.

(Deuteronomy 3:9) 
The Sidonians call Mount Hermon 'Sirion,' but the Amorites call it 'Senir'.

(Deuteronomy 3:10) 
We took all the cities of the plain, and all the land of Gilead and Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, which were cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan.

(Deuteronomy 3:11) 
Only Og, the king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the Rephaim giants. His sarcophagus can be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, measured by the standard cubit of a man's forearm.

(Deuteronomy 3:12) 
At that time, we took possession of that land from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Torrent. I gave the middle part of the hill country of Gilead and its cities to the tribes of Reuben and Gad.

(Deuteronomy 3:13) 
And the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, which was Og's kingdom, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, which included all the region of Argob. All of Bashan is called 'the land of the Rephaim' —the land of the giants.

(Deuteronomy 3:14) 
Jair, a son of Manasseh, took possession of all the region of Argob, as far as the borders of Geshur and Maachah. He named Bashan, Avoth Jair —that is, 'The Villages of Jair'—after himself, a name that remains to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 3:15) 
And to Machir I gave Gilead.

(Deuteronomy 3:16) 
And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad I gave land from Gilead as far as the Arnon Torrent—the middle of the torrent serving as their boundary—and up to the Jabbok Torrent, which is the boundary of the Ammonites.

(Deuteronomy 3:17) 
I also gave them the plain of the desert, and the Jordan River, and the borders of Chinnereth—which is the Sea of Galilee—as far as the Sea of the Arabah, which is the Salt Sea, or Dead Sea, eastward below the slopes of Pisgah.

(Deuteronomy 3:18) 
At that time, I commanded you, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All you strong men must arm yourselves and cross over before your Israelite brothers.'

(Deuteronomy 3:19) 
But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock—which I know you have in great abundance—shall remain in the cities that I have given you.

(Deuteronomy 3:20) 
You shall remain there until the Lord grants rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you, and until they also possess the land that the Lord your God is about to give them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his own possession, which I have given you.'

(Deuteronomy 3:21) 
And to Joshua I commanded at that time, saying: 'Your own eyes have seen everything that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. So will He do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.'

(Deuteronomy 3:22) 
'Do not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself will fight for you.'

(Deuteronomy 3:23) 
At that time, I also pleaded with the Lord, saying:

(Deuteronomy 3:24) 
'Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand! For there is no other God above You, in the universe and on earth, who can perform such works and powerful deeds like Yours.'

(Deuteronomy 3:25) 
'Please let me cross over and see this good land beyond the Jordan, and this excellent mountain, and Lebanon.'

(Deuteronomy 3:26) 
But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and He did not listen to me. Instead, He answered, 'Enough for you! Do not speak to Me any further about this matter.'

(Deuteronomy 3:27) 
'Go up to the top of Pisgah, and look around with your eyes to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and see it! For you shall not cross this Jordan River.'

(Deuteronomy 3:28) 
'But command Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him, because he himself shall go before this people, and he shall distribute to them the land that you are about to see.'

(Deuteronomy 3:29) 
So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.

(Deuteronomy 4:1) 
And now, Israel, listen carefully to the commands and judgments which I am teaching you today. Obey them, so that you may live and enter and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 4:2) 
You shall not add anything to the word which I speak to you, nor shall you take anything away from it. Instead, you must keep the commands of the Lord your God, which I am giving to you.

(Deuteronomy 4:3) 
Your own eyes have seen what the Lord did against Baal-Peor, where the Israelites worshipped pagan gods. The Lord destroyed all the men who followed those false gods, removing them from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 4:4) 
But you, who clung faithfully to the Lord your God, are all alive to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 4:5) 
Behold, I have taught you commands and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me to do. My purpose is for you to follow these laws in the land which you are about to enter and possess.

(Deuteronomy 4:6) 
Therefore, keep these laws and fulfill them. For this will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of all the surrounding nations. When they hear all these commands, they will declare, 'This truly is a wise and understanding people; a great nation!'

(Deuteronomy 4:7) 
There is no nation so great that has gods drawing so near to it, as the Lord our God is present to all who call upon Him with sincere hearts.

(Deuteronomy 4:8) 
And what other nation is so renowned and glorious, that it has such ceremonies, just judgments, and an entire body of law like the one I am setting before you today?

(Deuteronomy 4:9) 
Therefore, guard yourself and your soul diligently. Do not forget the words that your own eyes have witnessed, and do not let them fade from your heart throughout all the days of your life. You must teach them to your children and to your grandchildren—that is, the generations to come.

(Deuteronomy 4:10) 
Remember the day when you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, Mount Sinai, when the Lord said to me: 'Gather the people to Me, so they may hear My words. In this way, they will learn to reverence and obey Me all the time that they live on the earth, and they will teach their children to do the same.'

(Deuteronomy 4:11) 
And you approached the foot of that mountain, which burned with fire up to the visible sky. There was also deep darkness, thick clouds, and a dense mist upon it.

(Deuteronomy 4:12) 
The Lord spoke to you from the midst of that fire. You heard the sound of His words clearly, but you did not see any physical form or likeness of Him.

(Deuteronomy 4:13) 
And He declared His covenant to you, commanding you to keep the Ten Words—meaning the Ten Commandments. He then wrote them on two stone tablets.

(Deuteronomy 4:14) 
The Lord also commanded me at that time to teach you the ceremonies and the judgments which you ought to perform in the land which you are about to possess.

(Deuteronomy 4:15) 
Therefore, diligently guard your souls and pay close attention. Remember that you saw no likeness or image on the day when the Lord spoke with you in Horeb from the midst of the fire.

(Deuteronomy 4:16) 
Be careful, lest perhaps you be deceived and make for yourselves a carved likeness of anything: an image of a male or a female person.

(Deuteronomy 4:17) 
Or a likeness of any beasts that are on the earth, or of any birds flying under the sky.

(Deuteronomy 4:18) 
Or of any creeping things that move on the earth, or of any fish that dwell beneath the earth and in the waters.

(Deuteronomy 4:19) 
Be careful also, lest perhaps, lifting your eyes to the sky, you see the sun, the moon, and all the stars of the sky—the entire host of heaven—and being deceived by error, you adore them and worship them. These are things which the Lord your God created for the service of all the nations that are under the sky; they are not to be worshipped.

(Deuteronomy 4:20) 
But the Lord took you and led you out of the iron furnace of Egypt, a place of hard labor and oppression. He did this so that you might be for Him a people of inheritance—His very own possession—as you are on this present day.

(Deuteronomy 4:21) 
The Lord also became angry with me because of your complaints and your words of rebellion. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan River, nor enter that excellent land which He is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 4:22) 
Behold, I will die in this land, and I will not cross the Jordan. But you will cross over and you will possess the land.

(Deuteronomy 4:23) 
Beware lest you ever forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you. Do not make for yourselves a carved likeness of any of those things which the Lord has forbidden.

(Deuteronomy 4:24) 
For the Lord your God is a consuming fire—He is passionate and severe against sin. He is a jealous God who will not tolerate idolatry.

(Deuteronomy 4:25) 
If you beget children and grandchildren, and you remain for a long time in the land, and then, being deceived, you make for yourselves a carved likeness of anything, committing evil before the Lord your God, so as to provoke Him to anger—

(Deuteronomy 4:26) 
I call the sky and the earth to witness against you today: you will quickly perish from the land which you are about to possess after crossing the Jordan. You will not remain in it for a very long time, but the Lord will stir you up and scatter you among all the nations.

(Deuteronomy 4:27) 
And you will remain few in number among the nations to which the Lord will have led you into exile.

(Deuteronomy 4:28) 
And there, in exile, you will serve gods made of wood and stone. These are idols that cannot see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell anything.

(Deuteronomy 4:29) 
But if, when you are in exile, you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him. This will happen only if you seek Him with all your heart, and with all the tribulation and distress of your soul.

(Deuteronomy 4:30) 
After all the things that we have spoken of above happen to you—after you experience these calamities—in the latter days you will return to the Lord your God, and you will listen to His voice.

(Deuteronomy 4:31) 
Because the Lord your God is a merciful God, He will not abandon you, nor will He utterly destroy you. He will not forget the covenant which He swore to your fathers.

(Deuteronomy 4:32) 
Inquire about the ancient days that were before you, from the day when God created mankind on the earth. Ask from one end of the sky to the other, if such a word as this has ever happened, or if such a thing has ever been heard?

(Deuteronomy 4:33) 
Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of a fire, as you heard, and yet lived to tell of it?

(Deuteronomy 4:34) 
Or has God ever attempted to go in and take for Himself a nation from the midst of other nations? He did this through trials, signs, and wonders, and by strong warfare, and an outstretched hand, and a high arm, and terrible visions—just as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, right before your very eyes.

(Deuteronomy 4:35) 
All of this happened so that you might know that the Lord Himself is God, and that there is no other God besides Him.

(Deuteronomy 4:36) 
From the sky above, He made you hear His voice, so that He might teach you. And on the earth, He showed you His great fire, and you heard His powerful voices from the midst of the fire.

(Deuteronomy 4:37) 
It was because He loved your fathers, and chose their offspring after them, that He led you out. He went before you with His great power from Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 4:38) 
He did this to destroy nations greater and stronger than you as you entered their land. He brought you in and gave you their land as a possession, as you see on this present day.

(Deuteronomy 4:39) 
Know therefore today, and consider in your heart, that the Lord Himself is God in the heavens above and on the earth below. There is truly no other God.

(Deuteronomy 4:40) 
Therefore, keep His commands and precepts which I am giving to you today. This is so that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may remain for a long time upon the land which the Lord your God is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 4:1) 
Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you today. If you obey them, you will live, and you will enter and possess the land—the promised land—which the Lord God of your fathers is about to give to you.

(Deuteronomy 4:2) 
You must not add to the word that I speak to you, nor take anything away from it. Instead, you must keep the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding you today.

(Deuteronomy 4:3) 
Your own eyes have seen everything that the Lord did against Baal-Peor. The Lord completely destroyed all of his worshipers from among you.

(Deuteronomy 4:4) 
But you, who held fast to the Lord your God, all of you are still alive to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 4:5) 
Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, just as the Lord my God commanded me. You are to obey them in the land that you are about to enter and possess.

(Deuteronomy 4:6) 
Therefore, observe and perform them. For this will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations. When they hear all these statutes, they will say, 'Indeed, this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'

(Deuteronomy 4:7) 
For there is no other great nation that has gods so near to them, as our God is near to all who call upon Him.

(Deuteronomy 4:8) 
And what other nation has statutes, ceremonies, and ordinances that are as righteous as all these which I set before your eyes today?

(Deuteronomy 4:9) 
Therefore, be careful and diligently guard your soul. Do not forget the words that your own eyes have seen, and do not let them depart from your heart all the days of your life. You are to teach them to your children and your grandchildren.

(Deuteronomy 4:10) 
—especially on the day that you stood at Horeb before the Lord your God, when the Lord said to me, 'Gather the people to Me, so that they may hear My words. They are to learn to fear Me all the time that they live on the earth, and they are to teach their children.'

(Deuteronomy 4:11) 
And you approached the base of the mountain, which was burning with fire up to the sky, surrounded by darkness, cloud, and deep gloom.

(Deuteronomy 4:12) 
Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of His words, but you did not see any form or likeness.

(Deuteronomy 4:13) 
And He declared to you His covenant—His ten words, the Ten Commandments—which He wrote on two tablets of stone.

(Deuteronomy 4:14) 
And at that time, the Lord commanded me to teach you the ceremonies and ordinances that you were to perform in the land which you are about to possess.

(Deuteronomy 4:15) 
Therefore, guard your souls very carefully. For you saw no form or likeness on the day when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire.

(Deuteronomy 4:16) 
Be careful that you are not deceived into making for yourselves any carved image, any likeness of any figure, whether male or female.

(Deuteronomy 4:17) 
Be careful not to make any likeness of any animals that are on the earth, or of any birds that fly under the sky.

(Deuteronomy 4:18) 
or of any creeping things that move on the ground, or of any fish that live in the waters beneath the earth.

(Deuteronomy 4:19) 
And beware, lest you lift your eyes to the sky and see the sun and the moon and all the stars of the universe—all the celestial bodies—and be led astray by error to worship and serve them. For the Lord your God created these for the service of all the nations under the sky.

(Deuteronomy 4:20) 
But the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt—a metaphor for severe oppression—so that you might be His inheritance, His own people, as you are this present day.

(Deuteronomy 4:21) 
Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me because of your words, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan River, nor enter that excellent land which He is about to give to you.

(Deuteronomy 4:22) 
But I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. You yourselves will cross over and possess it.

(Deuteronomy 4:23) 
Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you. And do not make for yourselves any carved image of anything that the Lord has commanded you not to make.

(Deuteronomy 4:24) 
For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

(Deuteronomy 4:25) 
If you beget children and grandchildren, and you remain a long time in the land, and then you are deceived into making for yourselves any carved image, committing evil in the sight of the Lord your God, so as to provoke Him to anger:

(Deuteronomy 4:26) 
I call today the universe and the earth to witness against you. You will quickly perish from the land that you are about to possess after crossing the Jordan. You will not remain in it for a very long time, but you will be utterly destroyed and brought to nothing.

(Deuteronomy 4:27) 
And the Lord will scatter you among all the nations, and you will remain few in number among the nations to which the Lord will lead you.

(Deuteronomy 4:28) 
There you will serve gods made of wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

(Deuteronomy 4:29) 
But if you seek the Lord your God there, you will find Him, provided that you search for Him with all your heart and with all the tribulation of your soul.

(Deuteronomy 4:30) 
After all these things that have been foretold come upon you, in the last days you will return to the Lord your God, and you will listen to His voice.

(Deuteronomy 4:31) 
For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you, nor will He utterly destroy you, nor will He forget the covenant which He swore to your fathers.

(Deuteronomy 4:32) 
Indeed, inquire of the days of old, which were before you, from the day that God created mankind on the earth, from one end of the universe to the other. Has such a thing ever happened, or has anything similar ever been heard?

(Deuteronomy 4:33) 
Has any people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and remained alive?

(Deuteronomy 4:34) 
Or has God ever attempted to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of other nations, by trials, by signs and wonders, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, just as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes?

(Deuteronomy 4:35) 
This was so that you might know that the Lord Himself is God, and there is no other besides Him.

(Deuteronomy 4:36) 
From the heavens, He made you hear His voice, so that He might teach you. And on the earth, He showed you His great fire, and you heard His voice from the midst of the fire.

(Deuteronomy 4:37) 
Because He loved your fathers, and chose their descendants after them, He therefore brought you out, going before you with His great power, from Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 4:38) 
He did this to destroy many nations, even those mightier than you, at your entrance. He brought you in and gave their land to you as a possession, as you see this present day.

(Deuteronomy 4:39) 
Know therefore today, and consider in your heart, that the Lord Himself is God in the heavens above, and on the earth below, and there is no other.

(Deuteronomy 4:40) 
Therefore, keep His statutes and His commandments, which I am commanding you today, so that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may remain for a long time on the land which the Lord your God is about to give to you.

(Deuteronomy 5:1) 
Moses then summoned all of Israel and said to them: 'Listen, O Israel, to the commandments and judgments which I am speaking in your hearing today; learn them and keep them through your actions.'

(Deuteronomy 5:2) 
The Lord Our God made a covenant with us on Mount Horeb.

(Deuteronomy 5:3) 
He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all of us who are alive here today.

(Deuteronomy 5:4) 
Face to face He spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,

(Deuteronomy 5:5) 
I stood between the Lord and you at that time, as a mediator and announcer of His words, to declare to you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.

(Deuteronomy 5:6) 
I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

(Deuteronomy 5:7) 
You shall not have other gods standing before Me.

(Deuteronomy 5:8) 
You shall not make for yourself any carved image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the universe above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.

(Deuteronomy 5:9) 
You shall not adore them, nor shall you worship them; for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, repaying the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,

(Deuteronomy 5:10) 
and showing mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

(Deuteronomy 5:11) 
You shall not use the name of the Lord your God in vain; for He will not leave unpunished anyone who takes His name for a useless purpose.

(Deuteronomy 5:12) 
Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, just as the Lord your God commanded you.

(Deuteronomy 5:13) 
For six days you shall work and perform all your labor.

(Deuteronomy 5:14) 
But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. On it you shall do no work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your animals, nor the stranger who is within your gates; so that your male and female servants may rest just as you do.

(Deuteronomy 5:15) 
Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that the Lord your God led you out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

(Deuteronomy 5:16) 
Honor your father and your mother, just as the Lord your God commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may be well with you in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 5:17) 
You shall not murder.

(Deuteronomy 5:18) 
You shall not commit adultery.

(Deuteronomy 5:19) 
You shall not steal.

(Deuteronomy 5:20) 
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

(Deuteronomy 5:21) 
You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet his house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything else that belongs to him.

(Deuteronomy 5:22) 
These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more. And He wrote them on two stone tablets, which He then gave to me.

(Deuteronomy 5:23) 
But when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burning, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me.

(Deuteronomy 5:24) 
And you said: 'Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His majesty and His greatness. We have heard His voice from the midst of the fire, and we have proven today that a person can live even when God speaks with them.'

(Deuteronomy 5:25) 
'Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we will die!'

(Deuteronomy 5:26) 
'For who is there among all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and has been able to live?'

(Deuteronomy 5:27) 
'You yourself, Moses, rather, go near and hear all that the Lord our God says to you, and then you speak to us; and we will listen and do them.'

(Deuteronomy 5:28) 
When the Lord heard these words, He said to me: 'I have heard the voice of the words which this people have spoken to you; they have spoken everything well.'

(Deuteronomy 5:29) 
'Oh, that they would have this mindset, to fear Me and keep all My commandments at all times, so that it may be well with them and their children forever!'

(Deuteronomy 5:30) 
'Go and tell them: "Return to your tents."'

(Deuteronomy 5:31) 
'But you, Moses, stand here with Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the ceremonies, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, so that they may perform them in the land which I am about to give to them as a possession.'

(Deuteronomy 5:32) 
Therefore be diligent to keep and do what the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

(Deuteronomy 5:33) 
Instead, you shall walk in the way which the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may have abundant success in possessing the land.

(Deuteronomy 5:5:1) 
Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them: "Listen, O Israel, to the statutes and ordinances that I am speaking for you to hear today, so that you may learn them and carry them out through your actions."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:2) 
"The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:3) 
"He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us—all of us who are still alive and present here today."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:4) 
"He spoke with you face to face on the mountain, from the midst of the fire."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:5) 
"I was standing as a mediator between the Lord and you at that time, to announce His words to you, for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:6) 
"I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:7) 
"You shall have no other gods before Me."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:8) 
"You shall not make for yourself a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the sky above, or that is on the earth below, or that is in the waters beneath the earth."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:9) 
"You shall not adore them, nor shall you worship them, for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, who punishes the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:10) 
"And shows mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My precepts."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:11) 
"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for neither shall he be unpunished who takes His name lightly or uses it for empty things."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:12) 
"Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:13) 
"For six days you shall labor and do all your work."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:14) 
"But the seventh day is the Sabbath, that is, a day of rest for the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor the stranger who is within your gates, so that your male and female servant may rest as well as you."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:15) 
"Remember that you also were a slave in Egypt, and the Lord your God led you out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:16) 
"Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, that you may live a long time, and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God will give you."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:17) 
"You shall not kill."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:18) 
"You shall not commit adultery."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:19) 
"You shall not steal."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:20) 
"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:21) 
"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet his house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, nor anything that belongs to him."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:22) 
"These are the words which the Lord spoke to all your assembly on the mountain, from the midst of the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, with a great voice, and He added nothing more. And He wrote these ten commandments on two stone tablets and delivered them to me."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:23) 
"Now, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burning, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me and said:"

(Deuteronomy 5:5:24) 
"Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His majesty and greatness. We have heard His voice from the midst of the fire, and we have seen today that a man can live even when God speaks with him."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:25) 
"Now therefore, why should we die, and why should this great fire consume us? For if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we shall die."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:26) 
"For what flesh is there, that has heard the voice of the living God from the midst of the fire, as we have heard it, and could live?"

(Deuteronomy 5:5:27) 
"You, Moses, go near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and then speak to us; we will hear and we will do it."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:28) 
"And when the Lord heard these words, He said to me: 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have spoken well in all that they have said.'"

(Deuteronomy 5:5:29) 
"'Who will grant them this mind, that they may fear Me, and keep all My commandments at all times, so that it may go well with them and with their children forever?'"

(Deuteronomy 5:5:30) 
"Go, and tell them: 'Return to your tents.'"

(Deuteronomy 5:5:31) 
"But you, Moses, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, so that they may observe them in the land that I am giving them as a possession."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:32) 
"Therefore, be careful to do exactly as the Lord your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."

(Deuteronomy 5:5:33) 
"But you shall walk in the way which the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and that it may go well with you, and that you may remain a long time in the land which you are going to possess."

(Deuteronomy 6:1) 
These are the commands, and the ceremonies, and the laws
which the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you,
so that you may do them in the land which you are about to enter and possess.

(Deuteronomy 6:2) 
This is so that you may fear the Lord your God
and keep all His commands and precepts which I give you today—
you, and your children, and your grandchildren—all the days of your life,
and so that your days may be long upon the land.

(Deuteronomy 6:3) 
Hear, O Israel, and be careful to do them,
so that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly,
just as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey.

(Deuteronomy 6:4) 
Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.

(Deuteronomy 6:5) 
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength.

(Deuteronomy 6:6) 
And these words, which I command you today, shall be in your heart.

(Deuteronomy 6:7) 
You shall tell them to your children
and you shall meditate on them when you sit in your house, and when you walk on the road,
and when you lie down, and when you rise up.

(Deuteronomy 6:8) 
You shall bind them as a sign on your hand,
and they shall be as frontlets [phylacteries] between your eyes.

(Deuteronomy 6:9) 
And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

(Deuteronomy 6:10) 
Therefore, when the Lord your God brings you into the land
concerning which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and He gives you great and good cities, which you did not build,

(Deuteronomy 6:11) 
and houses full of all good things, which you did not furnish,
and cisterns which you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves, which you did not plant,

(Deuteronomy 6:12) 
and you eat and are satisfied,

(Deuteronomy 6:13) 
be careful lest you forget the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

(Deuteronomy 6:14) 
You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him, and swear by His Name.

(Deuteronomy 6:15) 
You shall not go after other gods of any of the peoples who are around you.

(Deuteronomy 6:16) 
For the Lord your God is a jealous God in your midst—
a God who demands your exclusive worship and fidelity—
lest the wrath of the Lord your God be kindled against you
and He destroy you from the face of the land.

(Deuteronomy 6:17) 
You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah [the place of testing].

(Deuteronomy 6:18) 
So that you may do what is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord your God,
that it may be well with you, and that you may enter and possess the good land, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers.

(Deuteronomy 6:19) 
He will cast out all your enemies before you, just as He has promised.

(Deuteronomy 6:20) 
When your son asks you in the future, saying:
"What do these testimonies, and these ceremonies, and these laws mean, which the Lord our God has commanded us?"

(Deuteronomy 6:21) 
Then you shall say to him: "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt,
and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

(Deuteronomy 6:22) 
And the Lord performed great and terrible signs and wonders in Egypt
against Pharaoh and all his household, before our very eyes.

(Deuteronomy 6:23) 
And He brought us out from there, to bring us in, and to give us the land
concerning which He swore to our fathers.

(Deuteronomy 6:24) 
And the Lord commanded us all these laws, so that we should fear the Lord our God,
for our good always, as it is today.

(Deuteronomy 6:25) 
And He will be merciful to us if we are careful to observe and do all these commands
before the Lord our God, just as He has commanded us.

(Deuteronomy 7:1) 
When you enter the land that the Lord your God will give you to possess, and He has destroyed many nations before you—the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites—these are seven nations much larger and stronger than you.

(Deuteronomy 7:2) 
And the Lord your God has delivered them to you, and you have struck them down. You must utterly destroy them. You shall not make any treaty with them, nor show them any mercy.

(Deuteronomy 7:3) 
Nor shall you join them through marriage. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor shall you take their daughter for your son.

(Deuteronomy 7:4) 
For they would turn your son away from following Me, and he would rather serve foreign gods. Then the Lord's anger will burn against you, and He will quickly destroy you.

(Deuteronomy 7:5) 
Instead, you shall do this to them: you must tear down their altars, shatter their statues, cut down their sacred groves, and burn their carved idols with fire.

(Deuteronomy 7:6) 
For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a special people for Himself, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.

(Deuteronomy 7:7) 
It was not because you were greater in number than any other nation that the Lord joined Himself to you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples.

(Deuteronomy 7:8) 
But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath that He swore to your fathers that He brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 7:9) 
Know then that the Lord your God, He is God—a mighty and faithful God, who keeps His covenant and shows mercy to those who love Him and observe His commandments, to a thousand generations.

(Deuteronomy 7:10) 
But He immediately repays those who hate Him by utterly destroying them, and He does not delay to repay the one who hates Him—He promptly gives him what he deserves.

(Deuteronomy 7:11) 
Therefore, keep the commandments and the ceremonies, and the judgments that I am commanding you today to perform.

(Deuteronomy 7:12) 
If you listen to these judgments and carefully observe and perform them, then the Lord your God will also keep for you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers.

(Deuteronomy 7:13) 
And He will love you, and multiply you, and bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land—your grain, and your wine, your oil, and the increase of your cattle and the lambs of your flock in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you.

(Deuteronomy 7:14) 
You will be blessed above all peoples. There will be no barrenness among you, neither male nor female, whether among your people or your livestock.

(Deuteronomy 7:15) 
The Lord will remove from you every sickness, and He will not bring upon you any of the dreadful diseases of Egypt, which you know so well, but He will inflict them upon all your enemies.

(Deuteronomy 7:16) 
And you shall devour all the peoples whom the Lord your God will deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would become a ruin for you—a snare.

(Deuteronomy 7:17) 
If you should say in your heart: "These nations are more numerous than I am; how can I destroy them?"

(Deuteronomy 7:18) 
Do not fear them, but remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all the Egyptians.

(Deuteronomy 7:19) 
Remember the great plagues which your eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. So will the Lord do to all the peoples whom you fear.

(Deuteronomy 7:20) 
Moreover, the Lord your God will send hornets among them, until all who remain and have hidden themselves from you in flight are destroyed to death.

(Deuteronomy 7:21) 
You shall not fear them, because the Lord your God is in your midst—a great and terrible God.

(Deuteronomy 7:22) 
He Himself will consume these nations before you little by little, and piece by piece. You will not be able to destroy them all at once, so that the beasts of the earth do not increase against you in great numbers.

(Deuteronomy 7:23) 
And the Lord your God will deliver them into your sight and will destroy them with a great confusion until they are utterly wiped out.

(Deuteronomy 7:24) 
He will deliver their kings into your hands, and you shall blot out their names from under the sky. No one will be able to resist you until you have crushed them.

(Deuteronomy 7:25) 
You shall burn their carved images with fire. Do not covet the silver and gold that is on them, nor take anything from them for yourself, lest you be ensnared by it. For it is an abomination to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 7:26) 
And you shall not bring anything from an idol into your house, lest you become accursed like it. You shall utterly detest it as filth and abomination, and flee from it as defilement, for it is something dedicated to destruction.

(Deuteronomy 8:null) 
He humbled you with hunger and then gave you manna to eat—food that neither you nor your fathers had ever known. He did this to show you that a human being does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord your God.

It is a land of wheat, barley, and vineyards, where fig trees, pomegranates, and olive groves grow. It is a land flowing with oil and honey.

Just as the nations that the Lord destroyed before you, so also will you perish if you are disobedient to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 8:2) 
And you will remember all the journey through which the Lord your God led you for forty years through the desert, so that He might humble you and test you. This was to reveal what was truly in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.

(Deuteronomy 8:3) 
He humbled you with scarcity and gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known. This was to show you that humanity does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 8:4) 
Your clothing did not wear out at any time, and your sandals did not tear on your feet throughout those forty years.

(Deuteronomy 8:5) 
So you must know that just as a father disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplined you.

(Deuteronomy 8:6) 
You are to keep the commandments of the Lord your God, walk in His ways, and revere Him.

(Deuteronomy 8:7) 
For the Lord your God will bring you into a good land—a land of flowing streams, springs, and deep waters that emerge from valleys and mountains.

(Deuteronomy 8:8) 
A land of wheat, barley, and vineyards, where figs, pomegranates, and olives—from which oil is pressed—will grow.

(Deuteronomy 8:9) 
A land of oil and honey, where you will eat your bread without any scarcity, and you will enjoy the abundance of all things, with no scarcity whatsoever.

(Deuteronomy 8:10) 
So that you may eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God for the excellent land which He has given to you.

(Deuteronomy 8:11) 
Be very careful never to forget the Lord your God and neglect His commandments, judgments, and ceremonies, which I command you today.

(Deuteronomy 8:12) 
Lest after you have eaten and are satisfied, you build beautiful houses and settle in them—

(Deuteronomy 8:13) 
and your flocks of sheep and herds of cattle have multiplied, and your abundance of silver, gold, and all possessions has grown—

(Deuteronomy 8:14) 
and your heart becomes proud, causing you to forget the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

(Deuteronomy 8:15) 
He led you through that great and terrible desert, where there were fiery serpents, scorpions, and vipers, and a land without water. He brought forth water for you from the hardest rock.

(Deuteronomy 8:16) 
And He fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known. He sustained and tested you with these trials so that, in the end, He might show you His mercy.

(Deuteronomy 8:17) 
You must not say in your heart, 'My own strength and the might of my hand have provided all these things for me.'

(Deuteronomy 8:18) 
Instead, you must remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the strength to possess this land. He does this to fulfill His covenant, which He swore to your fathers, just as it is being fulfilled today.

(Deuteronomy 8:19) 
But if you forget the Lord your God and follow foreign gods, serving and worshipping them, behold, I declare to you now that you will utterly perish.

(Deuteronomy 8:20) 
Just as the Lord destroyed the nations when you entered their land, so you also will perish if you are disobedient to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 9:1) 
Listen, Israel: Today you will cross over the Jordan River. You are going to take possession of nations that are very great and strong, and their cities are huge, with walls built up to the sky.

(Deuteronomy 9:2) 
You will encounter a great and towering people, the sons of Anak, whom you already know, and about whom you have heard it said: 'Who can stand against the sons of Anak?'

(Deuteronomy 9:3) 
Understand this today: The Lord your God Himself will cross over before you, like a consuming fire. He will crush these nations, and He will destroy and overthrow them before your very eyes. He will quickly wipe them out, and you will drive them out swiftly.

(Deuteronomy 9:4) 
Do not say in your heart, when the Lord your God has destroyed these nations before you, that He brought you in to possess this land because of your own righteousness. Instead, the Lord will destroy them as you enter the land because of the wickedness of those nations.

(Deuteronomy 9:5) 
You are not entering to take possession of their lands because of your own righteousness or the uprightness of your heart. It is because those nations have sinned wickedly that He will destroy them as you enter. This is also so that He may fulfill His promise, which He swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Deuteronomy 9:6) 
Know, therefore, that the Lord your God is not giving you this excellent land to possess because of your own righteousness. This is because you are a stubborn people, hard-headed and unyielding.

(Deuteronomy 9:7) 
Remember, and do not forget, how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived at this very place, you have always contended with the Lord, opposing His will.

(Deuteronomy 9:8) 
For even at Horeb, you provoked Him to anger, and the Lord was so furious that He wanted to destroy you entirely.

(Deuteronomy 9:9) 
This was when I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets—the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you. I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, during which I ate no bread and drank no water.

(Deuteronomy 9:10) 
Then the Lord gave me two stone tablets, written with the very finger of God. These contained all the words He had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire, when the people were gathered together.

(Deuteronomy 9:11) 
And when the forty days and forty nights had passed, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.

(Deuteronomy 9:12) 
Then the Lord said to me: 'Get up and go down from here quickly, because your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have sinned. They have very quickly abandoned the way that I commanded them, and they have made a molten idol for themselves.'

(Deuteronomy 9:13) 
And again, the Lord said to me: 'I see that this people is stubborn and unyielding.'

(Deuteronomy 9:14) 
'Let me alone, so that I may crush them and erase their name from under the sky. Then I will make you into a nation much greater and stronger than this one is.'

(Deuteronomy 9:15) 
So, as I came down from the mountain, which was burning fiercely, and held the two tablets of the covenant in my hands, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had made yourselves a molten calf, and you had quickly abandoned His way that He had shown you.

(Deuteronomy 9:16) 
And I threw both tablets from my hands, shattering them before your very eyes.

(Deuteronomy 9:17) 
Then I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights. I ate no food and drank no water, because of all the sins you had committed, by which you had sinned against the Lord and provoked Him to wrath.

(Deuteronomy 9:18) 
For I was afraid of His fierce anger and indignation, with which He was stirred up against you, wanting to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me on this occasion as well, and relented.

(Deuteronomy 9:19) 
Even against Aaron, the Lord was intensely angry, wanting to destroy him. And I interceded for him also.

(Deuteronomy 9:20) 
Also, at Taberah, and at Massah, and at the graves of craving, you provoked the Lord with your complaints and desires.

(Deuteronomy 9:21) 
It was also when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and take possession of the land which I have given to you.' Yet you despised the command of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him, nor were you willing to listen to His voice.

(Deuteronomy 9:22) 
From the day you left Egypt until this very place, you have always been rebellious against the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 9:23) 
And when the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' you despised the command of the Lord your God. You did not believe Him, nor were you willing to listen to His voice.

(Deuteronomy 9:24) 
Again, I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights, just as I had previously, so that He would not destroy you.

(Deuteronomy 9:25) 
And I prayed to the Lord, saying: 'O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, whom You redeemed in Your great power and led out of Egypt with a mighty hand.'

(Deuteronomy 9:26) 
'Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look upon the stubbornness of this people, nor their wickedness, nor their sin.'

(Deuteronomy 9:27) 
'Otherwise, the inhabitants of the land from which You brought us out might say: 'The Lord was not able to bring them into the land He promised them, and He hated them; therefore, He led them out and killed them in the wilderness.''

(Deuteronomy 9:28) 
'Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out with Your great strength and with Your outstretched arm.'

(Deuteronomy 9:29) 
These are the words which the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

(Deuteronomy 9:1) 
Hear this, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan River this very day to dispossess nations far greater and stronger than yourselves, possessing immense cities with walls so fortified they seem to touch the very sky.

(Deuteronomy 9:2) 
You will face a people of immense stature, dwelling behind high walls. These are the Anakim, whom you already know and have heard about, a lineage so mighty that no one, however strong, has ever been able to resist them.

(Deuteronomy 9:3) 
Therefore, know this day that the Lord your God Himself will go before you. He is a consuming and devouring fire, and He Himself will utterly crush them and swiftly destroy them before your very eyes. You will drive them out and swiftly annihilate them, just as the Lord has promised you.

(Deuteronomy 9:4) 
Do not say in your heart, once the Lord your God has destroyed them before you: 'It is because of my own righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land.' Understand instead that it is because of the wickedness of those nations that the Lord drives them out from before you.

(Deuteronomy 9:5) 
For you are not entering to possess their land because of your own righteousness or the uprightness of your heart. Rather, it is because those nations acted wickedly, and also so that the Lord might fulfill His word, which He solemnly promised to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Deuteronomy 9:6) 
Know therefore that it is not because of your own righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this excellent land as a possession, for you are truly a stiff-necked people, stubbornly resistant to His will.

(Deuteronomy 9:7) 
Remember this and never forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the very day you departed from Egypt until you reached this present place, you have continually contended against the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 9:8) 
Indeed, even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to anger, and His wrath became so great that He intended to destroy you completely.

(Deuteronomy 9:9) 
I recall when I ascended the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the very tablets of the covenant which the Lord had made with you. I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, during which I neither ate bread nor drank water.

(Deuteronomy 9:10) 
And the Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God, containing all the words that He had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire, when He addressed the people directly.

(Deuteronomy 9:11) 
And when the forty days and forty nights had passed, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.

(Deuteronomy 9:12) 
Then the Lord said to me: 'Arise, and descend from here quickly, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have thoroughly corrupted themselves. They have swiftly departed from the path I commanded them, and they have made for themselves a molten idol.'

(Deuteronomy 9:13) 
And again the Lord said to me: 'I perceive that this people is indeed stiff-necked and rebellious.'

(Deuteronomy 9:14) 
'Leave Me alone now, that I may utterly crush them and blot out their name from under the entire sky. Then I will make you into a nation far greater and stronger than this one.'

(Deuteronomy 9:15) 
So I turned and began to descend from the mountain, which was burning with fire, carrying the two tablets in my two hands.

(Deuteronomy 9:16) 
And there I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had swiftly departed from His way which He had clearly shown to you.

(Deuteronomy 9:17) 
Therefore, I threw down the two tablets from my hands and shattered them before your very eyes, as a sign of the covenant you had broken.

(Deuteronomy 9:18) 
Then I prostrated myself before the Lord, just as before, for forty days and forty nights, neither eating bread nor drinking water, all on account of your great sin—the sin by which you had offended the Lord and done evil in His sight, provoking His burning anger.

(Deuteronomy 9:19) 
For I was terrified by the fierce anger and indignation with which He was enraged against you, and by His desire to utterly destroy you. Yet, the Lord listened to me even on this occasion.

(Deuteronomy 9:20) 
The Lord was also exceedingly angry with Aaron, intending to destroy him. And I interceded for Aaron as well.

(Deuteronomy 9:21) 
As for the heinous idol you had made—that calf—I burned it with fire, then ground it into small pieces, pulverizing it into dust. I then scattered this dust into the torrent that flowed down from the mountain.

(Deuteronomy 9:22) 
Even at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you again provoked the Lord to anger with your incessant complaints and desires.

(Deuteronomy 9:23) 
And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and take possession of the land which I have given to you,' you refused to go up. Instead, you were disobedient to the command of the Lord your God, showing disbelief in His word.

(Deuteronomy 9:24) 
Indeed, you have been rebellious against the Lord from the very first day I began to know you.

(Deuteronomy 9:25) 
And so, I lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights, during which I continually pleaded with Him not to destroy you, just as He had threatened to do.

(Deuteronomy 9:26) 
And as I prayed, I said: 'O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed by Your magnificent power, and whom You led out of Egypt with a mighty hand.'

(Deuteronomy 9:27) 
'Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, nor their wickedness, nor their sin.'

(Deuteronomy 9:28) 
'Otherwise, the inhabitants of the land from which You brought us out might say: "Because the Lord was unable to bring them into the land He promised them, and because He hated them, He led them out into the wilderness to kill them."

(Deuteronomy 9:29) 
'Yet, they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out with Your great strength and Your outstretched arm.'

At that time, the Lord said to me: "Carve out two tablets of stone for yourself, just like the first ones were, and come up to me on the mountain; and you will also make a wooden ark."

(Deuteronomy 10:2) 
"And I will write on these tablets the very same words that were on the first ones, which you broke; and you will place these new tablets in the ark."

(Deuteronomy 10:3) 
So I made an ark from acacia wood, and I carved out two tablets of stone in the exact likeness of the first ones, and I went up onto the mountain, holding them in my hands.

(Deuteronomy 10:4) 
And He wrote on these tablets, just as He had written before, the ten words—the Ten Commandments—which the Lord had spoken to all of you on the mountain from the midst of the fire when all the people were gathered; and then He gave these tablets to me.

(Deuteronomy 10:5) 
And I, having returned from the mountain, placed the tablets in the ark which I had made, just as the Lord had commanded me; and those tablets have remained there in the ark to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 10:6) 
Now the children of Israel moved their camp from Beeroth of the sons of Jaacan to Moserath; it was there that Aaron died and was buried. And Eleazar, his son, served in the priesthood in his place.

(Deuteronomy 10:7) 
From there, departing from Moserath, they came to Gadgad; and from Gadgad they moved on to Jotbathah, a place known for its many waters.

(Deuteronomy 10:8) 
At that very time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the Lord's covenant, and to stand before Him in dedicated service, and to bless the people in His name, a role that continues even to this present day.

(Deuteronomy 10:9) 
Therefore, the tribe of Levi has no share or inheritance alongside their brothers, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance and possession, just as the Lord your God spoke to them.

(Deuteronomy 10:10) 
And I, as before, stood on the mountain for forty days and forty nights; and the Lord heard my prayer even concerning this matter, and He did not wish to destroy you.

(Deuteronomy 10:11) 
And the Lord then said to me: "Arise, and go before the people, so that they may enter and take possession of the land which I swore to their fathers I would give to them."

(Deuteronomy 10:12) 
And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you, but that you fear the Lord your God—meaning, hold Him in reverential awe—and walk in His ways, and love Him, and serve the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul?

(Deuteronomy 10:13) 
What He asks is that you keep the commandments of the Lord and His ordinances, which I command you today, so that it may be well with you.

(Deuteronomy 10:14) 
Behold, the Lord your God owns the entire universe, and the highest heavens beyond our comprehension, the earth, and everything that exists in it.

(Deuteronomy 10:15) 
Yet, despite His infinite dominion, the Lord took delight in your fathers and loved them; and He chose their descendants after them—that is, all of you—from all the peoples of the earth, just as it is proven even to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 10:16) 
Therefore, spiritually circumcise the foreskin of your heart, meaning, cut away all that is sinful and worldly, and do not stiffen your neck in stubbornness any longer.

(Deuteronomy 10:17) 
Because the Lord your God, He alone is the God of all gods and the Lord of all lords, a great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, who shows no partiality and takes no bribes.

(Deuteronomy 10:18) 
He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.

(Deuteronomy 10:19) 
Therefore, you also must love strangers, because you yourselves were once strangers in the land of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 10:20) 
You shall fear the Lord your God, and you shall serve Him alone; you shall cling to Him, and you shall swear by His holy name.

(Deuteronomy 10:21) 
He is your praise, and your God, who has done for you all these great and awe-inspiring things that your very eyes have seen.

(Deuteronomy 10:22) 
Your fathers went down to Egypt with only seventy souls, and behold, now the Lord your God has multiplied you until you are as numerous as the stars of the universe.

(Deuteronomy 10:1) 
At that time, the Lord said to me: 'Cut for yourself two stone tablets, just like the first ones you broke, and come up to me on the mountain. And then make a wooden ark, a special box to hold these new tablets.'

(Deuteronomy 10:2) 
And I will write on these new tablets the same words that were on the first ones you shattered. Then, you will place these tablets inside the ark you made.

(Deuteronomy 10:3) 
So I constructed the ark from acacia wood, and I carved two stone tablets, just like the original ones. Then, I ascended the mountain, carrying these two tablets with me.

(Deuteronomy 10:4) 
And the Lord wrote on these tablets the ten sacred commands, exactly as He had written them the first time. These were the very words the Lord spoke to you on the mountain, from the heart of the fire, when all the people were gathered. And then He gave them to me.

(Deuteronomy 10:5) 
Then, I descended from the mountain and returned to you. I placed the tablets inside the ark that I had made, and they have remained there to this very day, just as the Lord had commanded me.

(Deuteronomy 10:6) 
Now, the sons of Israel moved their camp from Beeroth Bene Jaakan and came to Moserah. It was there that Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took his place as priest.

(Deuteronomy 10:7) 
From Moserah, they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah, they moved to Jotbathah, a land where there were streams and running water.

(Deuteronomy 10:8) 
At that particular time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi. They were designated to carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before Him in service, and to bless the people in His name, a role they continue to fulfill to this present day.

(Deuteronomy 10:9) 
This is why the Levites did not receive a share of the land or an inheritance alongside their fellow tribes. For the Lord Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as the Lord your God told them.

(Deuteronomy 10:10) 
As for me, I stood on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, just as I had done before. And the Lord listened to my pleas even on this occasion, and He chose not to destroy you, the people.

(Deuteronomy 10:11) 
Then the Lord said to me: 'Rise, and lead the people forward, so that they may enter and take possession of the land that I swore to give to their ancestors.'

(Deuteronomy 10:12) 
And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God truly ask of you? Is it not to revere the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul?

(Deuteronomy 10:13) 
What He asks is that you keep the commandments of the Lord and His ceremonies, which I am giving to you today, so that things may go well for you and you may prosper.

(Deuteronomy 10:14) 
Behold, the Lord your God is the Creator and Owner of the sky, and even the highest heavens, the earth, and everything that exists within it. All belongs to Him.

(Deuteronomy 10:15) 
Nevertheless, the Lord desired to bind Himself to your ancestors and He loved them. And He chose their descendants after them—that is, you—from all the nations, as is clearly evident today.

(Deuteronomy 10:16) 
Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart, meaning, cut away all spiritual impurities and harden your neck no longer against God’s will. Do not be stubborn.

(Deuteronomy 10:17) 
For the Lord your God is indeed the God of all lesser gods, and the Lord of all earthly rulers. He is a great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed.

(Deuteronomy 10:18) 
He renders justice for the orphan and the widow. He loves the foreigner and provides him with food and clothing.

(Deuteronomy 10:19) 
So you too must love foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 10:20) 
You shall revere the Lord your God, and Him alone you shall serve. To Him you shall hold fast, and by His name alone you shall swear your oaths.

(Deuteronomy 10:21) 
He is your praise and your God, the one who performed these great and awesome deeds for you, which your own eyes have witnessed.

(Deuteronomy 10:22) 
Your ancestors went down into Egypt with only seventy people. But now, behold, the Lord your God has multiplied you until you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.

(Deuteronomy 10:23) 
I will not give further commandments concerning this among you now, because all your deeds are known to me, and all your thoughts are hidden from no one and known to me.

(Deuteronomy 10:24) 
I will not speak further about this among you, for all your deeds are already accomplished and known, and all your thoughts are known to me and cannot be hidden.

(Deuteronomy 10:25) 
If you devise any schemes against me, I will no longer tolerate this, and will not grant you any further reprieve.

(Deuteronomy 10:26) 
I will grant you whatever you desire concerning this, provided that you are not against me.

(Deuteronomy 10:27) 
Even if you sin, I will grant you forgiveness for this.

(Deuteronomy 10:28) 
I will not grant you this, however, if you are stubborn and refuse to listen to my word.

(Deuteronomy 10:29) 
I will not grant you this, if you are idolaters and worship false idols.

(Deuteronomy 10:30) 
I will not grant you this, if you are blasphemous and lie under false oaths.

(Deuteronomy 10:31) 
I will not grant you this, if you are impious and shed innocent blood.

(Deuteronomy 10:32) 
I will not grant you this, if you are fornicators and commit adultery.

(Deuteronomy 10:33) 
I will not grant you this, if you are greedy and acquire money unjustly.

(Deuteronomy 10:34) 
I will not grant you this, if you are proud and despise your neighbor.

(Deuteronomy 10:35) 
I will not grant you this, if you are envious and rejoice at the misfortunes of others.

(Deuteronomy 10:36) 
I will not grant you this, if you are slanderers and secretly harm your neighbor.

(Deuteronomy 10:37) 
I will not grant you this, if you are quick to anger and injure your neighbor in your wrath.

(Deuteronomy 10:38) 
I will not grant you this, if you are contentious and cause harm to your neighbor in disputes.

(Deuteronomy 10:39) 
I will not grant you this, if you are rebellious and rise up against me and against my law.

(Deuteronomy 10:40) 
I will not grant you this, if you are faithless and do not believe in me and in my words.

(Deuteronomy 11:1) 
Therefore, you will love the Lord your God, and keep His commandments, His rituals, His judgments, and His instructions at all times.

(Deuteronomy 11:2) 
Understand today what your children did not know or experience, because they did not see the discipline of the Lord your God. They did not see His great deeds, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm—

(Deuteronomy 11:3) 
—the signs and wonders He performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh, its king, and against all of his land.

(Deuteronomy 11:4) 
You also saw what He did to the Egyptian army, their horses, and their chariots: how He covered them with the waters of the Red Sea when they pursued you. The Lord destroyed them, and that destruction continues to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 11:5) 
You saw what He did for you in the desert until you came to this very place.

(Deuteronomy 11:6) 
And you saw what happened to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Reuben. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their households, their tents, and all their possessions that they had in the midst of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 11:7) 
Your own eyes have seen all the great works that the Lord performed.

(Deuteronomy 11:8) 
Therefore, keep all His commandments which I command you today, so that you may live, multiply, and go in to possess the land to which you are heading.

(Deuteronomy 11:9) 
And you will live in it for many days—a land that the Lord promised with an oath to your fathers and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.

(Deuteronomy 11:10) 
For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came. There, after sowing your seed, you had to irrigate it by foot, like a vegetable garden.

(Deuteronomy 11:11) 
But this land is mountainous and has plains, and it relies on rain from the sky.

(Deuteronomy 11:12) 
The Lord your God always watches over it, and His eyes are upon it from the beginning of the year to its end.

(Deuteronomy 11:13) 
Therefore, if you obey My commandments which I command you today—that you love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul—

(Deuteronomy 11:14) 
—then I will give rain to your land at its proper time, both the early and the late rains, so that you may gather your grain, your wine, and your oil.

(Deuteronomy 11:15) 
I will also provide grass in your fields for your livestock, so that you may eat and be satisfied.

(Deuteronomy 11:16) 
Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away from the Lord to serve foreign gods and worship them.

(Deuteronomy 11:17) 
Otherwise, the Lord will be angry with you and shut up the sky, so that no rain will fall, and the earth will not yield its produce. Then you will quickly perish from the excellent land that the Lord is giving you.

(Deuteronomy 11:18) 
Therefore, lay these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls. Tie them as a sign on your hands and place them between your eyes as a reminder.

(Deuteronomy 11:19) 
Teach them to your children, that they may meditate on them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

(Deuteronomy 11:20) 
You shall also write them on the doorposts and gates of your house.

(Deuteronomy 11:21) 
Do this so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, for as long as the sky stretches over the earth.

(Deuteronomy 11:22) 
For if you carefully keep all these commandments that I am giving you today, and carry them out, so that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all His ways, and cling to Him—

(Deuteronomy 11:23) 
—then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess them, even those nations that are larger and stronger than you.

(Deuteronomy 11:24) 
Every place that your foot steps upon will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert and Lebanon, from the River Euphrates to the western sea.

(Deuteronomy 11:25) 
No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will put the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you are about to tread upon, just as He promised you.

(Deuteronomy 11:26) 
See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse.

(Deuteronomy 11:27) 
The blessing will come if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 11:28) 
The curse will come if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way that I am showing you today, and follow other gods whom you have not known.

(Deuteronomy 11:29) 
When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are going to possess, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

(Deuteronomy 11:30) 
These mountains are across the Jordan, along the road that leads toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the plains opposite Gilgal, near the valley of Moreh which rises from the opposite side.

(Deuteronomy 11:31) 
For you are about to cross the Jordan to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You will hold it and live in it.

(Deuteronomy 11:32) 
Therefore, be careful to diligently observe all the rituals and judgments that I am setting before you today.

(Deuteronomy 11:1) 
Therefore, you must love the Lord your God. You must also keep His commands, rituals, ordinances, and statutes at all times.

(Deuteronomy 11:2) 
Understand this today: I am not speaking to your children, who have not known and have not seen the instruction of the Lord your God. They did not see His great deeds, His strong hand, and His outstretched arm.

(Deuteronomy 11:3) 
They did not see the miracles and works He performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh the king, and against all of his land.

(Deuteronomy 11:4) 
They did not see what He did to the army of the Egyptians, to their horses and chariots. They did not see how the waters of the Red Sea covered them when they were pursuing you, and how the Lord utterly destroyed them, even to this present day.

(Deuteronomy 11:5) 
They did not see what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came to this place.

(Deuteronomy 11:6) 
They did not see what happened to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Reuben. They did not see how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with their tents and all their possessions which they had in the midst of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 11:7) 
Indeed, your very own eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which He performed.

(Deuteronomy 11:8) 
Therefore, keep all the commands that I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply. You will then enter and possess the land to which you are going.

(Deuteronomy 11:9) 
This is so you may live long lives in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers and to their descendants to give them—a land flowing with milk and honey.

(Deuteronomy 11:10) 
For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came. In Egypt, you sowed your seed and watered the dry ground with your foot, like a garden that is irrigated by hand or foot-powered pumps.

(Deuteronomy 11:11) 
But this land is mountainous and has level plains, and it relies on rain from the sky.

(Deuteronomy 11:12) 
The Lord your God always watches over this land. His eyes are upon it from the beginning of the year to its very end.

(Deuteronomy 11:13) 
Therefore, if you obey my commands that I am giving you today, so that you love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,

(Deuteronomy 11:14) 
then I will give rain to your land at its proper time—the early rain and the latter rain. This is so you may gather your grain, your wine, and your oil.

(Deuteronomy 11:15) 
I will also provide green pasture in your fields, so that your livestock may eat and you yourselves may be satisfied.

(Deuteronomy 11:16) 
Beware lest your heart be deceived and you turn away from the Lord. Do not serve foreign gods and worship them.

(Deuteronomy 11:17) 
Otherwise, the Lord's anger will burn against you. He will close the sky so that no rain comes down, and the land will not yield its fruit. You will quickly perish from the excellent land which the Lord is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 11:18) 
Therefore, place these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls. Tie them as a sign on your hands for a constant reminder, and place them between your eyes as a visible token.

(Deuteronomy 11:19) 
Teach them to your children, so that they may always ponder these words. Speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.

(Deuteronomy 11:20) 
Also, write them on the doorposts and on the gates of your house.

(Deuteronomy 11:21) 
This is so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the sky hangs over the earth—which means forever.

(Deuteronomy 11:22) 
For if you keep these commands that I am giving you and perform them, so that you love the Lord your God and walk in all His ways, holding fast to Him,

(Deuteronomy 11:23) 
then the Lord will drive out all these nations before your presence. You will possess them, even though they are much greater and stronger than you.

(Deuteronomy 11:24) 
Every place that your foot treads upon will be yours. Your boundaries will extend from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the great river Euphrates, even to the western sea—the Mediterranean.

(Deuteronomy 11:25) 
No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will put the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you are about to tread upon, just as He promised you.

(Deuteronomy 11:26) 
I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse.

(Deuteronomy 11:27) 
A blessing, if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 11:28) 
But a curse, if you do not obey the commands of the Lord your God, and instead turn aside from the way that I am now showing you. This curse will come if you walk after foreign gods whom you do not know.

(Deuteronomy 11:29) 
Therefore, when you enter the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, you shall pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

(Deuteronomy 11:30) 
These mountains are beyond the Jordan, following the road that leads westward, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plains opposite Gilgal. This Gilgal is near the valley that extends far inward.

(Deuteronomy 11:31) 
For you are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you will hold it.

(Deuteronomy 11:32) 
Therefore, observe and fulfill all the rituals and ordinances that I am setting before you today.

(Deuteronomy 12:1) 
These are the commandments, the regulations, and the rulings
which you must carefully observe in the land that the Lord God of your fathers is about to give you to possess—
for as long as you live on that land.

(Deuteronomy 12:2) 
You must completely demolish every place where the nations you are about to dispossess have worshipped their false gods—
whether on high mountains, or on hills, or under every lush, leafy tree.

(Deuteronomy 12:3) 
You must tear down their altars, and shatter their sacred statues.
Cut down their groves of false worship, and burn their idols with fire.
And completely erase the names of those gods from those places.

(Deuteronomy 12:4) 
You must not worship the Lord your God in that manner.

(Deuteronomy 12:5) 
Instead, you must go to the specific place that the Lord your God chooses from all your tribes
to establish His name there and to make His dwelling permanent—
that is the only place you must go to worship Him.

(Deuteronomy 12:6) 
And in that place alone, you are to offer your burnt offerings and your sacrificial victims,
your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor,
your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings,
along with the firstborn of your cattle and your sheep.

(Deuteronomy 12:7) 
And there, in the presence of the Lord your God, you are to eat your sacred meals and rejoice
in everything you have accomplished, you and your households,
for the Lord your God has blessed you in all these things.

(Deuteronomy 12:8) 
You must not continue to do there—in the Promised Land—what we do here today in the wilderness,
where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes.

(Deuteronomy 12:9) 
For up until this present time, you have not yet reached the place of rest
and the possession that the Lord your God is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 12:10) 
You will cross the Jordan River and settle in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you,
so that you may be at rest from all your enemies on every side.
Then you will live in that land without any fear.

(Deuteronomy 12:11) 
And there will be one specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell permanently.
To that one place alone, you must bring everything I command you:
your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the firstfruits of your labor,
and whatever you have vowed to the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 12:12) 
And you are to feast there before the Lord your God, you and your sons and daughters,
your male and female servants, and the Levites who live in your towns,
because the Levites have no other allotted portion or possession with you.

(Deuteronomy 12:13) 
Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see fit.

(Deuteronomy 12:14) 
Instead, you must offer your oblations only in the place that the Lord chooses in one of your tribes,
and there you must do everything I command you today.

(Deuteronomy 12:15) 
However, if you find yourself hungry and wish to eat meat, you may eat as much as your soul desires,
in all your towns, except for those animals that are offered as sacrifices to the Lord—these you are permitted to eat.

(Deuteronomy 12:16) 
Only, you must not consume the blood. Instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.

(Deuteronomy 12:17) 
You will not be allowed to eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain, wine, and oil,
nor the firstborn of your herds and flocks, nor anything you have vowed as an offering,
nor any freewill offering, nor the firstfruits of your labor.

(Deuteronomy 12:18) 
Instead, you must eat these things before the Lord your God
in the place that the Lord your God chooses—you and your son and daughter, your male and female servant,
and the Levite who lives in your towns.
And you will rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord your God in all the work of your hands.

(Deuteronomy 12:19) 
Be careful not to neglect the Levite throughout all the time you are living as a sojourner in your land.

(Deuteronomy 12:20) 
When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, just as He has promised you,
and you desire to eat meat, because your soul longs for it,

(Deuteronomy 12:21) 
and if the chosen place, where the Lord your God has placed His name, is too far away for you to bring your sacrifices to,
then you may slaughter any of your cattle or sheep that the Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you.
And you may eat the meat in your own towns, according to all that your soul desires.

(Deuteronomy 12:22) 
You may eat it just as you would eat a gazelle or a deer; anyone, whether ritually clean or unclean,
may eat it together, freely.

(Deuteronomy 12:23) 
Only be very careful not to eat the blood; for the blood is their life itself.
And for that reason, you must not consume the life of the meat.

(Deuteronomy 12:24) 
Instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.

(Deuteronomy 12:25) 
If you do what is displeasing to the Lord, and what is evil in His sight,
it will go well for you and for your children after you.

(Deuteronomy 12:26) 
Therefore, the holy things that you have consecrated and vowed to the Lord,
your assembly must take up, and you must come to the place that the Lord chooses.

(Deuteronomy 12:27) 
And you are to offer your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God.
As for the meat of your other sacrifices, it shall be slaughtered,
and its blood will be poured out upon the altar.

(Deuteronomy 12:28) 
Observe and obey all these things that I command you today,
so that it may go well for you and for your children after you forever,
when you do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 12:29) 
When the Lord your God cuts off the nations before you, whom you are going in to dispossess,
and you have driven them out and settled in their land,

(Deuteronomy 12:30) 
be careful that you are not ensnared by their ways, after they have been destroyed from before you.
Do not inquire about how they worshipped their gods, saying to yourself, 'I will do the same.'

(Deuteronomy 12:31) 
You must not act in that manner toward the Lord your God.
For they have committed against their gods all the abominable practices that the Lord detests,
even burning their own sons and daughters in the fire as offerings.

(Deuteronomy 12:32) 
Everything that I command you, that alone you must do for the Lord your God.
You must not add anything to it, nor take anything away from it.

(Deuteronomy 12:1) 
These are the commands and the judgments that you must obey in the land that the Lord God of your ancestors is about to give you. You are to possess this land and live upon it for as long as you are able.

(Deuteronomy 12:2) 
You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you are about to dispossess have worshipped their gods: on the highest mountains, on the hills, and under every leafy tree.

(Deuteronomy 12:3) 
Tear down their altars, smash their idols, cut down their sacred groves, and burn their carved images with fire. You must erase the very names of their gods from those places.

(Deuteronomy 12:4) 
You must not do anything like this to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 12:5) 
Instead, you must come to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes, to establish His Name there and to dwell there.

(Deuteronomy 12:6) 
There, you are to offer your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor, your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your cattle and your sheep.

(Deuteronomy 12:7) 
And you will eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, and you will rejoice with all that you have accomplished, you and your households, for all the ways in which the Lord your God has blessed you.

(Deuteronomy 12:8) 
You must not do there what we do here today, where each person does whatever seems right in their own eyes.

(Deuteronomy 12:9) 
For up to the present time, you have not yet come to the rest and the possession of the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.

(Deuteronomy 12:10) 
You will cross the Jordan River and dwell in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, so that you may find rest from all your enemies on every side and live without any fear.

(Deuteronomy 12:11) 
In the place that the Lord your God will choose to establish His Name there, you are to bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor, and whatever you have vowed to the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 12:12) 
And you will feast there before the Lord your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who lives within your gates, because he has no portion or inheritance with you.

(Deuteronomy 12:13) 
Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in every place you might see.

(Deuteronomy 12:14) 
But only in the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes are you to offer your burnt offerings, and there you must do all that I command you.

(Deuteronomy 12:15) 
Nevertheless, in every city you may slaughter and eat meat according to all the desire of your soul, from whatever the Lord your God has blessed you with, whether it is ritually clean or ritually unclean. You may eat it as you would a gazelle or a deer.

(Deuteronomy 12:16) 
Only do not eat the blood; instead, you must pour it out upon the ground like water.

(Deuteronomy 12:17) 
You will not be permitted to eat in your towns the tithe of your grain, or your wine, or your oil, nor the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, nor any of the offerings you have vowed, or your freewill offerings, or the firstfruits of your labor.

(Deuteronomy 12:18) 
Instead, you must eat them before the Lord your God in the place that the Lord your God will choose: you, and your son, and your daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levite who dwells in your cities. And you will rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord your God in all that you accomplish.

(Deuteronomy 12:19) 
Be careful not to neglect the Levite at any time while you are dwelling in your land.

(Deuteronomy 12:20) 
When the Lord your God expands your territory, just as He promised you, and you desire to eat meat—whatever your soul longs for—you will then have the permission to slaughter and eat it according to the blessing of the Lord your God, and according to every desire of your soul.

(Deuteronomy 12:21) 
If the place that the Lord your God has chosen to establish His Name there is too far away, you may slaughter from your herds and your flocks, which the Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you. You may eat it in your own cities, according to every desire of your soul.

(Deuteronomy 12:22) 
You may eat from them just as you would eat a gazelle or a deer: both the ritually clean and the ritually unclean alike may partake.

(Deuteronomy 12:23) 
Only be careful not to eat the blood, for the blood is their life, and therefore you must not eat the life with the meat.

(Deuteronomy 12:24) 
You must not eat it, but you are to pour it out on the ground like water.

(Deuteronomy 12:25) 
You must not eat it, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is pleasing before the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 12:26) 
But your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings that you have made to the Lord, you must take and bring to the place that the Lord will choose.

(Deuteronomy 12:27) 
There you will offer your burnt offerings—both the meat and the blood—upon the altar of the Lord your God. You will pour the blood of the sacrifices at the base of the altar, and lay the meat itself upon the altar.

(Deuteronomy 12:28) 
Be diligent to observe and listen to all that I command you, so that it may always go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 12:29) 
When the Lord your God has destroyed before you the nations into whose land you are going to possess, and you have driven them out and settled in their land,

(Deuteronomy 12:30) 
Be careful not to imitate their customs after they have been scattered before you. Do not even inquire how they worshipped their gods, saying to yourself, 'Just as these nations worshipped their gods, so will I worship them too.'

(Deuteronomy 12:31) 
You must not act in this way towards the Lord your God, for they have done to their gods all the abominable practices that the Lord detests, even offering their sons and daughters and burning them with fire.

(Deuteronomy 12:32) 
Everything that I command you, this alone you must do for the Lord your God. You must neither add to it nor take away from it.

(Deuteronomy 13:1) 
If a prophet, or someone who sees visions or has dreams, arises among you and declares a sign or a wonder to you,

(Deuteronomy 13:2) 
and what he said actually happens, and then he says to you, "Let us go and follow other gods, gods you do not know, and let us serve them,"

(Deuteronomy 13:3) 
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. For the Lord your God is testing you, so that it may be clearly seen whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, or not.

(Deuteronomy 13:4) 
You must follow the Lord your God, and you must revere Him, and keep His commands. Listen to His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him.

(Deuteronomy 13:5) 
But that prophet or dreamer, you must put him to death. Because he spoke words to turn you away from the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery. He sought to drive you from the way the Lord your God commanded you, and he would not let you hear God's commands. You must remove this evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 13:6) 
If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife who shares your bed, or your friend whom you love as your own soul, secretly tries to persuade you, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," gods whom neither you nor your fathers have known—

(Deuteronomy 13:7) 
gods of the peoples who are around you, whether they are near or far, from one end of the earth to the other—

(Deuteronomy 13:8) 
you must not agree with him, nor listen to him. Your eye must not show pity for him, you must not spare him, and you must not hide his sin.

(Deuteronomy 13:9) 
Instead, you must immediately put him to death. Your hand shall be the first upon him to kill him, and afterward, the hands of all the people.

(Deuteronomy 13:10) 
Stones shall cover him and bring about his death. This is because he wanted to draw you away from the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.

(Deuteronomy 13:11) 
So that all of Israel, hearing about this, may fear and never again do anything of this kind.

(Deuteronomy 13:12) 
If you hear in one of your cities, which the Lord your God is giving you to inhabit, some people saying,

(Deuteronomy 13:13) 
"Worthless men—literally 'sons of Belial'—have gone out from among you and have turned away the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods whom you have not known,'"

(Deuteronomy 13:14) 
then you must inquire, investigate diligently, and ask about every detail with the utmost truthfulness. If it is certain, and the detestable act is proven true among you,

(Deuteronomy 13:15) 
you must immediately strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, and you must utterly destroy it, and all that is in it, even its livestock.

(Deuteronomy 13:16) 
And all the plunder of that city you shall gather into the middle of its open square and burn the city with all its goods as a complete offering to the Lord your God. It shall remain a perpetual mound of ruins and shall never be built again.

(Deuteronomy 13:17) 
Let nothing of the cursed thing cling to your hand, so that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers,

(Deuteronomy 13:18) 
if you listen to the voice of the Lord your God and keep all His commandments which I command you today, to do what is right in the sight of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 14:1) 
You are truly children of the Lord your God. Therefore, you must not cut yourselves, nor must you shave your heads as a sign of mourning for the dead.

(Deuteronomy 14:2) 
This is because you are a holy people, belonging to the Lord your God. The Lord chose you specifically to be His own treasured people, distinct from all other nations on the face of the earth.

(Deuteronomy 14:3) 
You must not eat anything that is an abomination.

(Deuteronomy 14:4) 
These are the animals you may eat: an ox, a sheep, and a goat.

(Deuteronomy 14:5) 
Also, you may eat the deer, the roe deer, the wild ox, the tragelaphus (a type of mountain goat or antelope), the oryx, the giraffe, and the bison.

(Deuteronomy 14:6) 
You may eat every animal that has a completely split hoof and that also chews the cud.

(Deuteronomy 14:7) 
However, among those that chew the cud or have a split hoof, you must not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, their hooves are not fully divided, making them unclean for you.

(Deuteronomy 14:8) 
Also, the pig is unclean for you. Though it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You must not eat their meat, and you must not touch their dead bodies.

(Deuteronomy 14:9) 
From all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat these: anything that has both fins and scales.

(Deuteronomy 14:10) 
But anything that does not have both fins and scales, you must not eat, because it is unclean.

(Deuteronomy 14:11) 
You may eat all clean birds.

(Deuteronomy 14:12) 
However, you must not eat these birds: the eagle, the griffon vulture, and the sea eagle.

(Deuteronomy 14:13) 
Also the kite, and all kinds of vultures.

(Deuteronomy 14:14) 
And every kind of raven.

(Deuteronomy 14:15) 
Also the ostrich, the horned owl, the seagull, and every kind of hawk.

(Deuteronomy 14:16) 
The little owl, the ibis, and the swan.

(Deuteronomy 14:17) 
The night heron, the cormorant, and all kinds of raven.

(Deuteronomy 14:18) 
Also the heron, and all kinds of plover, as well as the hoopoe and the bat.

(Deuteronomy 14:19) 
Furthermore, every winged insect that also crawls on the ground will be unclean for you, and it must not be eaten.

(Deuteronomy 14:20) 
You may eat anything that is clean.

(Deuteronomy 14:21) 
You must not eat any animal that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner who lives within your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a non-Israelite. This is because you are a holy people, belonging to the Lord your God. Also, you must never boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

(Deuteronomy 14:22) 
You must set aside a tithe—a tenth—of all the produce from your fields that grows each year in the land.

(Deuteronomy 14:23) 
You must eat this tithe—your tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep—in the presence of the Lord your God, at the specific place He will choose for His Name to be invoked. This practice will teach you to revere the Lord your God at all times.

(Deuteronomy 14:24) 
If the journey is too long for you, and the place the Lord your God has chosen is very far away, so that you cannot carry your tithe there—or if the distance makes it impractical to transport it directly—

(Deuteronomy 14:25) 
then you may convert all of your tithes into money. Tie the silver or gold securely in your hand, and travel to the place the Lord your God has chosen.

(Deuteronomy 14:26) 
With that money, you may buy whatever you desire: cattle, sheep, wine, or strong drink, or anything else your heart longs for. You are to eat and drink there in the presence of the Lord your God, and you and your entire household are to rejoice together.

(Deuteronomy 14:27) 
Be sure not to neglect the Levite who lives within your towns, because he does not have an inherited portion or land ownership among you.

(Deuteronomy 14:28) 
At the end of every three years, you must bring out the entire tithe of your produce from that year and store it within your towns.

(Deuteronomy 14:29) 
Then the Levite, who has no inherited portion or land with you, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your towns, will come and eat until they are satisfied. Do this so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you undertake.

(Deuteronomy 14:1) 
You are children of the Lord your God, so you must not wound yourselves or shave your heads for the dead.

(Deuteronomy 14:2) 
Because you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and He has chosen you to be His own special people from all the nations on earth.

(Deuteronomy 14:3) 
Do not eat anything that is detestable.

(Deuteronomy 14:4) 
These are the animals you are permitted to eat: an ox, a sheep, and a goat,

(Deuteronomy 14:5) 
a stag, a gazelle, a roebuck, a wild goat, an ibex, a wild ox, and a chamois.

(Deuteronomy 14:6) 
You may eat any animal that has a completely split hoof and chews the cud.

(Deuteronomy 14:7) 
But among those that chew the cud or have a split hoof but not both, you must not eat these: the camel, the rabbit, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not have a completely split hoof. They are unclean for you.

(Deuteronomy 14:8) 
The pig is also unclean for you, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud. You must not eat their meat or touch their dead bodies.

(Deuteronomy 14:9) 
From all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat everything that has fins and scales.

(Deuteronomy 14:10) 
But anything that does not have fins and scales you must not eat, because it is unclean for you.

(Deuteronomy 14:11) 
You may eat all birds that are clean.

(Deuteronomy 14:12) 
But these are the birds you must not eat: the eagle, the vulture, and the osprey,

(Deuteronomy 14:13) 
the kite, the falcon, and any kind of buzzard or kite,

(Deuteronomy 14:14) 
and any kind of raven,

(Deuteronomy 14:15) 
the ostrich, the screech owl, the seagull, and any kind of hawk,

(Deuteronomy 14:16) 
the little owl, the great owl, and the swan,

(Deuteronomy 14:17) 
the pelican, the cormorant, and the purple heron,

(Deuteronomy 14:18) 
the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.

(Deuteronomy 14:19) 
All winged insects that crawl on the ground are unclean for you and must not be eaten.

(Deuteronomy 14:20) 
You may eat all other clean winged creatures.

(Deuteronomy 14:21) 
Do not eat anything that dies naturally. You may give it to a foreigner living within your city gates to eat, or you may sell it to a non-Israelite, because you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

(Deuteronomy 14:22) 
You must set aside a tithe—one tenth—of all the produce that grows annually from your fields.

(Deuteronomy 14:23) 
And you shall eat your tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, in the presence of the Lord your God at the special place He chooses to make His name dwell there. You shall do this so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always.

(Deuteronomy 14:24) 
But if the journey is too far for you, and the special place the Lord your God chooses is too distant for you to carry your tithe, because the Lord your God has blessed you abundantly and the amount is too great,

(Deuteronomy 14:25) 
then you may sell your produce, take the money with you, and go to the special place the Lord your God chooses.

(Deuteronomy 14:26) 
With that money, you may buy anything you desire—cattle, sheep, wine, or strong drink—and you and your household shall eat and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 14:27) 
And do not neglect the Levite who lives within your city gates, because he has no share or inheritance of land among you.

(Deuteronomy 14:28) 
At the end of every third year, you must bring out the tithe—one tenth—of all your produce from that year and store it within your city gates.

(Deuteronomy 14:29) 
Then the Levite, who has no share or inheritance of land among you, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your city gates, may come and eat and be satisfied. Do this so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to.

(Deuteronomy 15:1) 
Every seven years, you must bring about a complete release of all debts—this is the Sabbatical year, for the forgiveness of debts.

(Deuteronomy 15:2) 
And this is the specific rule for that debt release: Every creditor who has lent anything to his debtor must release it. He is not to demand repayment from his debtor, for it is the Lord's designated time for debt release.

(Deuteronomy 15:3) 
You may demand payment from a foreigner and a sojourner, but from your own Hebrew kinsman and neighbor, you must not demand back what you have lent.

(Deuteronomy 15:4) 
This is to happen, unless it so happens that there is no needy person among you—for the Lord your God will bless you abundantly in the land He is about to give you as your inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 15:5) 
Provided, however, that you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God and diligently keep all His commandments which I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 15:6) 
Then the Lord your God will bless you, just as He promised. And you will lend money to many nations, but you yourself will not need to borrow from anyone; you will rule over many nations, but no one will rule over you.

(Deuteronomy 15:7) 
If, however, there is ever a poor person among your kinsmen within any of your towns in the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not harden your heart or close your hand to him.

(Deuteronomy 15:8) 
Instead, you must generously open your hand to him and lend him whatever he needs, according to his necessity.

(Deuteronomy 15:9) 
Be careful that you do not secretly harbor any wicked thought and say in your heart: 'The seventh year, the year of debt release, is drawing near.' And then you turn your eyes away from the poor, and refuse to lend him anything. Beware that he does not cry out against you to the Lord, and it become a sin for you.

(Deuteronomy 15:10) 
Instead, you must give to him; and do so without a grudging spirit, so that you may relieve him in his needs. For because of this very thing, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything your hand undertakes.

(Deuteronomy 15:11) 
For the poor will never cease to exist in your land. Therefore, I command you and say: You must open your hand generously to your brother, to the needy, and to the poor who live with you in the land.

(Deuteronomy 15:12) 
If your Hebrew brother or sister sells himself or herself to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year, you must set them free.

(Deuteronomy 15:13) 
And when you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed.

(Deuteronomy 15:14) 
Instead, you must provide generously for him from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress, with which the Lord your God has helped you.

(Deuteronomy 15:15) 
Remember that you yourselves were also enslaved in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God delivered you. Therefore, I am giving you this commandment today.

(Deuteronomy 15:16) 
But if they do not wish to leave, and answer, 'I will not leave, because I love you and your household, and I am content with you,' then this is what you must do.

(Deuteronomy 15:17) 
You shall then take an awl and pierce their ear through the door of your house, and they will be your servant forever. You shall do the same for your female servant also.

(Deuteronomy 15:18) 
Do not consider it a hardship to set them free from you, for they have served you for six years, having earned double the wages of a hired worker. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.

(Deuteronomy 15:19) 
All the firstborn males that are born from your herds and your flocks—whatever is male, you must consecrate to the Lord your God. You shall not put the firstborn calves to work, nor shall you shear the firstborn lambs.

(Deuteronomy 15:20) 
You and your household shall eat them each year in the presence of the Lord your God, in the specific place that the Lord chooses.

(Deuteronomy 15:21) 
But if the animal has a defect—if it is lame, or blind, or has any other serious blemish—you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 15:22) 
Instead, you may eat it within your own towns, both the ritually unclean and the clean among you, just as one would eat a gazelle or a deer.

(Deuteronomy 15:23) 
You must only be careful not to eat their blood; instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.

(Deuteronomy 15:1) 
In the seventh year, you are to enact the year of release—this is the Sabbatical year for cancelling debts.

(Deuteronomy 15:2) 
This is how the year of release is to be observed: Every creditor who has lent money to his neighbor must not demand its repayment from his fellow Israelite. This is because it is the Lord's designated year for releasing debts.

(Deuteronomy 15:3) 
From a foreigner, you may still demand repayment. But from your fellow Israelite, you must not demand what is owed to you.

(Deuteronomy 15:4) 
And there should be no poor among you—provided you fully obey the Lord your God, He will bless you in the land He is about to give you as your inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 15:5) 
This will only happen if you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God and diligently keep all His commandments that I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 15:6) 
The Lord your God will truly bless you, just as He has promised. You will lend to many nations, but you yourselves will never need to borrow from anyone. You will rule over many nations, and no one will ever rule over you.

(Deuteronomy 15:7) 
If one of your fellow Israelites living within the gates of your city—in the land the Lord your God is about to give you—becomes poor, you must not harden your heart or close your hand against the needy person.

(Deuteronomy 15:8) 
Instead, you must open your hand generously to him and lend him whatever he needs to fully satisfy his needs.

(Deuteronomy 15:9) 
Be careful that no evil thought creeps into your mind, leading you to say in your heart: 'The seventh year—the year of release—is approaching,' and then you turn your eyes away from your poor Israelite brother, unwilling to lend him anything. If you do this, he will cry out to the Lord against you, and it will be counted as a sin for you.

(Deuteronomy 15:10) 
Instead, you must give to him, and do so cheerfully and without reluctance. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you do with your hands.

(Deuteronomy 15:11) 
For there will always be poor people in the land. That is why I am commanding you to open your hand generously to your needy Israelite brother and to the poor who dwell with you in the land.

(Deuteronomy 15:12) 
If your fellow Hebrew man or woman sells himself or herself to you as a servant and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year, you must set them free.

(Deuteronomy 15:13) 
When you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed.

(Deuteronomy 15:14) 
Instead, you must provide generously for them from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress—from all the ways the Lord your God has blessed you.

(Deuteronomy 15:15) 
Remember that you yourselves were once slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God freed you. That is why I am giving you this commandment today.

(Deuteronomy 15:16) 
But if the servant says to you, 'I do not want to leave,' because he loves you and your household, and he is well off with you,

(Deuteronomy 15:17) 
Then you must take an awl and pierce his ear through the door—this is a sign of his permanent commitment. He will then serve you for the remainder of his life. You must do the same for your female servant.

(Deuteronomy 15:18) 
It should not seem burdensome to you when you set them free, because for six years they served you for twice the wage of a hired worker. If you follow these commands, the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.

(Deuteronomy 15:19) 
You must consecrate all the firstborn males born to your cattle and your flock to the Lord your God. You must not use the firstborn of your bulls for work, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.

(Deuteronomy 15:20) 
Each year, you and your household must eat them before the Lord your God in the special place that the Lord chooses for His worship.

(Deuteronomy 15:21) 
However, if there is any blemish in the animal—if it is lame, or blind, or has any serious defect—you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 15:22) 
Instead, you may eat it within your own city gates, just as you would any other meat, whether it comes from a ritually clean or unclean animal.

(Deuteronomy 15:23) 
Only be sure not to eat its blood, but pour it out on the ground like water, as a sign of respect for life.

(Deuteronomy 16:1) 
Observe the month of fresh crops —the first month of the religious year, Abib— and celebrate the Passover solemnity to the Lord your God. For in this very month, the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night.

(Deuteronomy 16:2) 
And you shall offer the Passover sacrifice to the Lord your God from your flocks and herds, in the sacred place which the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell.

(Deuteronomy 16:3) 
You shall not eat anything leavened with it. For seven days, you shall eat unleavened bread —the bread of your affliction— because you came out of Egypt in haste. This is so you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt for all the days of your life.

(Deuteronomy 16:4) 
No leaven shall be found in all your territory for seven days. And none of the meat that was sacrificed in the evening on the first day shall remain until morning.

(Deuteronomy 16:5) 
You will not be permitted to sacrifice the Passover in just any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving to you.

(Deuteronomy 16:6) 
Instead, in the special place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell, there you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening at sunset, at the exact time you came out of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 16:7) 
And you shall cook and eat it in the place which the Lord your God will choose. Then, in the morning, you shall return and go to your tents.

(Deuteronomy 16:8) 
For six days, you shall eat unleavened bread. And on the seventh day, there shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord your God; you shall do no work.

(Deuteronomy 16:9) 
You shall count seven weeks for yourself. From the day you first put the sickle to the standing grain, you shall count seven full weeks.

(Deuteronomy 16:10) 
Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God, bringing a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give according to the blessing that the Lord your God has bestowed upon you.

(Deuteronomy 16:11) 
And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite who lives within your gates, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who reside among you, in the place which the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell.

(Deuteronomy 16:12) 
And remember that you were once a slave in Egypt. You shall therefore keep and do all the things that I have commanded you.

(Deuteronomy 16:13) 
You shall celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles —the Festival of Booths— for seven days, when you have gathered in your produce from your threshing floor and your winepress.

(Deuteronomy 16:14) 
And you shall rejoice in your feast: you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your gates.

(Deuteronomy 16:15) 
For seven days you shall celebrate the feast for the Lord your God in the place which the Lord will choose. And the Lord your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be completely joyful.

(Deuteronomy 16:16) 
Three times in a year, every male among you shall appear before the Lord your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles. No one shall appear empty-handed in the presence of the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 16:17) 
But each one shall offer what he has, according to the blessing of the Lord his God which He has given him.

(Deuteronomy 16:18) 
You shall appoint judges and magistrates in all your gates —that is, in every town— which the Lord your God is giving you, throughout your tribes, so that they may judge the people with righteous judgment.

(Deuteronomy 16:19) 
You shall not show partiality, nor accept bribes. For bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the words of the righteous.

(Deuteronomy 16:20) 
You shall pursue justice, and only justice, so that you may live and possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you.

(Deuteronomy 16:21) 
You shall not plant any sacred tree or grove —used for idol worship— near the altar of the Lord your God, which you shall make for yourself.

(Deuteronomy 16:22) 
Nor shall you erect any sacred pillar or idol, for the Lord your God detests these things.

(Deuteronomy 16:1) 
Observe the month of Abib—the month of new things and the beginning of spring—and you shall celebrate the Passover in honor of the Lord your God, because in this very month of Abib, the Lord your God led you out of Egypt during the night.

(Deuteronomy 16:2) 
Therefore, you shall offer the Passover sacrifice of sheep and oxen to the Lord your God in the specific place the Lord your God will choose for His name to reside there.

(Deuteronomy 16:3) 
You shall not eat any leavened bread with it. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as has been commanded to you. This is the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in great haste. You shall do this so that you may remember the day of your departure from the land of Egypt all the days of your life.

(Deuteronomy 16:4) 
No leaven shall be seen anywhere in all your territory for these seven days. Also, none of the flesh from what was sacrificed on the first evening shall remain until the next morning.

(Deuteronomy 16:5) 
You will not be permitted to sacrifice the Passover lamb in just any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you.

(Deuteronomy 16:6) 
Instead, you must offer the Passover sacrifice in the specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell. There you shall sacrifice the Passover offering in the evening, at sunset, the very time you departed from Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 16:7) 
You shall cook and eat it in the place the Lord your God will choose. Then, in the morning, you may return and go to your own tents or homes.

(Deuteronomy 16:8) 
For six days you shall eat unleavened bread. But on the seventh day, because it is a solemn assembly for the Lord your God, you shall not do any work.

(Deuteronomy 16:9) 
You shall count seven full weeks for yourself, beginning from the day you first put the sickle to the standing grain—from that day you shall count seven weeks.

(Deuteronomy 16:10) 
Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God, offering a spontaneous gift from your hand, which you shall give to the Lord your God in proportion to the blessing He has given you.

(Deuteronomy 16:11) 
And you shall feast before the Lord your God—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite who lives within your gates, and the foreign resident, the orphan, and the widow who live with you—all in the place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell there.

(Deuteronomy 16:12) 
And remember that you were once slaves in Egypt. Therefore, you shall carefully observe and do these specific commands.

(Deuteronomy 16:13) 
You shall celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days, after you have gathered in the harvest from your threshing floor and your winepress.

(Deuteronomy 16:14) 
You shall rejoice in your feast—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite, the foreign resident, the orphan, and the widow who live within your gates.

(Deuteronomy 16:15) 
For seven days you shall keep the feast for the Lord your God in the place the Lord will choose, because the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, so you will be entirely full of joy.

(Deuteronomy 16:16) 
Three times a year, all your males shall appear before the Lord your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles. No one shall appear empty-handed before the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 16:17) 
Instead, each person shall offer what they are able to give, in proportion to the blessing that the Lord their God has bestowed upon them.

(Deuteronomy 16:18) 
You shall appoint judges and officials in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, throughout all your tribes. These officials are to judge the people with righteous judgments.

(Deuteronomy 16:19) 
They shall not be swayed to one side or another. You shall not show partiality to anyone, nor accept bribes, because bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the words of the righteous.

(Deuteronomy 16:20) 
You shall wholeheartedly pursue only what is just and right, so that you may live and possess the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

(Deuteronomy 16:21) 
You shall not plant any sacred pole or any tree of worship beside the altar of the Lord your God that you will build for yourself.

(Deuteronomy 16:22) 
Nor shall you set up for yourself any sacred stone pillar, for these practices are detestable to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 17:1) 
You must not offer to the Lord your God any ox or sheep that has a blemish or any other defect. For such an offering is detestable to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 17:2) 
If there is found among you, in one of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you to dwell in, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God and breaks His covenant with you—

(Deuteronomy 17:3) 
by going and serving other gods and worshipping them—whether it be the sun, or the moon, or any of the celestial bodies in the sky—which I have not commanded you to do or to worship.

(Deuteronomy 17:4) 
And if this is reported to you, and you hear of it, then you must inquire diligently into the matter. If it is found to be true, and such a detestable thing has indeed occurred within the land of Israel,

(Deuteronomy 17:5) 
you shall bring out that man or that woman who has committed such an evil and wicked act to the gates of your city, and they shall be stoned to death with rocks.

(Deuteronomy 17:6) 
At the testimony of two or three witnesses, the person who is to be put to death shall die; no one shall be executed on the testimony of a single witness against him.

(Deuteronomy 17:7) 
The hands of the witnesses shall be the first to cast stones against him, in order to execute him, and afterward the hands of all the people. In this way, you shall purge this evil from among you and your community.

(Deuteronomy 17:8) 
If you find that judgment is too difficult and ambiguous for you in a legal case—whether it be a dispute between blood and blood (concerning murder), or cause and cause (a legal claim), or leprosy and leprosy (a ritual purity question)—and you see that the words of judgment vary within your gates;

(Deuteronomy 17:9) 
then you shall arise and go up to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose to establish His presence and authority.

(Deuteronomy 17:10) 
You shall then come to the priests of the Levitical lineage and to the judge who is serving at that time. You shall inquire of them, and they will declare to you the truth of the judgment and the proper decision.

(Deuteronomy 17:11) 
And you shall do whatever they tell you, those who preside over the place which the Lord has chosen, and whatever they teach you according to His law. You shall follow their judgment and not turn aside from their decision, neither to the right hand nor to the left.

(Deuteronomy 17:12) 
But the person who acts with arrogance, refusing to obey the command of the priest who ministers there at that time before the Lord your God, or the judgment of the judge—that person shall die. You shall thus purge this evil from Israel.

(Deuteronomy 17:13) 
And all the people who hear of it will be struck with fear, and they will never again act with such arrogance or disregard for authority.

(Deuteronomy 17:14) 
When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you possess it and live in it, and then you say in your hearts: 'I will set a king over me, just as all the nations around me have kings'—

(Deuteronomy 17:15) 
you may indeed appoint as king over you the one whom the Lord your God will choose from among your own brothers. You may not place a foreigner, who is not one of your own brothers, as king over you.

(Deuteronomy 17:16) 
But once he is appointed, he must not acquire many horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to obtain more horses for his military strength—especially since the Lord has commanded you that you must never again return by that way to Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 17:17) 
He must not acquire many wives for himself, lest they turn his heart away from God and His commandments. Nor must he accumulate for himself excessive amounts of silver and gold.

(Deuteronomy 17:18) 
But after he takes his place on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law—this Book of Deuteronomy—in a scroll, taking the exemplar directly from the priests of the Levitical tribe.

(Deuteronomy 17:19) 
He shall keep this copy with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and to carefully observe all the words and statutes of this law that are commanded in it.

(Deuteronomy 17:20) 
In this way, his heart will not be lifted up in pride above his brothers, and he will not turn aside from these commandments, either to the right or to the left. This is so that he and his sons may reign for a long time over Israel.

(Deuteronomy 17:1) 
You shall not sacrifice to the Lord your God any ox or sheep that has a blemish or any defect, because such an offering would be an abomination to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 17:2) 
If a man or woman is found among you, in any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you, who does evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and has transgressed His covenant,

(Deuteronomy 17:3) 
so that they go and serve other gods and worship them—whether the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of the sky—

(Deuteronomy 17:4) 
and if this has been reported to you, and when you hear of it, you inquire diligently, and you find it to be true, and such an abomination has been committed in Israel,

(Deuteronomy 17:5) 
then you shall bring out that man or woman who committed this wicked deed to the gates of your city, and they shall be stoned to death.

(Deuteronomy 17:6) 
At the mouth of two or three witnesses, the one who is to be put to death shall die; no one shall be executed on the testimony of a single witness against them.

(Deuteronomy 17:7) 
The hands of the witnesses shall be the first upon them to put them to death, and afterward the hands of all the people, so that you may remove the evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 17:8) 
If you perceive that a judgment is too difficult and ambiguous for you—concerning matters of bloodshed, or legal cases, or leprosy cases—and you see that the words of the judges within your gates are varying,

(Deuteronomy 17:9) 
then rise and go up to the place that the Lord your God will choose;

(Deuteronomy 17:10) 
and you shall come to the Levitical priests and to the judge who will be in office at that time. You shall inquire of them, and they will declare to you the truth of the judgment.

(Deuteronomy 17:11) 
And you shall do whatever they tell you, those who preside in the place that the Lord will choose, and whatever they teach you according to His law;

(Deuteronomy 17:12) 
and you shall follow their ruling, and you shall not deviate from it to the right or to the left.

(Deuteronomy 17:13) 
But if anyone acts presumptuously, unwilling to obey the command of the priest who ministers to the Lord your God at that time, or the ruling of the judge, that man shall die. So you shall remove the evil from Israel.

(Deuteronomy 17:14) 
And all the people shall hear and fear, and never again shall they swell with pride.

(Deuteronomy 17:15) 
When you have entered the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it, and dwell in it, and you say, "I will set a king over me, just as all the nations around me have,"

(Deuteronomy 17:16) 
you shall surely appoint as king over you the one whom the Lord your God will choose from among your brothers. You may not set a man of another nation over you as king, who is not your brother.

(Deuteronomy 17:17) 
He shall not acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he lead the people back to Egypt to increase his cavalry, especially since the Lord has commanded you never to return by that way again.

(Deuteronomy 17:18) 
He shall not have many wives, who might entice his heart away, nor shall he accumulate immense quantities of silver and gold.

(Deuteronomy 17:19) 
And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall take a copy of this law, written for himself, from the Levitical priests;

(Deuteronomy 17:20) 
he shall keep it with him and read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and diligently keep all the words and ceremonies of this law which are commanded.

(Deuteronomy 18:1) 
The priests, the Levites, and all those from the tribe of Levi, will not have a portion or an inheritance among the other tribes of Israel; instead, they shall live on the offerings and sacrifices made to the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 18:2) 
They shall not receive any other property from their brothers, the other tribes of Israel, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance and their possession, just as He promised them.

(Deuteronomy 18:3) 
This is the customary right of the priests from the people who offer sacrifices: whether they sacrifice an ox or a sheep, they shall give the priest the shoulder, both cheeks, and the stomach.

(Deuteronomy 18:4) 
They shall give the priest the first-fruits of their grain, their wine, and their olive oil, and the first sheared wool from their sheep.

(Deuteronomy 18:5) 
For the Lord your God has chosen the tribe of Levi from all your tribes, so that they may stand to serve and minister in the name of the Lord, both they and their descendants forever.

(Deuteronomy 18:6) 
If a Levite leaves one of your cities, wherever he may be living in any part of Israel, and he desires to come to the place which the Lord will choose for His worship,

(Deuteronomy 18:7) 
he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, just like all his fellow Levite brothers who are standing there at that time before the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 18:8) 
He shall receive the same portion of food and offerings as them, apart from what he already possesses from the sale of his ancestral property or his dwelling in his hometown.

(Deuteronomy 18:9) 
When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, be careful not to imitate the detestable practices of those nations already living there.

(Deuteronomy 18:10) 
Let no one be found among you who offers their son or daughter as a sacrifice by fire, nor anyone who consults oracles, or practices divination, or interprets omens, or observes dreams, or is a sorcerer,

(Deuteronomy 18:11) 
nor one who casts spells, nor one who consults spirits of the dead (necromancers), nor a diviner, nor one who seeks answers from the deceased.

(Deuteronomy 18:12) 
For all who do these things are detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices, He will drive those nations out before you as you enter the land.

(Deuteronomy 18:13) 
You shall be blameless and wholehearted in your relationship with the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 18:14) 
These nations whose land you are about to possess listen to diviners and those who interpret omens. But the Lord your God has not permitted you to do such things, having given you a different teaching.

(Deuteronomy 18:15) 
The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your own people, from your brothers, just like me—Moses. You must listen to Him.

(Deuteronomy 18:16) 
This is exactly what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb when the assembly was gathered, and you said, 'Let me not hear the voice of the Lord my God again, nor see this great fire anymore, lest I die!'

(Deuteronomy 18:17) 
And the Lord said to me, 'What they have said is good and correct.'

(Deuteronomy 18:18) 
'I will raise up for them a Prophet from among their brothers, one like you, Moses. I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them everything that I command Him.'

(Deuteronomy 18:19) 
'But whoever will not listen to His words, which He speaks in My name, I Myself will hold that person accountable.'

(Deuteronomy 18:20) 
However, any prophet who, out of pride, presumes to speak a word in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall be put to death.

(Deuteronomy 18:21) 
If you should ask yourself, 'How will we know if a message is truly from the Lord or not?'

(Deuteronomy 18:22) 
You will have this sign: If what the prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not come true or if his message is confused and contradictory, then the Lord has not spoken it. Instead, the prophet has spoken it out of pride and presumption. Therefore, you need not fear him nor heed his words.

(Deuteronomy 18:1) 
The Levitical priests, and indeed all men who are from that same tribe of Levi, will not be allowed to have an allotted portion of land or an inheritance among the rest of the people of Israel. Instead, they will live by eating from the sacrifices offered to the Lord and from His offerings.

(Deuteronomy 18:2) 
They shall not receive anything else from the possessions of their Israelite brothers, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance, just as He promised them.

(Deuteronomy 18:3) 
This is what the priests have a right to receive from the people, and from those who offer sacrifices: whether they sacrifice a bull or a sheep, they will give the priest the shoulder, both of the jaws, and the stomach.

(Deuteronomy 18:4) 
They shall also receive the first fruits of the grain, the wine, and the oil, along with the first shearings of the sheep's wool for their own use.

(Deuteronomy 18:5) 
For the Lord your God has specifically chosen him, from all your tribes, to stand and to serve in the Name of the Lord, both he and his sons forever.

(Deuteronomy 18:6) 
If a Levite comes out of one of your cities, from any part of Israel where he has been living, and he comes to the place which the Lord has chosen to establish His presence,

(Deuteronomy 18:7) 
then he shall serve in the Name of the Lord his God, just like all his fellow Levite brothers who stand there at that time before the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 18:8) 
He will receive the same portion of food as they do, apart from what he has inherited from his family's city.

(Deuteronomy 18:9) 
When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, be careful not to imitate the detestable practices of those pagan nations.

(Deuteronomy 18:10) 
Let no one be found among you who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who consults diviners, or one who observes omens and auguries, nor any sorcerer,

(Deuteronomy 18:11) 
nor one who casts spells, nor one who consults spirits, nor a fortuneteller, nor one who seeks truth from the dead.

(Deuteronomy 18:12) 
For the Lord detests all these practices, and it is because of such crimes that He will destroy these nations before you when you enter the land.

(Deuteronomy 18:13) 
You shall be perfect and without blemish before the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 18:14) 
These nations, whose land you are about to possess, listen to soothsayers and diviners; but you, however, have a different teaching from the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 18:15) 
The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your own people, from your brothers, just like me—Moses is speaking here. You shall listen to Him.

(Deuteronomy 18:16) 
This is exactly what you requested from the Lord your God at Horeb, when the assembly was gathered, and you said: "Let me no longer hear the voice of the Lord my God, and let me not see this immense fire any longer, lest I die."

(Deuteronomy 18:17) 
And the Lord said to me, "They have spoken well in all they said."

(Deuteronomy 18:18) 
"I will raise up a Prophet for them from among their brothers, just like you, and I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them everything that I command Him."

(Deuteronomy 18:19) 
"But whoever will not listen to the words that He speaks in My Name, I Myself will take vengeance upon him."

(Deuteronomy 18:20) 
"However, a prophet who, revealing pride, presumes to speak words in My Name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of foreign gods, that prophet shall be put to death."

(Deuteronomy 18:21) 
If you think in your heart: "How can I know which word the Lord has not spoken?"

(Deuteronomy 18:22) 
This is the sign you will have: If a prophet, speaking in the Name of the Lord, predicts something and that thing does not happen, that is a word which the Lord has not spoken. Rather, the prophet uttered it out of his own proud spirit. Therefore, you shall not be afraid of him.

(Deuteronomy 19:1) 
When the Lord your God completely destroys the nations from the land He is giving to you, and when you have taken possession of their land and settled in their cities and homes,

(Deuteronomy 19:2) 
then you are to designate three cities in the middle of your land—the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 19:3) 
You must make the roads to these cities clear and maintain them, and you shall divide the entire territory of your land, which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance, into three districts. These three cities of refuge will be distributed among these districts.

(Deuteronomy 19:4) 
This is the law for a slayer who will flee to one of these cities and live: anyone who strikes his neighbor accidentally, without any prior malice or hatred towards him,

(Deuteronomy 19:5) 
For example, if someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings the ax to fell a tree, the ax head accidentally flies off the handle, slips from his hand, and strikes his neighbor, killing him—such a person may flee to one of these cities of refuge and live.

(Deuteronomy 19:6) 
Otherwise, the avenger of the slain, burning with rage, might pursue him and overtake him on the road, striking him dead. This would be a grave injustice, as the person is not deserving of death because he had no prior malice or hatred towards the one he accidentally killed.

(Deuteronomy 19:7) 
Therefore, I command you to designate these three cities for yourselves.

(Deuteronomy 19:8) 
And when the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land He promised them,

(Deuteronomy 19:9) 
(This will happen only if you are careful to obey all these commandments and do what I am instructing you today, which is to love the Lord your God and walk in His ways at all times.)

(Deuteronomy 19:10) 
then you must add three more cities of refuge to these, making the total number six, to double the initial three cities.

(Deuteronomy 19:11) 
This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus make you guilty of bloodshed.

(Deuteronomy 19:12) 
But if someone, driven by hatred for his neighbor, lies in wait, ambushes him, and strikes him dead, and then flees to one of these cities of refuge,

(Deuteronomy 19:13) 
then the elders of his own city must send for him, seize him from the city of refuge, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, who will ensure he is put to death.

(Deuteronomy 19:14) 
You must not move your neighbor's boundary markers, which were set by your ancestors in the land you will possess—the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 19:15) 
A single witness is not sufficient to condemn anyone for any crime or wrongdoing. Every charge must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

(Deuteronomy 19:16) 
If a malicious witness comes forward and testifies falsely against another person, accusing him of a transgression or a crime,

(Deuteronomy 19:17) 
then both individuals involved in the dispute must stand before the Lord, in the presence of the priests and judges who are serving at that time.

(Deuteronomy 19:18) 
The judges must investigate the matter thoroughly. If they find that the witness is indeed false and has lied against his fellow Israelite,

(Deuteronomy 19:19) 
then you shall do to him exactly what he intended to do to his brother. In this way, you will purge that evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 19:20) 
The others will hear of this judgment and be struck with fear, ensuring that such evil acts are not committed again in your midst.

(Deuteronomy 19:21) 
Show no pity. The rule shall be: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.

(Deuteronomy 20:1) 
When you go out to fight your enemies, and you see their large armies with many horses and chariots, don't be afraid of them. The Lord your God is with you, the very God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 20:2) 
When you are about to go into battle, a priest will stand nearby and speak to the people.

(Deuteronomy 20:3) 
He will say to them: 'Listen, O Israel! Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be faint of heart. Do not be afraid, do not panic, and do not be terrified by them.'

(Deuteronomy 20:4) 
Because the Lord your God is right there with you, and He Himself will fight on your behalf against your adversaries.

(Deuteronomy 20:5) 
After the priest has finished speaking, the officers will then say to the people: 'Is there any man here who has built a new house and has not yet dedicated it? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle, and another man dedicates his house instead.'

(Deuteronomy 20:6) 
'Is there any man here who has planted a vineyard and has not yet enjoyed its first harvest? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle and another man gets to enjoy his first harvest.'

(Deuteronomy 20:7) 
'Is there any man here who has become engaged to a woman but has not yet married her? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle and another man marries her.'

(Deuteronomy 20:8) 
The officers will then add this instruction and speak to the people: 'Is there any man here who is afraid and faint-hearted? Let him return home now, so that his brothers' hearts do not also become afraid and tremble like his own.'

(Deuteronomy 20:9) 
Once everyone has heard these instructions and is ready for battle, then you must appoint officers: commanders over thousands, commanders over hundreds, and other leaders for the army.

(Deuteronomy 20:10) 
When you approach a city to attack it, you must first offer it terms of peace.

(Deuteronomy 20:11) 
If the city agrees to accept your terms and opens its gates to you, then all the people who live in it will be spared, and they will serve you as forced laborers, paying tribute.

(Deuteronomy 20:12) 
But if the city refuses to make peace with you and instead chooses to wage war, then you must lay siege to it.

(Deuteronomy 20:13) 
And when the Lord your God delivers that city into your hand, you must strike down every male in it with the edge of the sword.

(Deuteronomy 20:14) 
However, you may take for yourselves the women, the young children, the livestock, and all other belongings found in the city as plunder. You are permitted to use these spoils of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given to you.

(Deuteronomy 20:15) 
This is how you must deal with all the cities that are located very far from you. These are the cities that are not among those you are destined to conquer and claim as your permanent land.

(Deuteronomy 20:16) 
However, in the cities within the land that the Lord your God is giving to you as an inheritance, you must not allow anything that breathes to remain alive.

(Deuteronomy 20:17) 
Instead, you must utterly destroy these peoples—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—just as the Lord your God has commanded you.

(Deuteronomy 20:18) 
Otherwise, they will teach you to imitate all the abominable practices that they perform for their idols, and you will then sin against the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 20:19) 
When you lay siege to a city for a long time, surrounding it with fortifications in order to capture it, do not cut down its fruit-bearing trees. You must not use an axe to destroy them, for a tree provides wood and food, and it is not a human being who can fight against you in battle.

(Deuteronomy 20:20) 
However, if there is a tree that is not a fruit-bearing tree, but a wild tree that is suitable for building, you may cut it down. Use these trees to construct siege engines and other works until the city is captured.

(Deuteronomy 20:1) 
When you go out to battle against your enemies, and you see that they have many horses and chariots, and a greater army than you do, do not be afraid of them. For the Lord your God is with you—the same God who led you out from the land of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 20:2) 
When the battle is about to begin, the priest shall step forward before the battle lines and speak to the people, saying:

(Deuteronomy 20:3) 
Listen, O Israel! Today you are going out to fight against your enemies. Let your hearts not be afraid, do not fear, do not yield, and do not be terrified by them.

(Deuteronomy 20:4) 
Because the Lord your God is in your midst, and He Himself will fight for you against your adversaries.

(Deuteronomy 20:5) 
Then the officers in the army shall proclaim in a loud voice, so that the people can hear: "Has anyone built a new house but not yet dedicated it? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man dedicate it."

(Deuteronomy 20:6) 
 "Has anyone planted a vineyard but not yet harvested its fruit? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man harvest it."

(Deuteronomy 20:7) 
 "Has anyone become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man marry her."

(Deuteronomy 20:8) 
And the officers shall add, speaking further to the people: "Who is a man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his home, lest he fill the hearts of his brothers with terror and make them afraid too."

(Deuteronomy 20:9) 
When all these announcements have been made and the people have been commanded to prepare for battle, then the leaders of the companies shall lead the army.

(Deuteronomy 20:10) 
When you approach a city to attack it, you shall first offer it terms of peace.

(Deuteronomy 20:11) 
If the city accepts your offer and opens its gates to you, then all the people who are in it shall become your servants and pay tribute to you.

(Deuteronomy 20:12) 
But if it refuses to make peace and a treaty with you, and begins to wage war against you, then you shall besiege it.

(Deuteronomy 20:13) 
And when the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike down every male within it with the edge of the sword.

(Deuteronomy 20:14) 
But the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the city—all its plunder—you shall take for yourselves. You may eat the spoils of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given to you.

(Deuteronomy 20:15) 
This is what you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, and which are not among the cities you are about to receive as your own possession.

(Deuteronomy 20:16) 
However, concerning these cities that are given to you as a possession—the ones within the promised land—you shall not let anyone remain alive who breathes.

(Deuteronomy 20:17) 
Instead, you must utterly destroy them with the edge of the sword: the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you.

(Deuteronomy 20:18) 
Do this so that they may not teach you to imitate their idolatrous practices, and thereby cause you to sin against the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 20:19) 
When you besiege a city for a long time, surrounding it with fortifications in order to capture it, you shall not cut down its fruit trees, nor lay waste to the region with an axe. For the tree is wood, not a man, and therefore it cannot fight against you.

(Deuteronomy 20:20) 
But if there is a tree that is not a fruit-bearing tree, but a wild tree suitable for work—meaning it produces timber—you may cut it down and use it to build siege works until you capture the city that is fighting against you.

(Deuteronomy 21:1) 
If a man is found murdered in the land that the Lord your God will give you to possess, lying dead in the open fields, and the identity of the one who struck him dead is unknown:

(Deuteronomy 21:2) 
Then your elders and judges must go out and measure the distance from where the corpse lies to the nearest surrounding towns.

(Deuteronomy 21:3) 
And the elders of the city that is found to be the closest to the body must take a young heifer from the herd, one that has never been put under a yoke or used for any work.

(Deuteronomy 21:4) 
They shall bring the heifer to a rugged valley that has never been plowed or sown with seed, and there they shall break its neck.

(Deuteronomy 21:5) 
Then the priests of the Levitical lineage (for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to Him, and to bless in His name, and by their word every dispute and every matter of clean or unclean is to be judged) shall come forward.

(Deuteronomy 21:6) 
And the elders of that city which was found closest to the murdered man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.

(Deuteronomy 21:7) 
And they shall declare: "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes witness it.

(Deuteronomy 21:8) 
Be merciful, O Lord, to Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed; and do not allow innocent blood to remain among Your people Israel." And so the guilt of the blood shall be atoned for.

(Deuteronomy 21:9) 
Thus you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you have done what the Lord commands.

(Deuteronomy 21:10) 
If you go out to fight against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your power, and you take them as captives of war:

(Deuteronomy 21:11) 
And if you see a beautiful woman among the captives, and you desire her, and wish to take her as your wife:

(Deuteronomy 21:12) 
You must bring her into your house. She shall then shave all the hair from her head, and she must trim her nails (these actions are part of a purification ritual for a non-Israelite woman).

(Deuteronomy 21:13) 
And she shall remove the clothing in which she was captured. She must then sit in your house and mourn her father and mother for one full month. After this period, you may go in to her, and sleep with her; and you shall be her husband, and she shall be your wife.

(Deuteronomy 21:14) 
But if afterwards you no longer desire to have her as your wife, you must let her go free. You shall not sell her for money, nor shall you treat her as a slave, because you have humbled her (by taking her as a wife and then rejecting her).

(Deuteronomy 21:15) 
If a man has two wives, one dearly loved and the other hated, and both have borne him children, and the firstborn son happens to be the son of the hated wife:

(Deuteronomy 21:16) 
Then, when he divides his inheritance among his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved wife as the firstborn, preferring him over the son of the hated wife, who is indeed the true firstborn.

(Deuteronomy 21:17) 
Instead, he must acknowledge the son of the hated wife as the firstborn, and give him a double portion of all that he possesses. For that son is the first fruit of his strength, and the right of the firstborn belongs to him.

(Deuteronomy 21:18) 
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the words of his father or his mother, and though corrected, stubbornly refuses to obey:

(Deuteronomy 21:19) 
His father and mother shall both take hold of him and bring him before the elders of the city, at the city gate where judgments are made.

(Deuteronomy 21:20) 
And they shall say to the elders: "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he refuses to listen to our commands, and he is given over to gluttony and drunkenness."

(Deuteronomy 21:21) 
Then all the people of that city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die. You must remove this evil from among you, so that all of Israel may hear and be filled with fear (and learn from his example).

(Deuteronomy 21:22) 
When a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he has been put to death and then hung on a tree (as a public display):

(Deuteronomy 21:23) 
His corpse shall not remain on the tree overnight. You must bury him on the same day, because anyone hung on a tree is cursed by God. Do not defile the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 21:1) 
If a man is found slain in the land—the territory the Lord your God is giving you to possess—lying in a field, and it is not known who killed him,

(Deuteronomy 21:2) 
then your elders and your judges must go out and measure the distance from the place where the body lies to the nearest towns.

(Deuteronomy 21:3) 
Whichever town they determine is the closest, the elders of that town must take a heifer from the herd—one that has never been used for work, neither pulling a yoke nor an plow.

(Deuteronomy 21:4) 
They must lead the heifer to a rugged valley that has never been tilled or sown with seeds, and there, in the dry riverbed, they must break the heifer’s neck.

(Deuteronomy 21:5) 
Then the priests, who are from the tribe of Levi, must approach—because the Lord your God chose them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word, every matter, both clean and unclean, is to be judged.

(Deuteronomy 21:6) 
And all the elders of that town, which is nearest to the slain man, must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.

(Deuteronomy 21:7) 
Then they must declare: 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes witness this crime.'

(Deuteronomy 21:8) 
They must pray: 'Be merciful, O Lord, to Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed. Do not hold the guilt of this innocent blood against Your people Israel.' And the guilt of that blood will be forgiven them—it will be expiated for them.

(Deuteronomy 21:9) 
Thus, you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you do what the Lord has commanded.

(Deuteronomy 21:10) 
When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your hand, and you take captives—

(Deuteronomy 21:11) 
and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife—

(Deuteronomy 21:12) 
you must bring her into your house. She must shave her head and trim her nails.

(Deuteronomy 21:13) 
She must remove the clothes in which she was captured and remain in your house, mourning her father and mother for one full month. After that period, you may go in to her, lie with her, and she will be your wife, and you her husband.

(Deuteronomy 21:14) 
But if you no longer desire her, you must let her go free. You are not to sell her for money, nor oppress her by force, because you have humbled her—taken away her former dignity.

(Deuteronomy 21:15) 
If a man has two wives, one who is loved and another who is disliked, and both bear him sons, but the firstborn son is from the disliked wife, and the second son is from the loved wife—

(Deuteronomy 21:16) 
when he divides his inheritance among his sons, he cannot make the son of the loved wife the firstborn, preferring him over the son of the disliked wife, who is the true and legitimate firstborn.

(Deuteronomy 21:17) 
Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn son of the disliked wife by giving him a double portion of all he possesses. For that son is the first of his strength, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him.

(Deuteronomy 21:18) 
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the words of his father or his mother, and even when corrected, he scorns to obey—

(Deuteronomy 21:19) 
his father and mother must both take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his town, at the gate where judicial matters are heard.

(Deuteronomy 21:20) 
They must say to the elders: 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he refuses to listen to our warnings. He is given to gluttony, drunkenness, and wild feasts.'

(Deuteronomy 21:21) 
Then all the people of his town must stone him to death. You must remove this evil from among you, and all Israel, hearing of it, will be struck with fear.

(Deuteronomy 21:22) 
If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and is executed, and afterward his body is hanged on a tree—

(Deuteronomy 21:23) 
his corpse must not remain on the tree overnight. You must bury him the same day. For a hanged man is cursed by God, and you must not defile your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 22:1) 
If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep wandering astray, you must not ignore it or walk away as if it does not concern you. Instead, you must make sure to bring it back to him.

(Deuteronomy 22:2) 
Even if your fellow Israelite is not nearby, or you do not know him, you must bring the animal into your own house. It must stay with you until your fellow Israelite asks for it, and then you must return it to him.

(Deuteronomy 22:3) 
You must do the same for a donkey, a piece of clothing, and any lost thing belonging to your fellow Israelite that you find. You must not neglect any such thing.

(Deuteronomy 22:4) 
You must not see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox collapsed on the road and walk by as if it does not concern you. Instead, you must help the animal get back up.

(Deuteronomy 22:5) 
A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor may a man wear women’s clothing. Whoever does such things is an abomination to God.

(Deuteronomy 22:6) 
If, while walking along the road, you find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground with a mother bird sitting on her young or on her eggs, you must not take the mother along with the young.

(Deuteronomy 22:7) 
Instead, you must let the mother bird fly away, and then you may take the young for yourself. This command ensures your well-being and a long life.

(Deuteronomy 22:8) 
When you build a new house, you must build a parapet wall around the edge of the roof. This is to prevent anyone from falling off the roof, so that you do not incur the guilt of bloodshed in your home.

(Deuteronomy 22:9) 
You must not plant your vineyard with two different kinds of seeds. If you do, both the crop you sow and the produce from the vines will be declared holy and therefore forbidden to you.

(Deuteronomy 22:10) 
You must not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.

(Deuteronomy 22:11) 
You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.

(Deuteronomy 22:12) 
You must make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.

(Deuteronomy 22:13) 
If a man takes a wife, and after having relations with her, he comes to hate her,

(Deuteronomy 22:14) 
and he accuses her of a terrible crime and slanders her, saying, 'I took this woman as my wife, and when I had relations with her, I found no evidence that she was a virgin!'

(Deuteronomy 22:15) 
then the girl’s parents and her witnesses must gather the evidence of her virginity and bring it to the elders of the city, who are seated at the city gate.

(Deuteronomy 22:16) 
And they must say to the elders, 'We gave our daughter to this man as his wife. Now he hates her,

(Deuteronomy 22:17) 
and has accused her of a terrible crime, saying, 'I found your daughter was not a virgin.' But here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!—and they must spread the garment before the elders of the city.

(Deuteronomy 22:18) 
Therefore, the elders of that city must take the man and publicly beat him. They must also fine him one hundred silver shekels, which they must give to the girl’s father,

(Deuteronomy 22:19) 
because he slandered an Israelite virgin. He will not be permitted to divorce her for the rest of his life.

(Deuteronomy 22:20) 
However, if the accusation he made is true, and no evidence of virginity is found in the girl,

(Deuteronomy 22:21) 
then they must bring her out to the entrance of her father’s house, and the men of her city must stone her to death. She has committed an outrage in Israel by defiling herself through fornication while still in her father’s house. You must remove this evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 22:22) 
If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both of them—the adulterer and the adulteress—must be put to death. You must remove this evil from Israel.

(Deuteronomy 22:23) 
If a man finds a virgin girl who is betrothed to another man within a city, and he lies with her,

(Deuteronomy 22:24) 
you must bring both of them to the city gate and stone them to death. The girl must die because she did not cry out for help, even though she was in the city. The man must die because he violated his neighbor’s betrothed wife. You must remove this evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 22:25) 
But if a man finds a betrothed girl in the open country and seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her must be put to death.

(Deuteronomy 22:26) 
The girl is innocent and deserves no punishment of death, because this crime is like a man ambushing and murdering another man. That is how the girl suffered.

(Deuteronomy 22:27) 
She was alone in the open country, she cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.

(Deuteronomy 22:28) 
If a man finds a virgin girl who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,

(Deuteronomy 22:29) 
the man who lay with her must pay the girl’s father fifty silver shekels. He must also take the girl as his wife, because he violated her, and he will not be permitted to divorce her for the rest of his life.

(Deuteronomy 22:30) 
A man must not marry his father’s wife, nor may he have sexual relations with her.

(Deuteronomy 22:1) 
You must not see your kinsman's ox or sheep wandering away and ignore it as if it isn't your concern. Instead, you must bring it back to your kinsman.

(Deuteronomy 22:2) 
But if your kinsman isn't nearby, or if you don't know who the owner is, then you must bring the animal to your own house. Keep it with you there until your kinsman comes looking for it, and then you must return it to him.

(Deuteronomy 22:3) 
You must do the same for your kinsman's donkey, or his garment, or any other lost property of your kinsman. If you find something, you must not neglect it or pretend you didn't see it.

(Deuteronomy 22:4) 
You must not see your kinsman's donkey or ox collapsed on the road and just walk by as if it's none of your business. Instead, you must help him lift it up.

(Deuteronomy 22:5) 
A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor must a man wear women's clothing. For all who do these things are utterly detestable in the sight of God.

(Deuteronomy 22:6) 
If you find a bird's nest on the road, or in a tree, or on the ground, with the mother bird sitting on chicks or eggs, you must not take the mother with her young.

(Deuteronomy 22:7) 
But you must allow the mother to fly away, and then you may take the young for yourself, so that it may go well with you and you may live a long time.

(Deuteronomy 22:8) 
When you build a new house, you must build a parapet or railing around your roof. This is to ensure that if someone falls from it, the guilt of bloodshed will not rest upon your house.

(Deuteronomy 22:9) 
You must not sow your vineyard with two different kinds of seed. If you do, the entire harvest—both the crop you planted and the fruit of the vineyard—will become consecrated for God, meaning it will be forfeited.

(Deuteronomy 22:10) 
You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.

(Deuteronomy 22:11) 
You must not wear clothing woven from wool and linen together.

(Deuteronomy 22:12) 
You must make cords or tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.

(Deuteronomy 22:13) 
If a man takes a wife, and after having relations with her, he comes to hate her,

(Deuteronomy 22:14) 
and then he invents disgraceful accusations against her, saying: "I took this woman as my wife, and when I went in to her, I did not find in her the signs of her virginity—meaning, proof that she was a virgin before our marriage."

(Deuteronomy 22:15) 
Then the father and mother of the young woman must take the proof of her virginity and bring it with them to the elders of the city, who sit in the gate for judgment.

(Deuteronomy 22:16) 
And the father will say: "I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, but now he hates her,"

(Deuteronomy 22:17) 
and he has falsely accused her, saying: "I did not find your daughter to be a virgin." But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity." And they will spread the garment before the elders of the city.

(Deuteronomy 22:18) 
Then the elders of that city must take that man and punish him with lashes.

(Deuteronomy 22:19) 
Moreover, they must fine him one hundred pieces of gold, which he must give to the young woman's father. This is because he defamed a virgin of Israel with a wicked accusation. He must also continue to have her as his wife and will not be permitted to divorce her for all the days of his life.

(Deuteronomy 22:20) 
But if the accusation is true, and the proofs of virginity were not found in the young woman:

(Deuteronomy 22:21) 
Then they must bring her out to the entrance of her father's house, and the men of her city must stone her to death. This is because she committed an outrageous act in Israel by committing fornication while in her father's house. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from among you.

(Deuteronomy 22:22) 
If a man is caught sleeping with another man's wife, both of them must die—that is, both the adulterer and the adulteress. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from Israel.

(Deuteronomy 22:23) 
If a young woman, a virgin, is engaged to a man, and someone finds her in the city and has relations with her:

(Deuteronomy 22:24) 
Both of them must be brought to the gate of that city, and they must be stoned to death. The young woman must die because she did not cry out for help, even though she was in the city. The man must die because he violated his kinsman's betrothed wife. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from among you.

(Deuteronomy 22:25) 
However, if a man finds an engaged young woman in the open country and seizes her and has relations with her, then only the man must die.

(Deuteronomy 22:26) 
The young woman will suffer no punishment and is not guilty of death. This is because she is like a man who is ambushed by a robber and violently attacked—just so, the young woman suffered this violence.

(Deuteronomy 22:27) 
She cried out for help, but there was no one to rescue her.

(Deuteronomy 22:28) 
If a man finds a young virgin woman who is not engaged, and he seizes her and has relations with her, and he is caught in the act:

(Deuteronomy 22:29) 
Then the man who had relations with her must give the young woman's father fifty pieces of silver. He must also take her as his wife, because he violated her, and he will not be permitted to divorce her for all the days of his life.

(Deuteronomy 22:30) 
A man must not take his father's wife as his own, nor uncover her father's nakedness. This means he must not have sexual relations with her.

(Deuteronomy 23:1) 
A man who has had his testicles crushed or cut off, or his penis cut off, shall not enter the assembly of the Lord’s people.

(Deuteronomy 23:2) 
A mamzer—that is, a child born from an unchaste woman or an illicit union—shall not enter the assembly of the Lord, not even to the tenth generation.

(Deuteronomy 23:3) 
The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not enter the assembly of the Lord, not even to the tenth generation, and even beyond that, forever.

(Deuteronomy 23:4) 
This is because they did not come out to meet you with bread and water on the road when you were coming out of Egypt. And also because they hired Balaam, the son of Beor, from Mesopotamia of Syria, to curse you.

(Deuteronomy 23:5) 
However, the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam, and He turned Balaam’s curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord loved you.

(Deuteronomy 23:6) 
You shall never make peace with them, nor any alliance, forever.

(Deuteronomy 23:7) 
You shall not detest an Edomite, because he is your brother. Nor shall you detest an Egyptian, because you were once an immigrant in his land.

(Deuteronomy 23:8) 
The children who are born to them in the third generation may enter the assembly of the Lord.

(Deuteronomy 23:9) 
When you go out to battle against your enemies, you shall guard yourself from every wicked thing.

(Deuteronomy 23:10) 
If there is any man among you who has become unclean from a nocturnal emission—a wet dream—he shall go outside the camp and shall not return until he has washed himself with water.

(Deuteronomy 23:11) 
And after sunset, having washed away all impurity, he may re-enter the camp.

(Deuteronomy 23:12) 
You shall have a designated place outside the camp for the necessities of nature, a place suitable for cleanliness.

(Deuteronomy 23:13) 
You shall also have a digging tool among your provisions, and when you sit outside the camp for defecation, you shall dig in the ground and cover whatever you have expelled.

(Deuteronomy 23:14) 
For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you. Therefore, your camp must be holy, and nothing indecent or impure shall appear in it, lest God abandon you.

(Deuteronomy 23:15) 
If a servant who has fled his master seeks refuge with you, you shall not hand him over to his master.

(Deuteronomy 23:16) 
Instead, he shall remain with you in the place that pleases him and in one of your cities, wherever he desires. You shall not oppress him.

(Deuteronomy 23:17) 
There shall be no harlot among the daughters of Israel, nor any male prostitute among the sons of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 23:18) 
You shall not bring the wages of a prostitute, nor the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord your God, no matter what you have vowed. For both of these are detestable to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 23:19) 
You shall not lend money to your brother at interest, nor grain, nor any other thing.

(Deuteronomy 23:20) 
But you may lend to a foreigner. To your brother, however, you shall lend without charging interest, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your work in the land which you are entering to possess.

(Deuteronomy 23:21) 
When you make a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay fulfilling it. For the Lord your God will surely require it of you, and if you delay, it will be counted as a sin for you.

(Deuteronomy 23:22) 
If you choose not to make a promise by vowing, you will be without sin.

(Deuteronomy 23:23) 
Whatever has come out of your lips, you shall keep and perform, just as you promised to the Lord your God, for you spoke it of your own free will and with your own mouth.

(Deuteronomy 23:24) 
When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat grapes as much as you like to satisfy yourself, but you shall not carry any away from the vineyard.

(Deuteronomy 23:25) 
If you enter your friend’s standing grain field, you may pluck heads of grain and rub them in your hand, but you shall not use a sickle to harvest his grain.

(Deuteronomy 24:1) 
If a man takes a wife and marries her, but she does not find favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her—a shameful act that makes her displeasing to him—then he must write a certificate of divorce for her, put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

(Deuteronomy 24:2) 
And when she has left him and gone from him, and taken another husband,

(Deuteronomy 24:3) 
and if that second husband also dislikes her and gives her a certificate of divorce, sending her out of his house—or if this second husband dies,

(Deuteronomy 24:4) 
then her first husband cannot take her back as his wife, because she has been defiled and has become abominable before the Lord. You must not allow such a sin to pollute your land, which the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 24:5) 
When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out to war, nor shall any public duty be imposed upon him. He must be free from any obligation at home for one year, and he shall make his wife whom he has taken happy.

(Deuteronomy 24:6) 
You shall not take the lower and upper millstones as a pledge—the grinding equipment necessary for daily bread—nor a fulling mill; for that would be taking a man's very livelihood as a pledge, which is like taking his soul.

(Deuteronomy 24:7) 
If a man is found kidnapping one of his brothers from the children of Israel, and selling him, or if he is found exploiting him for profit, that kidnapper must die. You are to remove this evil from among you.

(Deuteronomy 24:8) 
Be very careful to observe the laws concerning leprosy. Do everything the Levitical priests instruct you, just as I commanded them, and fulfill their instructions fully.

(Deuteronomy 24:9) 
Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam—Moses' sister—on the way when you came out of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 24:10) 
When you lend money to your neighbor, you shall not enter his house to take a pledge from him.

(Deuteronomy 24:11) 
Instead, you must stand outside, and he himself shall bring you what he has as a pledge.

(Deuteronomy 24:12) 
If, however, the borrower is a poor man, his pledge shall not remain with you overnight.

(Deuteronomy 24:13) 
You must return it to him at sunset, so that he may sleep in his garment and bless you. This act of justice will be counted to you before the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 24:14) 
You shall not deny payment to a poor and needy hired servant, whether he is one of your own brothers or an alien residing with you in your land.

(Deuteronomy 24:15) 
But on the very same day, you must pay him his wages before the sun sets, for he is poor and depends on that money for his very life. If you do not pay him, he may cry out to the Lord against you, and it will be counted as a sin to you.

(Deuteronomy 24:16) 
Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers. Each person shall die for his own sin.

(Deuteronomy 24:17) 
You shall not pervert the justice due to an alien or an orphan, nor shall you take a widow's garment as a pledge.

(Deuteronomy 24:18) 
But remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God delivered you from there. Therefore, I command you to do this thing—to show justice and mercy to the vulnerable.

(Deuteronomy 24:19) 
When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf of grain there, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the orphan, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

(Deuteronomy 24:20) 
When you beat your olive trees to gather their fruit, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave whatever remains on the trees for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.

(Deuteronomy 24:21) 
When you gather the grapes from your vineyard, do not collect the remaining clusters. You must allow them to go to the alien, the orphan, and the widow.

(Deuteronomy 24:22) 
Remember that you also were slaves in Egypt, and for that reason, I command you to do this thing—to care for the needy as you were once cared for.

(Deuteronomy 24:1) 
If a man takes a woman as his wife and marries her,
and she does not find favor in his eyes because of some indecency or moral defect discovered in her,
then he is to write a bill of divorce.
He must give this document into her hand,
and then he is to send her out of his house.

(Deuteronomy 24:2) 
And when she has gone out from him and departed,
and then has joined herself in marriage to another man,

(Deuteronomy 24:3) 
and that man also comes to detest her,
and has written her a bill of divorce, and given it into her hand, and sent her out of his house—
or if that man has died certainly,

(Deuteronomy 24:4) 
then the former husband will not be able to take her back as his wife,
because she is now defiled, and has become an abomination before the Lord.
You must not bring such a sin upon the land
which the Lord your God is giving you to possess.

(Deuteronomy 24:5) 
If a man has recently married a wife,
he shall not go out to war, nor shall any compulsory service be imposed upon him.
Instead, he shall be free from all obligations at his home for one year,
so that he may bring joy to the wife whom he has taken.

(Deuteronomy 24:6) 
You shall not take as security the lower or upper millstone,
nor the implements of a fuller (which are essential for his work),
because by doing so, one pledges a person's very means of life itself.

(Deuteronomy 24:7) 
If a man is caught kidnapping one of his brothers from among the children of Israel,
and then sells him for a price, having received money for him,
that man shall be taken away and put to death.
Thus, you shall remove this evil from your midst.

(Deuteronomy 24:8) 
Take careful heed that you do not contract the plague of leprosy.
You must do everything that the priests of the Levitical lineage have taught you.
You shall diligently fulfill and carry out everything according to what I have commanded them.

(Deuteronomy 24:9) 
Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam (the sister of Moses) on the journey,
when you were coming out of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 24:10) 
When you lend money to your neighbor,
you shall not enter his house to take a pledge (or collateral).

(Deuteronomy 24:11) 
Instead, you shall stand outside,
and he himself shall bring out to you whatever he has for a pledge.

(Deuteronomy 24:12) 
If he is a poor man,
the pledge (such as a garment needed for warmth) shall not remain with you overnight.

(Deuteronomy 24:13) 
But you shall immediately return it to him in the evening,
so that when he sleeps in his own garment, he may bless you.
This act of mercy will be counted as righteousness for you before the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 24:14) 
You shall not oppress a poor and needy hired servant,
whether he is one of your own people,
or a foreigner who dwells with you in your land.

(Deuteronomy 24:15) 
But on the very same day, you shall pay him his wages before the sun sets,
because he is poor and depends on it to sustain his very life.
Otherwise, he might cry out against you to the Lord,
and it will be counted as a sin for you.

(Deuteronomy 24:16) 
A father shall not be put to death for the sin of his son,
nor shall a son be put to death for the sin of his father.
Each person shall die for his own sin.

(Deuteronomy 24:17) 
You shall not pervert the justice due to a foreigner or an orphan,
nor shall you take a widow's garment as a pledge (for it is her only covering).

(Deuteronomy 24:18) 
Remember that you yourselves were slaves in Egypt,
and the Lord your God delivered you from there (from your slavery).
Therefore, I command you to do this thing (to care for the vulnerable).

(Deuteronomy 24:19) 
When you reap your harvest in your field,
and have forgotten a sheaf of grain and left it behind,
you shall not return again to take it.
Instead, you shall leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow to gather,
so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

(Deuteronomy 24:20) 
When you beat down the fruit from your olive trees,
you shall not go back again to gather what remains on the branches.
Instead, you shall leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.

(Deuteronomy 24:21) 
When you gather the grapes from your vineyard,
you shall not collect the remaining clusters of grapes.
Instead, you shall leave them for the resident foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.

(Deuteronomy 24:22) 
Remember that you yourselves were also slaves in Egypt,
and therefore I command you to do this thing (to care for the needy).

(Deuteronomy 25:1) 
If a legal dispute arises between men, and a judgment is needed to resolve it, and the judges render a just verdict, declaring the guilty party condemned and the innocent party absolved:

(Deuteronomy 25:2) 
If the guilty party is deserving of physical punishment, the judge must have him laid down and beaten with rods in his presence, according to the severity of his sin and the manner of the beating.

(Deuteronomy 25:3) 
The punishment must not exceed forty blows, so that your brother, the one receiving the punishment, is not too severely disgraced and disfigured beyond what is humanely bearable.

(Deuteronomy 25:4) 
You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing your grain in the threshing floor, for it deserves to eat from the fruits of its labor.

(Deuteronomy 25:5) 
When brothers live together and one of them dies without having children, his widow must not marry an outsider. Instead, her late husband’s brother must marry her to raise up an heir for his deceased brother's lineage, and the firstborn son they have together will be named after the deceased brother.

(Deuteronomy 25:6) 
If the brother refuses to marry his deceased brother’s wife, as he is legally bound to do, the woman must go to the city gate and appeal to the elders, declaring: 'My husband’s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel, and he will not take me as his wife.'

(Deuteronomy 25:7) 
The elders will immediately summon him and question him. If he replies: 'I do not wish to marry her as my wife:'

(Deuteronomy 25:8) 
Then the woman must approach him in the presence of the elders, and she will remove his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face, saying: 'This is what happens to the man who refuses to build up his brother’s household and continue his legacy.'

(Deuteronomy 25:9) 
And in Israel, his family name will forever be known as 'the house of the one who lost his sandal,' marking his failure to fulfill his duty.

(Deuteronomy 25:10) 
If two men are fighting, and the wife of one of them tries to rescue her husband from the stronger man by reaching out her hand and grabbing his private parts:

(Deuteronomy 25:11) 
You must cut off her hand, showing her no pity for such an indecent and aggressive act.

(Deuteronomy 25:12) 
You must not keep two different kinds of weights in your bag, a heavier one for buying and a lighter one for selling, for such dishonesty is an abomination.

(Deuteronomy 25:13) 
And you must not have two different kinds of measures in your house, a larger one for buying and a smaller one for selling.

(Deuteronomy 25:14) 
You must always have honest and accurate weights and measures. This practice will ensure you live a long time in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

(Deuteronomy 25:15) 
For the Lord your God detests anyone who commits such injustices, for He is fundamentally opposed to all wickedness and dishonesty.

(Deuteronomy 25:16) 
You must not keep two different kinds of weights in your bag, a heavier one for buying and a lighter one for selling, for such dishonesty is an abomination.

(Deuteronomy 25:17) 
Remember what the Amalekites did to you on your journey when you were coming out of Egypt.

(Deuteronomy 25:18) 
Remember how they attacked you along the way, striking down all the stragglers at the very rear of your column who were exhausted and faltering, while you were hungry and thirsty, and they did this without any fear of God.

(Deuteronomy 25:19) 
Therefore, when the Lord your God grants you rest from all your enemies surrounding you in the land He is giving you as an inheritance, you must completely wipe out the memory of the Amalekites from under the sky. Make sure you never forget this command.

(Deuteronomy 26:1) 
When you finally enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, and you have taken it over and settled down there to live in it:

(Deuteronomy 26:2) 
you are to take some of the first fruits of all the produce of your land that you harvest from the land the Lord your God has given you. Put them in a basket, and go to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His Name to be praised and invoked there.

(Deuteronomy 26:3) 
And you shall go to the priest who is ministering in those days, and you shall say to him: "I declare today before the Lord your God that I have come into the land for which the Lord swore to our fathers that He would give it to us."

(Deuteronomy 26:4) 
And the priest will take the basket from your hand and place it before the altar of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 26:5) 
And you shall speak and say in the presence of the Lord your God: "A wandering Aramean was my father Jacob, who went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien with a very small number of people. He grew there into a great nation, powerful and of immense multitude."

(Deuteronomy 26:6) 
"And the Egyptians afflicted us and persecuted us, imposing heavy burdens upon us."

(Deuteronomy 26:7) 
"And we cried out to the Lord God of our fathers, and He heard us. He looked upon our affliction, our toil, and our distress."

(Deuteronomy 26:8) 
"And He led us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with signs, and with wonders, and with great terror."

(Deuteronomy 26:9) 
"And He brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey."

(Deuteronomy 26:10) 
"And therefore, now I offer the first fruits of the produce of the land which the Lord has given me." And you shall place them down in the presence of the Lord your God, and you shall adore the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 26:11) 
And you shall rejoice in all the good things that the Lord your God has given to you and to your household—you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who lives among you.

(Deuteronomy 26:12) 
When you have finished setting aside the tenth part of all your produce, during the third year, which is the year for tithing, you shall give it to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, so that they may eat within your towns and be fully satisfied.

(Deuteronomy 26:13) 
And you shall speak in the presence of the Lord your God: "I have taken the holy portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, just as You commanded me, neither going beyond Your commands nor forgetting them."

(Deuteronomy 26:14) 
"I have not eaten any of it while in mourning, nor have I set aside any of it for any unclean purpose, nor have I given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God, and I have done everything just as You commanded me."

(Deuteronomy 26:15) 
"Look down from Your holy sanctuary, from Your exalted dwelling place in the heavens (the spiritual realm), and bless Your people Israel, and the land You have given us, just as You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."

(Deuteronomy 26:16) 
Today the Lord your God has commanded you to perform these statutes and judgments. Therefore, you must carefully keep and fulfill them with all your heart and with all your soul.

(Deuteronomy 26:17) 
You have chosen the Lord today to be your God, and to walk in His ways, and to keep His ceremonies, and His commands, and His judgments, and to obey His voice.

(Deuteronomy 26:18) 
And the Lord has chosen you today to be His own special people, just as He promised you, and to carefully keep all His commands.

(Deuteronomy 26:19) 
And He will make you higher than all the nations He has created, in praise, and in name, and in His glory, so that you may be a holy people to the Lord your God, just as He has promised.

(Deuteronomy 26:1) 
When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you have taken hold of it and settled there,

(Deuteronomy 26:2) 
you shall take some of the first of all the produce of your land that you harvest from your soil, and put it in a basket, and you shall go to the special place where the Lord your God has chosen for His Name to be invoked and worshiped.

(Deuteronomy 26:3) 
and present yourself to the priest who is serving during that time, and declare to him: 'Today I openly declare before the Lord your God that I have entered the land concerning which the Lord swore an oath to our fathers that He would give it to us.'

(Deuteronomy 26:4) 
The priest shall then take the basket from your hand, and place it before the altar of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 26:5) 
Then you shall speak and say in the presence of the Lord your God: 'An Aramean (Laban) once afflicted my ancestor, Jacob, who was a wanderer about to perish. He went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien with only a small group. But there he grew into a great, strong, and countless nation.

(Deuteronomy 26:6) 
Then the Egyptians afflicted us and persecuted us by imposing heavy burdens upon us.

(Deuteronomy 26:7) 
So we cried out to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and He heard us and saw our humility, our suffering, and our oppression.

(Deuteronomy 26:8) 
and He brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, amidst terrifying acts, and great signs and wonders.

(Deuteronomy 26:9) 
He led us to this very place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey—a land of abundant blessings.

(Deuteronomy 26:10) 
Therefore, I now bring the firstfruits of the land that You, O Lord, have given me.' You shall then place them before the Lord your God, and you shall worship the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 26:11) 
And you shall rejoice in all the good things that the Lord your God has given to you and your household, together with the Levite and the foreign visitor who lives among you.

(Deuteronomy 26:12) 
When you have finished setting aside the tithe of all your produce in the third year, the year of tithing, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreign visitor, the orphan, and the widow, so that they may eat within your towns and be satisfied.

(Deuteronomy 26:13) 
Then you shall say in the presence of the Lord your God: 'I have removed the sacred portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, the foreign visitor, the orphan, and the widow, just as You commanded me. I have not violated Your commandments, nor have I forgotten Your precepts.'

(Deuteronomy 26:14) 
I have not eaten any of it while I was in mourning, nor set aside any of it for an unclean purpose, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God and have done everything as You commanded me.

(Deuteronomy 26:15) 
Look down from Your holy dwelling, from the exalted heavens—Your dwelling place—and bless Your people Israel, and the land You have given us, as You swore to our fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey.

(Deuteronomy 26:16) 
Today, the Lord your God commands you to observe these statutes and ordinances. You are to keep and fulfill them with all your heart and with all your soul.

(Deuteronomy 26:17) 
Today you have declared the Lord to be your God, that you may walk in His ways, keep His rituals, and observe His statutes and ordinances, and obey His voice.

(Deuteronomy 26:18) 
And the Lord has declared you today to be His own treasured people, just as He promised you, so that you may keep all His commandments.

(Deuteronomy 26:19) 
and that He may set you high above all the nations He has made, for His own praise, name, and glory, and that you may be a holy people to the Lord your God, just as He has declared.

(Deuteronomy 27:1) 
Moses and the elders of Israel gave this commandment to the people, saying, "Obey every command that I am giving to you today."

(Deuteronomy 27:2) 
When you cross the Jordan River to enter the land that the Lord your God is giving to you, you are to set up large stones for yourselves, and you are to coat them with plaster.

(Deuteronomy 27:3) 
And upon these stones, you are to write down all the words of this law. Do this after you have entered the land that the Lord your God is giving to you—a land flowing with milk and honey, just as He swore to our ancestors.

(Deuteronomy 27:4) 
Therefore, when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones—which I am commanding you today—on Mount Ebal, and you are to coat them with plaster.

(Deuteronomy 27:5) 
And there, on Mount Ebal, you are to build an altar to the Lord your God from stones that have not been cut by any iron tool.

(Deuteronomy 27:6) 
Use stones that are naturally rough and whole. And on this altar, you are to offer burnt offerings to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 27:7) 
You are also to sacrifice peace offerings, and you will eat them there, celebrating in the presence of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 27:8) 
And you are to write clearly and legibly upon these stones all the words of this law.

(Deuteronomy 27:9) 
Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all of Israel, saying, "Listen closely and pay attention, O Israel. Today, you have become the people of the Lord your God."

(Deuteronomy 27:10) 
Therefore, you must keep His commandments and His sacred rituals, which I am giving to you today.

(Deuteronomy 27:11) 
Moses also commanded the people on that very day, saying:

(Deuteronomy 27:12) 
These tribes are to stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people once you have crossed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.

(Deuteronomy 27:13) 
And these tribes, by contrast, are to stand on Mount Ebal to declare curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

(Deuteronomy 27:14) 
Then the Levites are to declare this and say in a loud voice to every man of Israel:

(Deuteronomy 27:15) 
Cursed is the man who makes an idol, whether carved or cast, an abomination to the Lord—something made by the hands of craftsmen—and then sets it up in a hidden place. And all the people are to answer and say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:16) 
Cursed is the one who dishonors his father or his mother. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:17) 
Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor's boundary marker. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:18) 
Cursed is the one who misleads a blind person who is lost on the road. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:19) 
Cursed is the one who perverts justice for a foreigner, an orphan, or a widow. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:20) 
Cursed is the one who sleeps with his father's wife, thereby uncovering his father's nakedness. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:21) 
Cursed is the one who sleeps with any animal. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:22) 
Cursed is the one who sleeps with his sister, whether she is his father's daughter or his mother's daughter. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:23) 
Cursed is the one who sleeps with his mother-in-law. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:24) 
Cursed is the one who secretly strikes down his neighbor. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:25) 
Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:26) 
Cursed is the one who does not uphold the words of this law, nor fully carry them out through his actions. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'

(Deuteronomy 27:1) 
Moses and the elders of Israel then gave instructions to the people, saying, 'Keep every command that I am giving to all of you today.'

(Deuteronomy 27:2) 
When you cross the Jordan River to enter the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, you must set up large stones for yourselves and cover them with a smooth coating of lime,

(Deuteronomy 27:3) 
and on these stones, you are to write all the words of this law once you have crossed over, so that you may truly enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you—a land of abundance, flowing with milk and honey—just as the Lord swore to your ancestors.

(Deuteronomy 27:4) 
Therefore, as soon as you have crossed the Jordan, you must set up these stones, which I command you today, on Mount Ebal. You shall also prepare them by covering them with lime,

(Deuteronomy 27:5) 
and there, on Mount Ebal, you are to build an altar to the Lord your God using stones that have not been touched by any iron tool or cut into shape.

(Deuteronomy 27:6) 
You shall build the altar of the Lord your God from these unworked, natural stones, and upon it, you will offer burnt sacrifices to the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 27:7) 
You will also offer peace offerings, which you will eat there, and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 27:8) 
And on these stones, you shall write all the words of this law clearly and distinctly, so that everyone can read them.

(Deuteronomy 27:9) 
Then Moses, along with the priests from the tribe of Levi, spoke to all of Israel, saying: 'Listen closely and pay attention, O Israel! For today, you have officially become the people of the Lord your God.'

(Deuteronomy 27:10) 
Therefore, you are to keep His commandments and His ceremonies, which I am giving to you today.

(Deuteronomy 27:11) 
Moses also commanded the people on that same day, saying:

(Deuteronomy 27:12) 
When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.

(Deuteronomy 27:13) 
And in contrast, these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to declare curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

(Deuteronomy 27:14) 
Then the Levites shall proclaim and declare in a loud voice to every man of Israel:

(Deuteronomy 27:15) 
'Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image—an abomination to the Lord, the work of artisans' hands—and sets it up in secret.' And all the people shall respond and say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:16) 
'Cursed be he who treats his father or mother with contempt.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:17) 
'Cursed be he who moves his neighbor’s landmark or property boundary.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:18) 
'Cursed be he who misleads a blind person on their journey.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:19) 
'Cursed be he who perverts justice for the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:20) 
'Cursed be he who sleeps with his father’s wife, uncovering his father’s nakedness.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:21) 
'Cursed be he who has sexual relations with any animal.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:22) 
'Cursed be he who sleeps with his sister, whether his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:23) 
'Cursed be he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:24) 
'Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret, intending harm.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:25) 
'Cursed be he who accepts a bribe to shed innocent blood.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 27:26) 
'Cursed be he who does not uphold the words of this law and fails to perform them completely.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'

(Deuteronomy 28:1) 
If you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God, so that you keep and obey all of His commandments which I am giving to you today, then the Lord your God will raise you higher than all the nations that are on the earth.

(Deuteronomy 28:2) 
And all these blessings will come upon you and they will overtake you, if you actually listen to His commandments.

(Deuteronomy 28:3) 
You will be blessed in the city, and blessed in the field.

(Deuteronomy 28:4) 
Blessed will be the children born to you, and the produce of your land, and the offspring of your livestock: the flocks of your sheep and the herds of your cattle.

(Deuteronomy 28:5) 
Blessed will be your storehouse and your provisions.

(Deuteronomy 28:6) 
You will be blessed when you come in and when you go out.

(Deuteronomy 28:7) 
The Lord will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be utterly defeated before your eyes. They will come against you on one path, but they will flee from you on seven paths, unable to stand against you.

(Deuteronomy 28:8) 
The Lord will send His blessing upon your storehouses and upon all the work of your hands. And He will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving to you.

(Deuteronomy 28:9) 
The Lord will establish you for Himself as a holy people, just as He swore to you, if you truly keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in His ways.

(Deuteronomy 28:10) 
And all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name of the Lord is invoked over you—meaning you belong to Him and are under His divine protection—and they will fear you.

(Deuteronomy 28:11) 
The Lord will cause you to abound with every good thing: with children born to you, and with the offspring of your livestock, and with the produce of your land, which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to you.

(Deuteronomy 28:12) 
The Lord will open His good treasure house, the sky, to give rain to your land in its proper season. And He will bless all the work of your hands, and you will lend to many nations, and you yourself will not need to borrow from anyone.

(Deuteronomy 28:13) 
The Lord will make you the head and not the tail; and you will always be above, and never below, if you actually listen to the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding you today, and if you keep and obey them.

(Deuteronomy 28:14) 
And you must not turn away from the words that I am commanding you today, either to the right or to the left, so that you do not follow other gods or worship them.

(Deuteronomy 28:15) 
But if you refuse to listen to the voice of the Lord your God, so that you keep and obey all His commandments and statutes, which I am commanding you today, then all these curses will come upon you and they will overtake you.

(Deuteronomy 28:16) 
You will be cursed in the city, and cursed in the field.

(Deuteronomy 28:17) 
Cursed will be your storehouse and your provisions.

(Deuteronomy 28:18) 
Cursed will be the children born to you, and the produce of your land, the flocks of your sheep and the herds of your cattle.

(Deuteronomy 28:19) 
You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.

(Deuteronomy 28:20) 
The Lord will send upon you famine and thirst, and frustration and defeat in all the work you undertake, until He crushes you and quickly destroys you because of the wickedness of your ways, by which you have abandoned Me.

(Deuteronomy 28:21) 
The Lord will afflict you with a persistent plague until He consumes you from the land into which you are going to possess it.

(Deuteronomy 28:22) 
The Lord will strike you with a wasting disease, with fever and chills, with burning fever and scorching heat, and with blight and mildew that destroy your crops; and these will pursue you until you perish.

(Deuteronomy 28:23) 
And the sky above you will be like bronze, meaning it will give no rain, and the earth that you walk on will be like iron, meaning it will be hard and barren.

(Deuteronomy 28:24) 
The Lord will give as rain for your land from the sky, dust and ashes; from the sky these will descend upon you until you are destroyed.

(Deuteronomy 28:25) 
The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will go out against them on one path, but flee on seven paths, and you will be scattered among all the kingdoms of the earth.

(Deuteronomy 28:26) 
And your dead body will be food for all the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to bury you.

(Deuteronomy 28:27) 
The Lord will strike you with the boils of Egypt, and with festering sores, and with scabies and persistent itching, so that you cannot be cured.

(Deuteronomy 28:28) 
The Lord will strike you with madness, and with blindness, and with confusion of mind.

(Deuteronomy 28:29) 
And you will grope around at noon, just as a blind person gropes in darkness, and you will not find your way. At all times you will suffer injustice and be oppressed by violence, and there will be no one to rescue you.

(Deuteronomy 28:30) 
You will take a wife, but another man will lie with her. You will build a house, but not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but not gather its grapes.

(Deuteronomy 28:31) 
Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, and you will not eat its meat. Your donkey will be stolen right before your eyes and not be returned to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and there will be no one to help you.

(Deuteronomy 28:32) 
Your sons and your daughters will be given over to another people while your eyes see it happen, and your eyes will waste away longing for them with no hope, and there will be no strength in your hand to prevent it.

(Deuteronomy 28:33) 
The produce of your land and all your hard work, a people whom you do not know will eat. And you will always suffer injustice and be oppressed all your days.

(Deuteronomy 28:34) 
Your eyes will grow dim from longing for what you expect to see but never will, and you will be filled with horror at everything you witness.

(Deuteronomy 28:35) 
The Lord will strike you with terrible boils on your knees and on your thighs, and you will not be able to be cured, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.

(Deuteronomy 28:36) 
The Lord will lead you and your king, whom you set over yourselves, to a nation that neither you nor your fathers have known. And there you will serve other gods, made of wood and stone.

(Deuteronomy 28:37) 
And you will become an object of astonishment, and a proverb, and a derisive tale among all the peoples to whom the Lord has brought you.

(Deuteronomy 28:38) 
You will sow much seed in the ground, but gather little, because locusts will devour everything.

(Deuteronomy 28:39) 
You will plant vineyards and cultivate them, but you will not drink their wine, nor will you gather anything from them, because they will be devoured by pests.

(Deuteronomy 28:40) 
You will have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you will not anoint yourselves with their oil, because their olives will fall off and perish before they can be harvested.

(Deuteronomy 28:1) 
If you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God and carefully keep all His commandments, which I am giving you today, the Lord your God will raise you up above all the other nations on the earth.

(Deuteronomy 28:2) 
And all these blessings will come upon you and find you, if you genuinely listen to the commandments of the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 28:3) 
You will be blessed in the city, and you will be blessed in the countryside.

(Deuteronomy 28:4) 
Blessed will be the children born to you, the produce from your land, and the offspring of your livestock—your flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.

(Deuteronomy 28:5) 
Blessed will be your baskets and your storage bins.

(Deuteronomy 28:6) 
You will be blessed when you come in, and blessed when you go out.

(Deuteronomy 28:7) 
The Lord will hand over your enemies, those who rise against you; they will be defeated right before your eyes. They will come against you by one road, but they will flee from you in seven different directions.

(Deuteronomy 28:8) 
The Lord will command blessings upon you in your storage bins and in everything you do with your hands. He will bless you in the land that the Lord gives to you.

(Deuteronomy 28:9) 
The Lord will establish you as His holy people, just as He swore to you He would. This will happen if you keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in His ways.

(Deuteronomy 28:10) 
All the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord, and they will be in awe of you.

(Deuteronomy 28:11) 
The Lord will grant you abundant prosperity in children, in the offspring of your livestock, and in the produce of your land, in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers He would give you.

(Deuteronomy 28:12) 
The Lord will open His rich storehouse, the sky, to send rain on your land in its proper season. He will bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations, but you will not need to borrow from any.

(Deuteronomy 28:13) 
The Lord will make you the head and not the tail; you will always be at the top and never at the bottom. This will be true if you genuinely listen to the commandments of the Lord your God that I am giving you today, and are careful to keep and do them.

(Deuteronomy 28:14) 
Do not turn away from any of the words I am commanding you today, either to the right or to the left, so that you do not go after other gods or worship them.

(Deuteronomy 28:15) 
But if you do not genuinely listen to the voice of the Lord your God and are not careful to keep all His commandments and statutes, which I am giving you today, then all these curses will come upon you and find you.

(Deuteronomy 28:16) 
You will be cursed in the city, and you will be cursed in the countryside.

(Deuteronomy 28:17) 
Cursed will be your baskets and your storage bins.

(Deuteronomy 28:18) 
Cursed will be the children born to you, the produce from your land, and the offspring of your cattle and sheep.

(Deuteronomy 28:19) 
You will be cursed when you come in, and cursed when you go out.

(Deuteronomy 28:20) 
The Lord will send upon you curses of famine, thirst, and frustration in everything you attempt to do, until He crushes you and swiftly destroys you because of the evil you have done in forsaking Him.

(Deuteronomy 28:21) 
The Lord will strike you with plague until He completely removes you from the land you are entering to possess.

(Deuteronomy 28:22) 
The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, fever and inflammation, scorching heat, drought, blight, and mildew. These will pursue you until you perish.

(Deuteronomy 28:23) 
The sky above your head will be like bronze, and the ground beneath your feet will be like iron.

(Deuteronomy 28:24) 
The Lord will send dust and ashes raining down from the sky upon your land instead of rain, until you are utterly destroyed.

(Deuteronomy 28:25) 
The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will march out against them by one road, but you will flee from them in seven different directions. You will be scattered throughout all the kingdoms of the earth.

(Deuteronomy 28:26) 
Your corpses will become food for all the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth, with no one to bury them.

(Deuteronomy 28:27) 
The Lord will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors, with festering sores, and with an incurable itch and rash.

(Deuteronomy 28:28) 
The Lord will strike you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind.

(Deuteronomy 28:29) 
At noon, you will grope around like a blind person fumbling in the darkness, unable to find your way. You will be constantly wronged and oppressed by violence, with no one to rescue you.

(Deuteronomy 28:30) 
You will marry a woman, but another man will sleep with her. You will build a house, but you will not get to live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not gather its grapes.

(Deuteronomy 28:31) 
Your ox will be slaughtered before your very eyes, but you will not eat any of its meat. Your donkey will be stolen from you, right before your eyes, and it will not be returned to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and there will be no one to help you.

(Deuteronomy 28:32) 
Your sons and daughters will be given over to another people, and you will watch it happen, your eyes failing with longing for them day after day. You will be powerless to do anything.

(Deuteronomy 28:33) 
A people you do not know will eat the produce of your land and all the fruits of your labor. You will be constantly wronged and oppressed for the rest of your days.

(Deuteronomy 28:34) 
You will be driven mad by what you see with your own eyes.

(Deuteronomy 28:35) 
The Lord will strike you with painful, incurable boils on your knees and legs. These sores will cover you from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.

(Deuteronomy 28:36) 
The Lord will lead you and the king you set over you to a nation that neither you nor your ancestors have known. There you will serve other gods made of wood and stone.

(Deuteronomy 28:37) 
You will become an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples to whom the Lord will scatter you.

(Deuteronomy 28:38) 
You will sow much seed in your fields, but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it all.

(Deuteronomy 28:39) 
You will plant and cultivate vineyards, but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.

(Deuteronomy 28:40) 
You will have olive trees throughout your territory, but you will not anoint yourself with the oil from them. This is because your olives will drop off and perish before they ripen.

(Deuteronomy 29:1) 
These are the words of the sacred covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to establish with the children of Israel in the land of Moab. This covenant was made in addition to the earlier one He had already established with them on Mount Horeb.

(Deuteronomy 29:1) 
These are the terms of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to establish with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had already made with them at Mount Horeb.

(Deuteronomy 29:2) 
Then Moses called all of Israel together and said to them: “You yourselves saw everything the Lord did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,

(Deuteronomy 29:3) 
including the great trials your eyes witnessed—the signs and the immense wonders.

(Deuteronomy 29:4) 
But the Lord did not give you a heart that could truly understand, nor eyes that could truly see, nor ears that could truly hear, until this very day.

(Deuteronomy 29:5) 
I led you for forty years through the desert, and your clothes did not wear out, nor did your sandals become old and worn on your feet.

(Deuteronomy 29:6) 
You did not eat bread, nor did you drink wine or strong drink, so that you would know that I am the Lord your God.

(Deuteronomy 29:7) 
You came to this place, and Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, came out to fight us, and we defeated them.

(Deuteronomy 29:8) 
Then we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

(Deuteronomy 29:9) 
Therefore, keep the words of this covenant and do them, so that you may prosper in everything you undertake.

(Deuteronomy 29:10) 
All of you stand here today before the Lord your God: your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officials,

(Deuteronomy 29:11) 
all the people of Israel, together with your wives and children, and the foreigners living among you in your camps, from those who cut wood to those who draw water.

(Deuteronomy 29:12) 
You are here to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, and into the oath which the Lord your God is establishing with you today.

(Deuteronomy 29:13) 
He is doing this so that He may establish you as His own people, and that He Himself may be your God, just as He promised you, and just as He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

(Deuteronomy 29:14) 
I am not making this covenant with its oaths and confirmations only with you who are present today,

(Deuteronomy 29:15) 
but also with all who are present here with us and with those who are not present today, which refers to your future generations.

(Deuteronomy 29:16) 
For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we passed through the midst of the nations during your journey here.

(Deuteronomy 29:17) 
And you saw their detestable things and their idols—their wooden and stone images, and their silver and gold, which they worshipped.

(Deuteronomy 29:18) 
Beware lest there be among you a man or woman, or a family or tribe, whose heart turns away from the Lord our God today, to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you a root that sprouts forth poison and bitterness.

(Deuteronomy 29:19) 
If anyone hears the words of this oath and then blesses himself in his own heart, saying, 'I will have peace, even though I walk according to the stubbornness of my heart'—thinking that this will allow him to remove the sin of the drunken from the thirsty, meaning, to cause others to stumble by his own sin—

(Deuteronomy 29:20) 
then the Lord will not be willing to forgive him. Instead, the Lord's anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and all the curses written in this book will rest upon him. The Lord will utterly blot out his name from under the sky.

(Deuteronomy 29:21) 
The Lord will set him apart for destruction from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses and oaths written in this book of the Law.

(Deuteronomy 29:22) 
The generation to come, and the children born after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will see the plagues of that land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it.

(Deuteronomy 29:23) 
They will see that the whole land is sulfur and salt and burning fire, so that it cannot be sown, nor can anything sprout, nor can any plant grow in it—just like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His fierce anger and wrath.

(Deuteronomy 29:24) 
And all the nations will ask: 'Why did the Lord do this to this land? What is the meaning of this immense wrath and indignation of His fury?'

(Deuteronomy 29:25) 
And they will answer: 'Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, which He made with their fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt;'

(Deuteronomy 29:26) 
'and they served other gods and worshipped them—gods they did not know, and gods the Lord had not assigned to them.'

(Deuteronomy 29:27) 
Therefore, the fierce anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book;

(Deuteronomy 29:28) 
and He cast them out of their land in wrath, and in fierce anger, and in great indignation, and hurled them into another land, as is evident today.

(Deuteronomy 29:29) 
The secret things belong to the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may carry out all the words of this Law.

(Deuteronomy 29:30) 
When all these words that are written—both the blessing and the curse—come upon you, and you reflect on them in your heart among all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you,

(Deuteronomy 29:31) 
and when you return to Him and obey His commands, just as I am commanding you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul:

(Deuteronomy 29:32) 
then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the peoples among whom He had scattered you.

(Deuteronomy 29:33) 
Even if you have been dispersed to the farthest reaches under the sky, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.

(Deuteronomy 29:34) 
He will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. And He will bless you and make you more numerous than your fathers were.

(Deuteronomy 29:35) 
The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you may love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.

(Deuteronomy 29:36) 
And the Lord will turn all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who hate you and persecute you.

(Deuteronomy 29:37) 
But you will return, and you will listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and you will do all the commands that I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 29:38) 
And the Lord your God will make you abound in prosperity in all the work of your hands, and in the offspring of your body, and in the produce of your livestock, and in the fruitfulness of your land, and in the abundance of all your possessions. For the Lord will again delight in you for all good things, just as He delighted in your fathers.

(Deuteronomy 29:39) 
This will happen, however, only if you listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and keep His commands and His ceremonies which are written in this Law, and if you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

(Deuteronomy 29:40) 
For this commandment which I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away, nor is it impossible.

(Deuteronomy 30:1) 
Therefore, when all these words come upon you—all the blessings and all the curses which I have placed before you—and you then seriously consider them in your heart, while you are among all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you,

(Deuteronomy 30:2) 
and when you have returned to the Lord your God, and have obeyed His commandment with your entire being, just as I am commanding you today—both you and your children—with all your heart and with all your soul,

(Deuteronomy 30:3) 
then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes, and He will have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the nations among whom He previously scattered you.

(Deuteronomy 30:4) 
Even if you have been scattered to the farthest ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.

(Deuteronomy 30:5) 
He will bring you back into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will own it once again. You will be more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors ever were.

(Deuteronomy 30:6) 
The Lord your God will circumcise your heart, and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may truly live.

(Deuteronomy 30:7) 
Then all these curses will turn upon your enemies, and upon those who hate you and persecute you.

(Deuteronomy 30:8) 
But you will return and listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and you will carry out all the commandments that I am giving you today.

(Deuteronomy 30:9) 
And the Lord your God will make you abound in every work of your hands: in the children of your womb, in the offspring of your livestock, and in the abundance of your land, as well as in the generosity of all things.

(Deuteronomy 30:10) 
For the Lord will delight again over you for your good, just as He delighted over your ancestors,

(Deuteronomy 30:11) 
if only you listen to the voice of the Lord your God and keep His commandments and His ceremonies, which are written in this law, and you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

(Deuteronomy 30:12) 
For this commandment that I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away. It is not in the sky, so that you should have to say, "Who among us can ascend to the sky for us, and bring it down to us, so that we may hear it and do it?"

(Deuteronomy 30:13) 
Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you should complain and say, "Who among us can cross the sea for us, and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and do it?"

(Deuteronomy 30:14) 
Instead, the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.

(Deuteronomy 30:15) 
Consider that today I have set before you life and good, and conversely, death and evil.

(Deuteronomy 30:16) 
This choice is so that you may love the Lord your God, and walk in His ways, and keep His commandments, ceremonies, and judgments, so that you may live and multiply. And He will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.

(Deuteronomy 30:17) 
But if your heart turns away, and you refuse to listen, but instead are deceived by error to worship foreign gods and serve them,

(Deuteronomy 30:18) 
then I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not remain for long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.

(Deuteronomy 30:19) 
I call the universe and the earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse.

(Deuteronomy 30:20) 
Therefore, choose life, so that both you and your descendants may live. And this means you must love the Lord your God, obey His voice, and cling to Him. For He Himself is your life and the length of your days, so that you may dwell in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—to give to them.

(Deuteronomy 31:1) 
Moses went and spoke all these words to all of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:2) 
And he said to them: "I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I cannot lead you anymore, and the Lord has told me, 'You will not cross this Jordan River.'"

(Deuteronomy 31:3) 
"The Lord your God Himself will go before you. He will destroy these nations in your sight, and you will take possession of their land. And this Joshua will go before you, just as the Lord has commanded."

(Deuteronomy 31:4) 
"And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to all their lands, which He utterly destroyed."

(Deuteronomy 31:5) 
"Therefore, when He has destroyed even these nations and delivered them over to you, you will do to them exactly as I have commanded you."

(Deuteronomy 31:6) 
"Be strong and courageous. Do not fear them, nor be terrified by their presence, because the Lord your God Himself is your leader. He will not abandon you, nor will He ever forsake you."

(Deuteronomy 31:7) 
Moses then called Joshua and said to him in front of all Israel: "Be strong and courageous, for you will lead this people into the land that the Lord swore to their fathers to give them. And you will divide it among them by lot."

(Deuteronomy 31:8) 
"And the Lord, who is your leader, He Himself will be with you. He will not abandon you, nor will He ever forsake you. Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed."

(Deuteronomy 31:9) 
So Moses wrote down this entire law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:10) 
He then commanded them, saying: "At the end of every seven years, in the year of release, during the Feast of Tabernacles—which is the time of the Sabbatical year—"

(Deuteronomy 31:11) 
"When all of Israel gathers to appear before the Lord your God in the holy place He chooses, you shall read the words of this entire law before all of Israel, with everyone listening intently."

(Deuteronomy 31:12) 
"Gather the people: men, women, children, and the foreigners living within your towns—so that they may listen, learn, and fear the Lord your God, and diligently observe all the words of this law, carrying them out in their actions."

(Deuteronomy 31:13) 
"And their children, who do not yet know the Law, may hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God all the days you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to inhabit."

(Deuteronomy 31:14) 
The Lord then said to Moses: "Look, the days of your death are near. Call Joshua, and stand with him in the Tent of Meeting—the Tabernacle of Testimony—so that I may give him his charge." So Moses and Joshua went and stood inside the Tent of Meeting.

(Deuteronomy 31:15) 
And the Lord appeared there in a pillar of cloud, which stood directly over the entrance of the Tabernacle.

(Deuteronomy 31:16) 
The Lord then said to Moses: "Behold, you will soon lie down with your fathers in death. And this people, when they settle in the land they are about to enter, will rise up and commit spiritual adultery by pursuing foreign gods. They will abandon Me there and break the covenant I have made with them."

(Deuteronomy 31:17) 
"And My wrath will burn fiercely against them on that day. I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will be utterly consumed. All sorts of evils and afflictions will find them, so that on that day, they will say: 'Surely, because God is not with me, these evils have come upon me.'"

(Deuteronomy 31:18) 
"But I will certainly hide My face from them on that day because of all the evils they have committed, for they will have pursued foreign gods."

(Deuteronomy 31:19) 
"Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Have them memorize it and sing it, so that this song may serve as a perpetual witness for Me against the children of Israel."

(Deuteronomy 31:20) 
"For I will bring them into the land which I swore to their fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey. They will eat, be satisfied, and grow prosperous. But then they will turn to foreign gods and serve them. They will invalidate My covenant and mock it."

(Deuteronomy 31:21) 
"And when many evils and afflictions find them, this song will stand as a witness against them, for it will reveal their inner thoughts and what they were planning even before it happened. For I know their intentions, even now, while they are still living in the desert land."

(Deuteronomy 31:22) 
So Moses wrote that song on that very day and taught it to the children of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:23) 
And He—the Lord—gave a charge to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying: "Be strong and courageous, for you will lead the children of Israel into the land which I promised them by oath, and I will be with you."

(Deuteronomy 31:24) 
Therefore, after Moses had finished writing all the words of this entire law in a scroll,

(Deuteronomy 31:25) 
He commanded the Levites, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying:

(Deuteronomy 31:26) 
"Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you."

(Deuteronomy 31:27) 
"For I know your stubbornness and your hard-headed obstinacy. Even while I am still alive and walking among you, you have always been contentious against the Lord. How much more rebellious will you be after I am dead!"

(Deuteronomy 31:28) 
"Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I may speak these words in the hearing of everyone, and call the sky and the earth to witness against them."

(Deuteronomy 31:29) 
"For I know that after my death, you will act wickedly and quickly turn aside from the path that I have commanded you. And evils will certainly befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of your own hands—your idols."

(Deuteronomy 31:30) 
So Moses spoke the words of this song in the hearing of the entire assembly of Israel, and he completed it fully.

(Deuteronomy 31:1) 
And Moses went, and he spoke all these words to the whole nation of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:2) 
He said to them, 'I am one hundred and twenty years old today, and I can no longer lead you out or bring you in, especially since the Lord has already told me that I will not cross this Jordan River.'

(Deuteronomy 31:3) 
So the Lord your God Himself will go across before you, and He Himself will destroy all these nations in front of you so that you can take possession of their lands. And Joshua, here, will cross over ahead of you, just as the Lord has promised.

(Deuteronomy 31:4) 
And the Lord will deal with these nations just as He dealt with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and with all of their land, whom He utterly destroyed.

(Deuteronomy 31:5) 
Therefore, when He delivers even these nations to you, you shall do to them just as I have commanded you.

(Deuteronomy 31:6) 
Be strong and take courage! Do not be afraid, nor be terrified by their armies, because the Lord your God Himself is your leader. He will not leave you, nor will He ever abandon you.

(Deuteronomy 31:7) 
Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, 'Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring this people into the land that the Lord swore to their fathers that He would give them, and you shall divide it among them by lot.'

(Deuteronomy 31:8) 
And the Lord, who is your leader, He Himself will go before you. He Himself will accomplish this task, and He will not leave you nor abandon you. Do not be afraid, nor be terrified.

(Deuteronomy 31:9) 
So Moses wrote this entire Law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:10) 
And he commanded them, saying, 'After every seven years, in the year of remission —the year of release from debts—, during the Feast of Tabernacles,'

(Deuteronomy 31:11) 
'When all of Israel comes to appear before the presence of the Lord your God in the specific place that the Lord will choose, you shall read this entire Law aloud for all of Israel to hear.'

(Deuteronomy 31:12) 
'Gather the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners who live within your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, and carefully observe all the words of this Law.'

(Deuteronomy 31:13) 
'And so that their children, who have not yet learned the Law, may hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God all the days you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.'

(Deuteronomy 31:14) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, the days of your death are near. Call Joshua, and both of you present yourselves in the Tent of Testimony so that I may give him commands.'

(Deuteronomy 31:15) 
So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the Tent of Testimony.

(Deuteronomy 31:16) 
And the Lord appeared there in a pillar of cloud, which stood over the entrance of the Tent of Testimony.

(Deuteronomy 31:17) 
Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, you are about to die and join your fathers. And this people will then rise up and commit spiritual fornication by chasing after foreign gods in the land they are entering to inhabit. They will abandon Me and break the covenant that I have made with them.'

(Deuteronomy 31:18) 
And My furious anger will be kindled against them on that day. I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will become prey. Many evils and afflictions will befall them, so much so that they will say on that day, 'Surely these evils have befallen me because God is not with me.'

(Deuteronomy 31:19) 
Now therefore, write this song for yourselves and teach it to the children of Israel, so that they may remember it and sing it, and so that this song may serve as a witness for Me against the children of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:20) 
For when they enter the land that I swore to their fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey—and they eat, become full, and grow prosperous, they will then abandon the Lord their God and break His covenant.

(Deuteronomy 31:21) 
And when such a multitude of evils and afflictions befalls them, then the testimony of this song will serve as a reminder to them. For I truly know their thoughts, which are even now present in their hearts, even before I bring them into the land which I promised to many with an oath.

(Deuteronomy 31:22) 
So Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the children of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 31:23) 
And He —God— commanded Joshua, the son of Nun, and said, 'Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you.'

(Deuteronomy 31:24) 
So after Moses finished writing all the words of this Law in a scroll,

(Deuteronomy 31:25) 
he gave a command to the Levites, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying:

(Deuteronomy 31:26) 
'Take this book of the Law and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you.'

(Deuteronomy 31:27) 
'For I know your obstinacy and your extreme stubbornness. Even while I am still alive with you today, you have always acted rebelliously against the Lord. How much more will you do so when I am dead?'

(Deuteronomy 31:28) 
'Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and I will call the universe and the earth to witness against them.'

(Deuteronomy 31:29) 
'For I know that after my death you will act wickedly and quickly turn aside from the path that I commanded you. And evils will surely befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and provoke Him to anger through the idols that you have made with your own hands.'

(Deuteronomy 31:30) 
So Moses spoke the words of this song in the hearing of the entire assembly of Israel, and he completed it even to the end.

(Deuteronomy 32:1) 
O you heavens, hear what I am about to say. Let the entire earth listen to the words from My mouth.

(Deuteronomy 32:2) 
May My teaching pour down like the rain, refreshing and abundant. May My words flow gently like the dew. May it be like a heavy shower upon tender plants, and like drops upon the green grass.

(Deuteronomy 32:3) 
For I will proclaim the Name of the Lord. Ascribe greatness to our God!

(Deuteronomy 32:4) 
God's works are perfect, and all His ways are just judgments. He is a faithful God, without any iniquity—He is righteous and upright.

(Deuteronomy 32:5) 
They have sinned against Him, and they are not His pure children, but rather a wicked and perverse generation.

(Deuteronomy 32:6) 
Is this how you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who possesses you, who made you, and who formed you?

(Deuteronomy 32:7) 
Remember the ancient days, consider each past generation. Ask your father, and he will tell you; ask your elders, and they will explain it to you.

(Deuteronomy 32:8) 
When the Most High divided the nations, when He separated the descendants of Adam, He set the boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 32:9) 
For the Lord's portion is His people: Jacob is the designated portion of His inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 32:10) 
He found him in a deserted land, in a place of horror and vast wilderness. He led him around, and taught him, and guarded him like the pupil of His own eye.

(Deuteronomy 32:11) 
Like an eagle that stirs its young to fly, hovering over them, it spreads its wings, takes them up, and carries them on its shoulders.

(Deuteronomy 32:12) 
The Lord alone was his guide; and there was no foreign god with him.

(Deuteronomy 32:13) 
He established him on the high land, so that he might eat the fruits of the fields, so that he might draw honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone.

(Deuteronomy 32:14) 
He provided butter from the herd, and milk from the sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams of Bashan, and goats, with the finest wheat. And he drank the pure blood of the grape, the most unmixed wine.

(Deuteronomy 32:15) 
But the Beloved grew fat and kicked back against Him. He grew fat, became plump, and became broad. He abandoned God, his Maker, and departed from God, his Savior.

(Deuteronomy 32:16) 
They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods, and they stirred Him to anger with their abominations.

(Deuteronomy 32:17) 
They sacrificed to demons, and not to God—to gods they did not know. They were new, recently introduced gods, whom their fathers had not worshipped.

(Deuteronomy 32:18) 
You have forsaken God who begot you, and you have forgotten the Lord, your Creator.

(Deuteronomy 32:19) 
The Lord saw this, and He was provoked to anger, because His sons and His daughters provoked Him.

(Deuteronomy 32:20) 
And He said: 'I will hide My face from them, and I will see what their end will be. For they are a perverse generation, and children who are unfaithful.'

(Deuteronomy 32:21) 
They provoked Me with what was not God, and they roused Me to anger with their worthless idols. So I will provoke them with what is not a people, and I will irritate them with a foolish nation.

(Deuteronomy 32:22) 
For a fire has been kindled by My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths of hell itself. It will devour the earth with its harvest, and consume the very foundations of the mountains.

(Deuteronomy 32:23) 
I will heap evils upon them, and I will exhaust My arrows against them.

(Deuteronomy 32:24) 
They will be consumed by hunger, and the birds of prey will devour them with the bitterest bite. I will send against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the fury of creeping things that crawl upon the earth.

(Deuteronomy 32:25) 
Outside, the sword will bring desolation, and inside, terror. Both young men and virgins, infants and old men alike, will perish.

(Deuteronomy 32:26) 
And I said: 'Where is their offspring? I will cause their memory to cease from among men.'

(Deuteronomy 32:27) 
But I postponed it because of the wrath of their enemies, lest their foes become arrogant and say: 'Our hand is mighty, and it was not the Lord who did all these things.'

(Deuteronomy 32:28) 
For they are a nation without counsel and without understanding.

(Deuteronomy 32:29) 
Oh, that they were wise, that they understood, and that they would foresee their latter end!

(Deuteronomy 32:30) 
How could one man pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their God had sold them off, and the Lord had shut them up?

(Deuteronomy 32:31) 
For their god is not like our God—even our enemies judge this to be true.

(Deuteronomy 32:32) 
Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters are most bitter.

(Deuteronomy 32:33) 
Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the incurable poison of asps.

(Deuteronomy 32:34) 
Are not these things stored up with Me, and sealed in My treasuries?

(Deuteronomy 32:35) 
Vengeance belongs to Me, and I will repay them in due time, when their foot slips. The day of their destruction is near, and their appointed times hasten to come.

(Deuteronomy 32:36) 
For the Lord will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants. He will see that their power is weakened, and that those who were imprisoned have failed, and that the remaining ones have been consumed.

(Deuteronomy 32:37) 
And He will say: 'Where are their gods, in whom they placed their trust?'

(Deuteronomy 32:38) 
'Those who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations, let them arise and help you! Let them protect you in your time of need!'

(Deuteronomy 32:39) 
See now that I alone am He, and there is no other God besides Me. I kill, and I make alive. I strike, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of My hand.

(Deuteronomy 32:40) 
I will lift My hand to the heavens and declare: 'As I live forever!'

(Deuteronomy 32:1) 
Listen, you created universe, to what I speak. Let the earth hear the words that come from My mouth.

(Deuteronomy 32:2) 
Let My teaching be absorbed like gentle rain, and My words distill like dew, like showers upon the tender grass, and like drops upon the growing plants.

(Deuteronomy 32:3) 
For I will proclaim the name of the Lord God. Therefore, give all glory and majesty to our God!

(Deuteronomy 32:4) 
All of God’s works are perfect, and all of His ways are just. God is faithful and without any evil; He is righteous and upright.

(Deuteronomy 32:5) 
They have sinned against Him, and are not truly His children, but instead are stained by their perversity: a generation that is crooked and twisted.

(Deuteronomy 32:6) 
Is this how you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who possesses you, and made you, and created you into existence?

(Deuteronomy 32:7) 
Remember the days of old. Consider each generation, one after another. Ask your father, and he will tell you. Ask your elders, and they will explain it to you.

(Deuteronomy 32:8) 
When the Most High God divided the nations, when He separated the children of Adam, He established the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.

(Deuteronomy 32:9) 
For the Lord’s portion is His people; Jacob is the measuring line of His inheritance.

(Deuteronomy 32:10) 
He found them in a desert land, in a place of terrifying emptiness and vast desolation. He surrounded them and taught them, and He guarded them as the apple of His eye.

(Deuteronomy 32:11) 
Like an eagle stirring up its nest, teaching its young to fly, hovering over them, it spreads its wings, takes them up, and carries them on its shoulders.

(Deuteronomy 32:12) 
The Lord alone was their leader, and there was no foreign god with them.

(Deuteronomy 32:13) 
He set them on the high places of the earth so that they might eat the produce of the fields, and that they might suck honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone.

(Deuteronomy 32:14) 
He gave them butter from the herd, and milk from the sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams from Bashan, and goats, with the finest wheat marrow. They drank the purest blood of the grape, which is wine.

(Deuteronomy 32:15) 
But My beloved Israel grew fat and kicked against Me! Having grown fat, being well-fed, and expanding in prosperity, they abandoned God their Maker and turned away from God their Savior.

(Deuteronomy 32:16) 
They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods, and they stirred Him to anger with their abominations.

(Deuteronomy 32:17) 
They sacrificed to demons, not to God—to gods they did not know, newly arrived ones, recently come into being, whom their fathers had not worshipped.

(Deuteronomy 32:18) 
You forgot God, who gave birth to you; you forgot the Lord, your Creator.

(Deuteronomy 32:19) 
The Lord saw this, and He was moved to anger, because His sons and daughters provoked Him.

(Deuteronomy 32:20) 
And He said: 'I will hide My face from them, and I will see what their end will be. For they are a perverse generation, and they are unfaithful children.'

(Deuteronomy 32:21) 
They provoked Me to jealousy with that which was not God, and they angered Me with their empty idols. So I will provoke them with a people who are not a people, and I will anger them with a foolish nation.

(Deuteronomy 32:22) 
For a fire has been kindled in My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths of hell. It will devour the earth with its harvest, and it will consume the foundations of the mountains.

(Deuteronomy 32:23) 
I will heap evils upon them, and I will exhaust My arrows against them.

(Deuteronomy 32:24) 
They will be consumed by famine, and birds will devour them with the bitterest bite. I will send the teeth of wild beasts among them, with the furious venom of creeping things upon the earth, even serpents.

(Deuteronomy 32:25) 
Outside, the sword will destroy them, and inside, terror will consume them—both young men and virgins, infants with old men.

(Deuteronomy 32:26) 
And I said: 'Where are they now? I will make their memory cease from among humanity.'

(Deuteronomy 32:27) 
But I held back My judgment because of the anger of their enemies, lest the adversaries become arrogant and say: 'Our own powerful hand did all this, and not the Lord.'

(Deuteronomy 32:28) 
For they are a nation without counsel and without understanding.

(Deuteronomy 32:29) 
If only they were wise, and understood, and would consider their latter end!

(Deuteronomy 32:30) 
How could one man pursue a thousand, and two men put ten thousand to flight? Is it not because their God has sold them, and the Lord has delivered them up?

(Deuteronomy 32:31) 
For their gods are not like our God; even our enemies themselves are witnesses of this.

(Deuteronomy 32:32) 
For their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of bitterness, and their clusters are most bitter.

(Deuteronomy 32:33) 
Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the incurable poison of vipers.

(Deuteronomy 32:34) 
Are not these things stored up with Me, and sealed in My treasures?

(Deuteronomy 32:35) 
Vengeance belongs to Me, and I will repay them in due time, when their foot slips. For the day of their destruction is near, and the appointed times are hastening to come.

(Deuteronomy 32:36) 
For the Lord will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants when He sees that their power is gone, and that both the imprisoned and the free have vanished and are consumed.

(Deuteronomy 32:37) 
And He will say: 'Where are their gods, in whom they placed their trust?'

(Deuteronomy 32:38) 
Those who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations: 'Let them arise and help you, and protect you in your time of need!'

(Deuteronomy 32:39) 
See now that I alone am God, and there is no other God besides Me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. And there is no one who can rescue from My hand.

(Deuteronomy 32:40) 
For I will lift My hand to the created universe and declare: 'As I live forever!'

(Deuteronomy 33:1) 
This is the final blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the children of Israel just before his death.

(Deuteronomy 33:2) 
And Moses said: "The Lord God came from Mount Sinai—the place of the Law—and dawned upon us from Mount Seir, and revealed Himself from Mount Paran, bringing with Him thousands of His holy angels.

(Deuteronomy 33:3) 
Truly, He loved His people Israel. All of His holy ones are in His powerful hand, and those who approach Him and follow His ways will receive His divine teaching.

(Deuteronomy 33:4) 
Moses gave us the Law—His divine instruction—as a spiritual inheritance for all the descendants of Jacob.

(Deuteronomy 33:5) 
And there will be a King among the upright people of Israel when the leaders of the tribes gather together.

(Deuteronomy 33:6) 
Moses blessed the tribe of Reuben: "May Reuben live and not perish, even if their numbers remain small among the other tribes."

(Deuteronomy 33:7) 
And this is the blessing for Judah: "Hear, O Lord, the plea of Judah, and bring him back to his people after battle. Let his hands fight powerfully for him, and may You be his helper against all his enemies."

(Deuteronomy 33:8) 
And to Levi, Moses said: "Your spiritual perfection and Your divine teaching belong to Your holy man—the high priest—whom You tested during trials and judged at the waters of Meribah, where the people contended against You."

(Deuteronomy 33:9) 
"The Levites, for Your sake, were willing to disregard their own father and mother, and to disown their own brothers. They did this because they guarded Your holy words and diligently kept Your covenant."

(Deuteronomy 33:10) 
"They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Law to Israel. They will offer incense as a pleasing aroma when Your presence is manifested, and they will offer burnt offerings on Your altar."

(Deuteronomy 33:11) 
"Bless, O Lord, the strength of the tribe of Levi, and accept the sacred works of their hands. Strike down their enemies so they may never rise against them again."

(Deuteronomy 33:12) 
And to Benjamin, Moses said: "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell securely in His presence. He will remain there as in a sacred chamber all the day, and the Lord will rest between his shoulders, protecting him."

(Deuteronomy 33:13) 
And to Joseph, Moses said: "May his land be blessed by the Lord, producing fruit from the heavens—from the rains and the dew—and from the deep waters that lie beneath the earth."

(Deuteronomy 33:14) 
"May his land be blessed with the finest fruits ripened by the sun and the moon, with the choicest produce from the ancient mountains and the fruit of the everlasting hills."

(Deuteronomy 33:15) 
"May the blessing of Him who appeared in the burning bush come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of him who was set apart from his brothers—meaning Jacob's favored son."

(Deuteronomy 33:16) 
"His glory is like the firstborn bull, his horns are like the horns of a wild ox. With them he shall push the nations to the ends of the earth. These are the thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh—Joseph's two tribes."

(Deuteronomy 33:17) 
And to Zebulun, Moses said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, as you go out for commerce, and rejoice, Issachar, in your settled dwelling places."

(Deuteronomy 33:18) 
"They will summon peoples to the sacred mountain to offer sacrifices of righteousness there. For they will draw from the abundance of the seas as if it were milk, and discover the hidden treasures buried in the sand—resources from the coast."

(Deuteronomy 33:19) 
And to Gad, Moses said: "Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's territory! He lies down like a lion, ready to seize his prey—both arm and crown—from his enemies."

(Deuteronomy 33:20) 
"He chose his own best portion of land, for there a leader's share was reserved for him. He marched with the chiefs of the people. He executed the Lord God's justice for Israel and His righteous decrees with Him, joining his forces with the thousands of the other tribes."

(Deuteronomy 33:21) 
And to Dan, Moses said: "Dan is a young lion, a lion's cub springing forth from Bashan."

(Deuteronomy 33:22) 
And to Naphtali, Moses said: "Naphtali is abundantly satisfied with the Lord's favor and full of His blessing. He will possess the coastal region to the south."

(Deuteronomy 33:23) 
And to Asher, Moses said: "Blessed be Asher above all sons! May he be favored by his brothers, and may he dip his foot in oil—symbolizing abundant olive oil from his land."

(Deuteronomy 33:24) 
"His shoes will be made of iron and bronze, providing strength. As your days of youth are, so shall your days of old age be—full of vigor and blessing."

(Deuteronomy 33:25) 
There is no God like the God of Israel, who rides across the universe to come to your aid, majestic in His clouds.

(Deuteronomy 33:26) 
His dwelling is in the highest heavens, and His everlasting arms support you from beneath. He drove out your enemy before you and commanded, 'Destroy them!'

(Deuteronomy 33:27) 
So Israel dwelt securely, alone and without fear. The fountain of Jacob—meaning his descendants—lived in a land of grain and new wine, and the skies above watered it with dew.

(Deuteronomy 33:28) 
Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord God? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your glory. Your enemies will deny your power, but you will tread upon their necks.

(Deuteronomy 34:1) 
Moses then went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. The Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,

(Deuteronomy 34:2) 
all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, stretching as far as the western sea, which is the Mediterranean.

(Deuteronomy 34:3) 
and the southern region of the land, along with the whole plain of Jericho, known as the city of palm trees, stretching all the way to Zoar.

(Deuteronomy 34:4) 
The Lord then said to him: "This is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give to their descendants. You have seen it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over into it."

(Deuteronomy 34:5) 
So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, in obedience to the Lord's command.

(Deuteronomy 34:6) 
And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor. No one knows the exact location of his burial place to this very day.

(Deuteronomy 34:7) 
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyesight had not dimmed, nor had his physical strength diminished.

(Deuteronomy 34:8) 
The children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab for thirty days, and the days of mourning and lamentation for Moses were thus completed.

(Deuteronomy 34:9) 
Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands upon him. The children of Israel obeyed him, doing exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

(Deuteronomy 34:10) 
And there has not arisen a prophet in Israel since like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face—meaning, in intimate, direct communication.

(Deuteronomy 34:11) 
This refers to all the miraculous signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all his land.

(Deuteronomy 34:12) 
It also refers to the entire display of God's strong hand and the great and terrible things that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
