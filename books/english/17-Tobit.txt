(Tobit 1:1) 
Tobias was from the tribe of Naphtali and from the city of Naphtali, which is located in upper Galilee, above Asher, beyond the road that leads to the west, and to its right is the city of Sephet.

(Tobit 1:2) 
When he was taken captive during the reign of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, he himself, even while placed in captivity, did not abandon the way of truth and righteous living.

(Tobit 1:3) 
So much so that everything he could acquire, he shared daily with his captive brothers who were from his own lineage.

(Tobit 1:4) 
And even though he was the youngest of all in the tribe of Naphtali, he still did not act childishly in his deeds.

(Tobit 1:5) 
Indeed, when everyone else went to worship the golden calves that Jeroboam, the king of Israel, had made, he alone avoided the company of all of them.

(Tobit 1:6) 
Instead, he went to Jerusalem, to the Temple of the Lord, and there he worshipped the Lord God of Israel, faithfully bringing all of his first fruits and his tithes.

(Tobit 1:7) 
So much so that in the third year, he would distribute the entire tithe to proselytes and to those who came as strangers.

(Tobit 1:8) 
The boy Tobias performed these and similar actions according to the law of God.

(Tobit 1:9) 
However, when he had gone into captivity during the reign of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, even though he was placed in captivity, he did not turn away from God.

(Tobit 1:10) 
Instead, he continued to distribute everything he could acquire to the other captives.

(Tobit 1:11) 
And he did not want to eat from the food of the Gentiles.

(Tobit 1:12) 
And because he remembered the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favor in the sight of King Shalmaneser.

(Tobit 1:13) 
And God gave him the power to go wherever he wished, having freedom to do whatever he desired.

(Tobit 1:14) 
Therefore, he went among all those who were in captivity, and, admonishing them on what was beneficial for their souls and bodies, he gave money to each one as much as he could afford.

(Tobit 1:15) 
Afterward, when King Shalmaneser had died and his son Sennacherib reigned in his place, Tobias’s ways were disturbed—meaning his previous freedom to travel and help others was restricted.

(Tobit 1:16) 
And he could not go to the Jews, the children of Israel, except by taking all his possessions with him, implying a change in his status or the law.

(Tobit 1:17) 
But he also ensured that he would never eat from the food of the Gentiles, maintaining his ritual purity.

(Tobit 1:18) 
In this matter too, he gave many alms to his brothers from his own lineage.

(Tobit 1:19) 
And he gave clothing to the naked, and he gave bread to the hungry, and he gave drink to the thirsty.

(Tobit 1:20) 
And when King Sennacherib saw him and knew all that he had done for his brothers, the children of Israel, he ordered him to be put to death.

(Tobit 1:21) 
And he was already apprehended, and all his property was being plundered, and he himself was being led to his death. But almighty God saved him.

(Tobit 1:22) 
And in those days, when the children of Israel had been carried away from Jerusalem and had come to Nineveh—this sets the historical context for the events of the book.

(Tobit 2:1) 
After these events, when I had returned to my home and my good fortune was restored to me, and all tribulation had been removed from me, I prepared a great feast with much joy for the wedding of my son Tobias.

(Tobit 2:2) 
When the time for our meal was complete, I said to my son Tobias: "Go, and bring in whoever you find among our brethren who are captives in Nineveh and who still remember the Lord. I will wait for you here."

(Tobit 2:3) 
So Tobias went out and searched for the poor among the children of Israel. When he returned, he reported to me, saying: "Father, one of our Israelite brethren lies suffocated in the street."

(Tobit 2:4) 
I immediately jumped up from my couch, left the meal, and did not even touch it. I went to the man, carefully removed his body from the street, and placed it in a house until the sun would set.

(Tobit 2:5) 
Then I returned home, washed myself, and ate my meal with deep sorrow.

(Tobit 2:6) 
I then recalled the words of the prophet Amos, just as he had spoken: "Your feast days shall be turned into mourning, and all your joys into sadness."

(Tobit 2:7) 
I wept, and when the sun had set, I dug a grave and buried him.

(Tobit 2:8) 
My neighbors then rebuked me, saying: "Do you not fear for your life now? For this very reason, you were already sought out for execution, and you barely escaped the death sentence! And yet, you are burying the dead again?"

(Tobit 2:9) 
But I was terrified by their warning. I hid the body I had just buried, and restrained my true feelings, feigning indifference in public.

(Tobit 2:10) 
And that night, after I had buried the dead man, I washed myself and went into my upper room near the wall. I lay down to sleep with my face covered because of the heat.

(Tobit 2:11) 
I do not know if it was from a bird's nest in the wall or from somewhere else, but warm sparrow droppings fell directly onto my eyes, and I became blind.

(Tobit 2:12) 
My son Tobias (or perhaps, a man named Tobias) brought physicians to treat me, but it did not help me. Indeed, from that time when my blindness first afflicted me, I remained alive for forty years.

(Tobit 2:13) 
My wife Anna, however, worked day and night at the loom, and from the labor of her hands, she provided our daily sustenance.

(Tobit 2:14) 
It happened that a blind head of a household sent a goat kid to her as payment for her labor.

(Tobit 2:1) 
After these events, when I had returned to my home, and my wife Anna and my son Tobias were with me again, on the feast day of Pentecost—which is also called the feast of weeks—a good dinner was prepared for me, and I reclined at the table to eat.

(Tobit 2:2) 
When I saw how much food there was, I said to my son Tobias: “Go and find any poor person from our Jewish brothers and sisters in Nineveh—someone who keeps the Lord in their heart with complete devotion—and bring that person here so they can eat with me.”

(Tobit 2:3) 
And Tobias returned and told me, saying: “Father, one of our Jewish brothers has been murdered and is lying in the street. The king has already ordered that his body be thrown out and not buried.”

(Tobit 2:4) 
I immediately got up and left the feast. Before I could eat anything, I carried the body from the street and placed it inside one of the houses until the sun would set.

(Tobit 2:5) 
Then I returned home, washed myself to cleanse the ritual impurity, and ate my meal, but I was filled with great sorrow.

(Tobit 2:6) 
I remembered the words of the prophet Amos, just as he had spoken: “Your feast days will be turned into weeping, and all your joys will become sorrow.”

(Tobit 2:7) 
So I wept. And when the sun had finally set—marking the end of the day—I then dug a grave and buried the man.

(Tobit 2:8) 
All my neighbors mocked me, saying: “Look, he still isn't afraid! He almost died because of this before, yet he still buries the dead.”

(Tobit 2:9) 
That same night, after I had washed myself and gone into my courtyard, I lay down against the courtyard wall. My face was uncovered because of the heat. I didn't realize that there were sparrows on the wall above me.

(Tobit 2:10) 
Then their warm droppings fell onto my eyes, and I became completely blind.

(Tobit 2:11) 
I wept over this, and when I knew that the blindness would remain with me because of the sparrows' droppings, I went to doctors. But the more they applied their eye-salve to me, the more my eyes were irritated and blinded by the droppings.

(Tobit 2:12) 
And the Lord brought suffering upon me, making the wound of my afflictions even worse. As I was now blind, my wife Anna worked day and night to support us.

(Tobit 2:13) 
She truly worked hard, just as women typically do, by spinning wool and providing food for our family through the labor of her own hands.

(Tobit 2:14) 
And so it happened that a young goat was given to her—a kid from the goats—which I strongly suspected she had stolen. When I—her husband, as she would have referred to me—rebuked her, she cried out: “I don't know where it came from!” And I said to her: “Even if you claim you don't know where it came from, you must return it to whomever you stole it from! It is not right for us to eat stolen things. Go and give it back to them!”

(Tobit 3:1) 
Then Tobit, filled with sorrow, groaned deeply and began to pray with tears, saying:

(Tobit 3:2) 
You are truly just, Lord, and all Your judgments are righteous, and all Your ways are filled with mercy, truth, and fair judgment. And now, Lord, remember me. Do not take vengeance for my own sins, nor recall the transgressions of my parents or me.

(Tobit 3:3) 
For neither we nor our parents obeyed Your commandments. Therefore, we have been given over to plunder, to captivity, to death, to be spoken of as a tale, and to be a reproach among all the nations where You have scattered us.

(Tobit 3:4) 
And now, Your many judgments are true, such that You have brought upon me what is deserved according to my sins and those of my parents. For we did not keep Your commands, nor did we walk in Your truth.

(Tobit 3:5) 
And now, Lord, deal with me according to Your goodness, and command my spirit to be received in peace. For it is better for me to die than to live.

(Tobit 3:6) 
On that same day, it happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in the city of Rages in Media, was also being tormented with insults by her father’s household servants.

(Tobit 3:7) 
This was because she had been married to seven men, and the demon Asmodeus had killed them each before they could ever consummate their marriage with her.

(Tobit 3:8) 
When her servants, therefore, reproached her, saying: "You are the one who kills your husbands! Look, you have already been married to seven men, and you have not helped any of them survive!"

(Tobit 3:9) 
"Why should we suffer because of you? Go and join them. We hope never to see a son or daughter from you."

(Tobit 3:10) 
After hearing these things, Sarah went up to the upper room of her house. For three days and three nights she neither ate nor drank.

(Tobit 3:11) 
But she prayed, and with tears, she implored God to free her from this painful reproach.

(Tobit 3:12) 
And when her prayer was finished, she praised the Lord, saying: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, and blessed is Your Name forever. And may all Your works bless You throughout all ages."

(Tobit 3:13) 
And now, Lord, I turn my face to You, and to You alone do I look.

(Tobit 3:14) 
And I implore You, that in every tribulation, when it pleases You, You would receive this spirit of mine.

(Tobit 3:15) 
For I have heard these reproaches, and now I know that I shall never find mercy unless I die.

(Tobit 3:16) 
I have one and only one father, and there is no hope for me in his inheritance after what has happened.

(Tobit 3:17) 
And since I have been married to seven men, and not even one of them remains alive, death alone is left for me.

(Tobit 3:1) 
Then Tobit let out a deep sigh, and with tears, he began to pray, saying:

(Tobit 3:2) 
“You are just, O Lord, and all Your judgments are just, and all Your ways are mercy, and truth, and judgment. And now, O Lord, remember me, and do not take vengeance for my sins, nor recall the transgressions of my parents or me.

(Tobit 3:3) 
Because we have not obeyed Your precepts, for this reason we have been handed over to plunder, and to captivity, and to death, and to a disgraceful story—a tale of our infamy—and to every blasphemy among all the nations where You have scattered us.

(Tobit 3:4) 
And now, O Lord, Your judgments are severe and just, because we have not acted according to Your precepts, and we have not walked in truth before You. And now, what do You wish me to do?

(Tobit 3:5) 
Recall my spirit, and take it, so that I may no longer be upon the earth. For it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard reproach and have had much cause for sadness.”

(Tobit 3:6) 
And similarly, it happened to Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in Rages of Media. For she also was ridiculed by her own servants, because she had been given to seven men, and Asmodeus, the demon, had killed them before they could know her intimately as husband and wife.

(Tobit 3:7) 
Therefore, when she rejected the thought of a husband and wished to strangle herself, she said: “Indeed, I have no hope left concerning men.

(Tobit 3:8) 
Let me not be, O Lord, from the lineage of those who blaspheme You, or who despise You.”

(Tobit 3:9) 
And she prayed to You, and said: “Blessed are You, my God, and blessed is Your name forever through all ages.

(Tobit 3:10) 
For You have blessed humanity, so that we might do Your will in all things that exist, and in those things that were made through You, and in those that are now, and those that are to come.

(Tobit 3:11) 
And now, O Lord, I direct my eyes to You, and I lift my face to You, that You may free me from this shame, and receive me into eternal rest.

(Tobit 3:12) 
For You know, O Lord, that I am pure from all sexual intercourse with a man, and that I have not defiled my name.

(Tobit 3:13) 
And You know that I have always glorified the name of my father, and the name of my brothers, and I have always invoked You, and I have never despaired of You.

(Tobit 3:14) 
And now, O Lord, free me from this shame, and receive my spirit in peace.

(Tobit 3:15) 
For You are the One who accepts every prayer, and You are the One who hears my prayer, and do not despise me.

(Tobit 3:16) 
And the prayer of both was heard in the presence of the glory of the Most High God.

(Tobit 3:17) 
And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael, was sent on a mission to heal both of them, whose prayers ascended at the same time, to one place, into the presence of the Lord of Hosts.

(Tobit 4:1) 
So, after all these events, when Tobias’s eye illness became very severe and could not be cured, he called his son Tobias to himself and spoke to him.

(Tobit 4:2) 
My son, when I am dead, bury me. And honor your mother all the days of her life; do not forget the dangers she suffered for you, carrying you in her womb.

(Tobit 4:3) 
And when she herself has also reached the end of her life, bury her next to me.

(Tobit 4:4) 
All the days of your life, keep the Lord in your mind, and do not desire to sin or to transgress His commandments. All the days of your life, do good, and no evil will come upon you.

(Tobit 4:5) 
For if you act in truth—that is, if you are faithful to God—your works will prosper in truth, and so will the works of all who do good.

(Tobit 4:6) 
To everyone who works righteousness, give from your substance—that is, your possessions and wealth. And do not turn your face away from any poor person, for God Himself will not turn His face away from you if you are in need.

(Tobit 4:7) 
According to your substance—your means—give alms. If you have much, give much willingly; if you have little, make an effort to share even that little.

(Tobit 4:8) 
For you are storing up a good treasure for yourself for the day of need—a treasure with God that will endure.

(Tobit 4:9) 
For almsgiving delivers from death, and it is almsgiving that purifies sins and makes one find mercy and eternal life.

(Tobit 4:10) 
Those who give alms will receive fullness of life. But those who commit iniquity are enemies of their own soul, because their sins harm them.

(Tobit 4:11) 
Let every injurious word be avoided by you. And do not allow any excessive feasting—that is, gluttony. Nor should you entertain any breath of pride.

(Tobit 4:12) 
Never commit fornication, my son. Instead, take a wife from among your own kinsfolk, from the family of your parents. For if you take a foreign wife, you will be a participant in the sins of your fathers—that is, the sins of those who married outside the covenant.

(Tobit 4:13) 
For I remember, my son, that for this reason our brothers were killed: because they abandoned the commandment of the Lord when they married foreign women. So choose a wife from your own family. Do not become arrogant in your spirit and in your words, because from such arrogance comes all ruin and disgrace.

(Tobit 4:14) 
Whatever you would hate to have done to yourself, take care that you never do it to another person.

(Tobit 4:15) 
Share your bread with the hungry and the thirsty, and cover the naked with your own garments.

(Tobit 4:16) 
Every surplus that you have, give as alms. For every good work that you do will be blessed in the sight of the Most High God.

(Tobit 4:17) 
Beware, my son, of all fornication. And above all, marry a wife from the lineage of your parents. For the children of the proud are for destruction and not for glory.

(Tobit 4:18) 
For in the work of lies there is destruction and disgrace. But in the work of truth and glory, all who do it prosper.

(Tobit 4:19) 
Those who observe the commandments of God prosper. But those who fall away from Him will perish.

(Tobit 4:20) 
From all your fields, send something to the poor. And do not mock the poor, because in all things, almsgiving delivers us from death and makes us find grace with God.

(Tobit 4:21) 
And wherever you see a wise man, hurry to him, and let the threshold of your house be worn out by his footsteps—meaning, seek his counsel often.

(Tobit 4:22) 
Whatever counsel you may consider, take it from a wise person. And do not despise any useful counsel.

(Tobit 4:23) 
At all times, bless God and ask Him that your ways may be directed, and that all your counsels may remain in Him—that is, aligned with His will.

(Tobit 4:24) 
For all nations without God lack true counsel. But the Lord Himself will give them all counsel and all good things.

(Tobit 4:25) 
And He knows that they—the nations without God—have nothing to work for good. But the Lord our God Himself, who has given them all good things, will direct them in every work, so that they may do good in all things and always give glory to the Lord.

(Tobit 4:26) 
My son, just as I and your mother have lived in this life, so may you also live in your life.

(Tobit 4:27) 
Do not be afraid about earthly possessions, but let the fear of God be in your heart.

(Tobit 4:28) 
For if you do these things and observe His commandments, you will prosper at all times, and all the plans of your enemies will perish.

(Tobit 4:29) 
And do not be afraid, my dearest son, because we are indeed poor in earthly wealth, but we are rich in the Lord. And if we always fear the Lord and act with truth, we have abundant riches—riches that truly matter.

(Tobit 4:30) 
For just as the proud man fears for his riches, so the just man fears for his sins.

(Tobit 4:31) 
And do not fear from any evil, but in all things be faithful to the Lord.

(Tobit 4:32) 
For if you do these things, the memory of your father will not perish in you. For you are children of God, and just as your Father is God, so you are children of God forever and ever.

(Tobit 4:33) 
All the days of your life, my son, do not forget the commandments of the Lord. But in every work of yours, wherever you may be, always keep God in your heart. And do not desire to sin, nor to transgress His commandments.

(Tobit 4:34) 
At all times, bless God in every work of yours. And do not fear any evil, for just as the Lord is in the universe, so He is over the earth and all His creation, and all His creatures.

(Tobit 4:35) 
And because we are in Him, and all things are in Him, and all of us are in Him, and all peoples are in Him, and all creatures are in Him, and all good things are in Him.

(Tobit 4:36) 
For just as you are children of God, so also your brothers, the children of men, are children of God forever and ever. And the children of men are children of God forever and ever.

(Tobit 4:37) 
And therefore, my son, because in all things you have the fear of God and observe His commandments, it will always be well with you, and the memory of your father will not perish in you.

(Tobit 4:38) 
For just as I, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your relatives are children of God forever and ever, so you are a child of God forever and ever.

(Tobit 4:39) 
And do not fear about anything, but in all things be faithful to the Lord, because He Himself is your Father forever and ever, and your mother, and all your brothers, and all your relatives are children of God forever and ever.

(Tobit 4:40) 
And do not fear about anything, but in all things be faithful to the Lord. For He Himself is our Father forever and ever, and all His children, and all nations, and all His creatures, and all His creations, are children of God forever and ever.

(Tobit 4:1) 
So after these events, Tobias remembered the money he had entrusted to Gabael in Rages, a city in Media.

(Tobit 4:2) 
And he said to himself: "Look, I am about to die. Why should I not call my son Tobias so that I can tell him these things before I die?"

(Tobit 4:3) 
And calling his son Tobias, he said to him: "My son, listen to my words, and establish them in your heart as a firm foundation."

(Tobit 4:4) 
All the days of your life, keep God in your mind. Be careful not to sin intentionally, and never disregard the commandments of the Lord our God.

(Tobit 4:5) 
All the days of your life, give alms. Do not turn your face away from any poor person by withholding your substance, because if you turn your face away from any poor person, God will turn His face away from you.

(Tobit 4:6) 
Give alms according to what you possess. If you have much, give generously. If you have little, give even that little willingly.

(Tobit 4:7) 
You will gather a good spiritual treasure for yourself for the day of need.

(Tobit 4:8) 
Because almsgiving truly frees from the spiritual death of sin. It is what purifies sins and causes a person to find God's mercy and eternal life.

(Tobit 4:9) 
Those who give alms will not be in a state of great penance or sorrow for their sins.

(Tobit 4:10) 
Son, beware of all sexual immorality. And besides your own wife, never engage in any other sexual sin.

(Tobit 4:11) 
Never allow pride to dominate your mind, your words, or your actions, for from pride, all spiritual destruction took its beginning.

(Tobit 4:12) 
Whatever anyone does for you, pay him at once. And do not let the wages of your hired worker remain with you until the next day.

(Tobit 4:13) 
What you hate to receive, do not do to anyone else. Do not offer drink or food from your own stores, except to the truly needy.

(Tobit 4:14) 
And give alms from your substance, and ask God Himself that He may direct all your ways and that all your plans may endure in Him.

(Tobit 4:15) 
Do not fear, my son, our death at the same time, for even if we have nothing, you will still have resources.

(Tobit 4:16) 
My son, do not fear concerning our poverty. Indeed, you possess great riches if you fear God, and if you turn away from all sin, and if you do what is pleasing before Him.

(Tobit 4:17) 
And bless God at all times, and ask Him that He may direct your ways, and that all your plans may endure in Him.

(Tobit 4:18) 
And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.

(Tobit 4:19) 
Bury your father and your mother. And from those things that remain to you for your sustenance, give alms.

(Tobit 4:20) 
And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.

(Tobit 4:21) 
And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.

(Tobit 5:1) 
Tobias answered his father, saying, "Father, I will do everything you have commanded me."

(Tobit 5:2) 
"But how will I get that money back from Gabael when he doesn't even know about it? And I don't know the man who was entrusted with it. How can I go to him if I don't know the way?"

(Tobit 5:3) 
Then his father answered, saying, "I have his receipt here with me. When you show him that, he will immediately return the money to you. Now go and find some trustworthy man who will go with you. He will be paid when you both return."

(Tobit 5:4) 
Tobias went out and found a splendid young man standing there, dressed and ready, as if prepared for a journey.

(Tobit 5:5) 
Tobias did not know that this young man was an angel of God. So he greeted him and asked, "Where are you from, good young man?"

(Tobit 5:6) 
The young man answered, "I am one of the children of Israel." Tobias then asked him, "Do you know the way that leads to the region of Media?"

(Tobit 5:7) 
The young man answered, "I know the way very well. I am learned in all its roads. I have often traveled to Media and stayed with our countryman Gabael, who lives in Rages of Media. It's a two-day journey from Ecbatana to Rages."

(Tobit 5:8) 
Tobias said to him, "Please wait for me while I tell my father this news."

(Tobit 5:9) 
Tobias went inside and told his father everything. Then his father called the young man in and said to him, "My countryman, what would you like to be paid for the journey if you go with my son?"

(Tobit 5:10) 
The young man said, "Besides the provision of food for you and your son, you will give me two drachmas a day and whatever else is necessary for expenses. When we return, I will receive the rest of my pay as is fair."

(Tobit 5:11) 
Tobit then said to him, "Go and journey with my son, and I will add more to what you have asked for."

(Tobit 5:12) 
When Tobit heard this agreement, he said to the young man, "Lead my son safely and bring him back to me sound and unharmed. And may an angel of the Lord be with you on your journey."

(Tobit 5:13) 
His mother Anna then said to Tobit, "Why was it necessary for you to send our son away? Is he not the support of our old age? He is the one who helps us in and out of the house."

(Tobit 5:14) 
"Do not be so eager to pile up more money! Let that money be like dirt compared to our son's safety!"

(Tobit 5:15) 
"Our poverty is enough for us. We would be rich enough if only we could see our son safe and sound."

(Tobit 5:16) 
And Tobit said to her, "Do not be troubled, my mother. This journey will be a safe one for our son, and he will return here to you again, and you will see him."

(Tobit 5:17) 
His mother spoke to him like this, and after that, she was silent.

(Tobit 5:18) 
So Tobias went out on his journey with his dog, and they came to a place where there was water.

(Tobit 5:19) 
A large fish suddenly rushed out of the water and tried to swallow him.

(Tobit 5:20) 
Tobias cried out and said, "Lord, it will carry me off!"

(Tobit 5:21) 
The angel said to him, "Grab the fish and pull it towards you!" When Tobias did this, he dragged the fish onto the dry land, and it thrashed about outside the water.

(Tobit 5:22) 
And the angel said to him, "Open the fish and take out its heart, gall, and liver. Keep these for yourself. Discard the rest of the fish's internal organs by throwing them onto the ground."

(Tobit 5:1) 
Then Tobias answered his father and said, "Father, I will do everything you have commanded me."

(Tobit 5:2) 
"But how can I collect the money you left with Gabael? He doesn't know me, and I don't have anything that proves I'm you, like a written sign or a seal."

(Tobit 5:3) 
Then his father answered him, "I have the signed document for it right here with me. When you show it to him, he will immediately give the money back."

(Tobit 5:4) 
"But now, my son, find a faithful man who will go with you, so he can also receive his payment when he returns."

(Tobit 5:5) 
Tobias went out and found a splendid young man standing there, dressed and ready, as if prepared to travel.

(Tobit 5:6) 
Not knowing that he was an angel of God, Tobias greeted him and said, "Good young man, where are you from?"

(Tobit 5:7) 
The young man answered, "I am from the sons of Israel." And Tobias asked him, "Do you know the way that leads to the region of Media?"

(Tobit 5:8) 
He replied, "I know it, and I have traveled all its roads. I even stayed with our brother Gabael, who lives in Rages, a city in Media."

(Tobit 5:9) 
Tobias then said to him, "Please wait for me while I tell these things to my father."

(Tobit 5:10) 
So Tobias went in and announced to his father, saying, "Look, I have found a young man from the sons of Israel who is willing to come with me."

(Tobit 5:11) 
His father replied, "Call him to me so I can learn what tribe he belongs to, and whether he is a faithful man to travel with you."

(Tobit 5:12) 
Tobias went out and called him, saying, "Young man, my father wants to see you."

(Tobit 5:13) 
When he came in, he greeted Tobias's father. And Tobias the elder said, "Brother, where are you from? And from what tribe and what family?"

(Tobit 5:14) 
He answered him, "I am from the sons of Israel, and from the tribe of Naphtali."

(Tobit 5:15) 
And Tobias the elder said to him, "Does your tribe happen to have anyone I know?"

(Tobit 5:16) 
He replied, "One kinsman, Ananias, from my ancestors."

(Tobit 5:17) 
And Tobias the elder said to him, "Are you perhaps the son of Ananias, my elder kinsman?"

(Tobit 5:18) 
He said to him, "I am not." And Tobias the elder said, "I know you are from a great family, brother. But tell me, what will your payment be? And I will give it to you."

(Tobit 5:19) 
The angel answered, "If you go with me and make the journey, perhaps your payment should be greater than you are thinking."

(Tobit 5:20) 
But Tobias the elder said to him, "I will give you ten drachmas a day, and your food will be with me, as if you were one of my own sons."

(Tobit 5:21) 
If, however, you return safely with me, beyond the payment I mentioned, I will give you more, as if you were my own brother.

(Tobit 5:22) 
The angel answered him, "I will go with you, and do not be afraid. We will have a safe journey and will return to you again."

(Tobit 5:23) 
And Tobias the elder, responding, said, "I will bless you, brother, on this journey and throughout all the days of your life."

(Tobit 5:24) 
As Tobias was leaving his house, and his wife feared for him, his son reminded him, while on the way, to take the money that was owed to him from them.

(Tobit 5:25) 
And Tobias the elder said, "I will do it, but I will not go without that young man, whom you do not know."

(Tobit 5:26) 
But when she heard that he was going, she began to weep, saying, "You have sent my son, the light of my eyes, into the hands of a stranger!"

(Tobit 5:27) 
"Even if you wanted to give me gold and much money, I could not be without my son."

(Tobit 5:28) 
"Was it not enough for you that we are poor, and that for our comfort, we have a son?"

(Tobit 5:29) 
"Do not add sorrow to sorrow. For what we have is nothing compared to him."

(Tobit 5:30) 
Tobias the elder said, "You must not be troubled, sister. For the young man himself is faithful, and he will come back safely, and he will keep the money well."

(Tobit 5:31) 
"And he will return to us quickly."

(Tobit 5:32) 
"And this does not concern you, but me. Do not be afraid, sister."

(Tobit 5:33) 
"Because my boy will have a faithful angel with him, and he will have a safe journey, and he will return to us."

(Tobit 5:34) 
And so she stopped weeping.

(Tobit 5:35) 
And Tobias went out with the young man, and his dog followed them.

(Tobit 5:36) 
And he continued his journey.

(Tobit 5:37) 
And when he came to the river Tigris, he stopped on its bank and washed his feet.

(Tobit 5:38) 
And as he stood there, suddenly a large fish lunged at him and tried to swallow him.

(Tobit 5:39) 
And the angel said to him, "Catch the fish, and hold it fast."

(Tobit 5:40) 
And he caught the fish and dragged it onto the dry ground.

(Tobit 6:1) 
As they traveled, they arrived at the Tigris river in the evening, and there they made their camp for the night.

(Tobit 6:2) 
And when the young man went down to bathe, suddenly, a huge fish came out of the water to swallow him.

(Tobit 6:3) 
Tobias was terrified by it, and he cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Sir, look! A fish is attacking me!"

(Tobit 6:4) 
And the angel said to him, "Grab the fish, and hold on to it!" So the young man seized the fish and dragged it onto the dry land.

(Tobit 6:5) 
And the angel told him, "Gut the fish, and keep its heart, gall, and liver for yourself, because these will be necessary for a very useful medicine."

(Tobit 6:6) 
And so the young man did exactly as the angel had commanded him. He prepared the fish, extracted the useful parts, and then cooked and ate the rest of it.

(Tobit 6:7) 
And as they continued their journey, they spoke together, and then they approached the region of Media.

(Tobit 6:8) 
And Tobias asked the angel, saying, "Brother Azarias, I beg you, what kind of medicine is found in the heart, gall, and liver of this fish?"

(Tobit 6:9) 
And he answered him, "If a demon or an evil spirit is troubling someone, the heart of the fish must be burned as incense, and all torment will cease, and the evil spirit will depart from that person forever."

(Tobit 6:10) 
And as for the gall, a person who has white spots in their eyes should be anointed with it, and they will be cured.

(Tobit 6:11) 
Then Tobias asked, "Where do you want us to stay?" And the angel replied, "There is a man here who is your kinsman, named Raguel, from the tribe of Rachel. He has a daughter named Sarah, and she is his only child. All of his inheritance would belong to you, because he has no other children except for his one daughter, Sarah."

(Tobit 6:12) 
You should ask for her to be your wife, and the Lord will surely give her to you.

(Tobit 6:13) 
And Tobias said, "I have heard, brother Azarias, that seven men married her, and they all died. But I also heard that a demon was the one who killed them."

(Tobit 6:14) 
And now I am afraid that this might happen to me as well. Since I am the only child of my parents, I would bring their old age down to the grave with great sorrow.

(Tobit 6:15) 
And the angel Raphael said to him, "Listen to me, and I will show you by what instruction a demon is overcome. For whoever takes a wife and rejects God, abandoning his own reason, and gives himself over to lust like a horse or a mule which has no understanding, a demon has power over such people."

(Tobit 6:16) 
But you, when you marry her, go into your wedding chamber, and for three days, refrain from marital intimacy with her. During that time, devote yourselves to nothing else but prayers, together with her.

(Tobit 6:17) 
But on that first night, you shall throw the fish's liver into the fire, and the demon will flee.

(Tobit 6:18) 
And on the second night, there will be a blessing for your marriage.

(Tobit 6:19) 
And on the third night, you will receive a blessing, so that children may be born to you both.

(Tobit 6:20) 
But after the third night, you shall take the virgin as your wife with a profound reverence for the Lord, choosing this holy union over merely satisfying lust. And in the lineage of Abraham, you shall be blessed with children.

(Tobit 6:21) 
And the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, brother, because she is destined to be your wife. Heed my words, and everything will turn out well for you."

(Tobit 6:22) 
And Tobias said, "I will do exactly as you have told me."

(Tobit 7:1) 
When Tobiah entered into the city of Rages, he came to the house of Raguel.

(Tobit 7:2) 
Raguel welcomed him joyfully. He looked at Tobiah and said to his wife, Anna, "How much this young man resembles my relative, Tobias!"

(Tobit 7:3) 
And after these words, Raguel swore an oath and said: "Are you not the son of my brother Tobias?"

(Tobit 7:4) 
And Tobiah replied to him, "I am his son."

(Tobit 7:5) 
Both men then stood up, embraced each other, and wept. Raguel wept with tears, saying, "May blessings be upon you, my son, for you are the son of a good and most excellent man."

(Tobit 7:6) 
Raguel exclaimed, "Oh, what sorrow! Why did I not die sooner so that I could have seen you before now?" Raguel was struck with such grief that even his daughter Sarah wept.

(Tobit 7:7) 
Raguel welcomed him with great hospitality; he slaughtered a ram from his flocks and received them with joy, celebrating their arrival.

(Tobit 7:8) 
After Tobiah had washed and purified himself, he came in to join the feast.

(Tobit 7:9) 
Then Tobiah said to Raphael, who was disguised as Azariah, "Brother Azariah, tell Raguel to give me his daughter Sarah to be my wife."

(Tobit 7:10) 
Raguel heard this request and said to Tobiah, "Eat, drink, and be cheerful tonight. Indeed, there is no other man who has the right to take my daughter Sarah as his wife except you, my relative, because you are closely related to me by blood."

(Tobit 7:11) 
Raguel then continued, "But I want to tell you the truth, my son: I have given my daughter to seven husbands, and all of them died on the very night they went in to be with her. Yet, despite this, be cheerful tonight."

(Tobit 7:12) 
But Tobiah declared, "I will not eat or drink from this feast until you make a firm arrangement regarding what concerns me and your daughter."

(Tobit 7:13) 
Raguel replied, "I will do it!" And he granted Tobiah the legal right to have Sarah as his wife, and he drew up the marriage contract. Only then did they begin to eat and drink together.

(Tobit 7:14) 
Raguel then called his wife Anna and instructed her, "Prepare another chamber, and lead Sarah into it."

(Tobit 7:15) 
Anna led Sarah into her bridal chamber, and Sarah began to weep.

(Tobit 7:16) 
And Anna comforted her daughter, assuring her that she would be safe. Anna said to her, "Have confidence, my daughter; the Lord will grant you joy in place of this sorrow you now feel."

(Tobit 7:17) 
After Sarah had purified herself and prayed, she sat down at the table. Raguel then began to eat and drink.

(Tobit 7:1) 
Tobias entered Rages, a city belonging to the Medes, and Azarias—who was Raphael the Archangel in disguise—was with him.

(Tobit 7:2) 
When they arrived at Ecbatana, they went to Raguel’s house. Raguel welcomed them with great joy.

(Tobit 7:3) 
Raguel looked at Tobias and said to his wife, Anna, 'This young man looks so much like my cousin Tobit!'

(Tobit 7:4) 
After much conversation, Raguel asked them, 'Where are you from, my brothers?' They answered him, 'We are descendants of Naphtali, from the people taken captive to Nineveh.'

(Tobit 7:5) 
Raguel then asked them, 'Do you know our kinsman Tobit?' And they replied, 'We do know him.'

(Tobit 7:6) 
While they spoke many good things about Tobit, the angel Raphael then said to Raguel, 'This Tobias, about whom you are asking, is the son of your kinsman Tobit.'

(Tobit 7:7) 
Raguel immediately sprang forward, kissed Tobias, and began to weep. Throwing his arms around Tobias’s neck, he continued to weep over him.

(Tobit 7:8) 
And Raguel said to him, 'May you be blessed, my son, for you are the son of a good and most excellent man.'

(Tobit 7:9) 
Then his wife Anna and his daughter Sara also began to weep.

(Tobit 7:10) 
After these words, Raguel ordered a ram from his flocks to be slaughtered and a feast to be prepared.

(Tobit 7:11) 
Knowing that Sara, Raguel’s daughter, was rightly due to him as a wife according to the Law of Moses, the angel spoke to Raguel on Tobias's behalf, saying, 'I will not eat or drink here today unless you first promise to give me your daughter Sara as my wife.'

(Tobit 7:12) 
When he heard this, Raguel could not refuse him, knowing that she was to be given to him according to the Law of Moses.

(Tobit 7:13) 
So Raguel took the hand of his daughter Sara and gave her to Tobias as his wife. And he said, 'Behold, my daughter is betrothed to you today, my son; from this day forth and into the future, she shall be your wife. Take her into your home in peace.'

(Tobit 7:14) 
Then he called Sara’s mother, Anna, and told her to bring a legal document so that he might write down the marriage contract for her forever, including her dowry.

(Tobit 7:15) 
Afterward, they began the wedding feast. Raguel blessed them and then presented his daughter Sara.

(Tobit 7:16) 
And Raguel said: 'I bless you, my daughter, and may God bless you—He who made the universe and the earth, and the sea, and the mountains, and the rivers, and all things that are in them. Above all things, may the Lord bless you.'

(Tobit 7:17) 
And above all, may the Lord bless you and make you worthy to bear sons and grandsons for yourself.

(Tobit 7:18) 
Then Raguel called Tobias and said to him: 'Take courage, brother, and eat and drink, and be cheerful! For it is fitting for you alone to take my daughter as your wife, and therefore, no other man can take her as a husband but you.'

(Tobit 8:1) 
When the dinner party was finished, they brought Tobias to Sara.

(Tobit 8:2) 
“Remember, sister,” Tobias said to her, “that we should pray to God before we approach each other, and let us ask the Lord for our health and protection.”

(Tobit 8:3) 
Sara replied to him, “You are right, brother, that we should pray and ask the Lord for health, protection, and mercy.”

(Tobit 8:4) 
They both went into the room and prayed earnestly together, that their health might be preserved.

(Tobit 8:5) 
And Tobias said, “Blessed are You, God of our fathers, and blessed is Your holy and glorious name forever and ever. May the skies and all Your creation bless You.”

(Tobit 8:6) 
“You made Adam, and gave him Eve as a helper and a support, and from them the human race came forth. You said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone; let us make him a helper like himself.’”

(Tobit 8:7) 
“And now, O Lord, You know that I do not approach this my sister out of lust, but with the sole intention of begetting children, through whom Your name may be blessed forever and ever.”

(Tobit 8:8) 
Sara also said, “Blessed are You, my God, and blessed is Your name forever; and may all Your creatures bless You.”

(Tobit 8:9) 
And God heard the prayer of both of them, and He sent His angel Raphael to heal them.

(Tobit 8:10) 
Raphael went forth and seized the demon, and bound him in the upper desert of Egypt.

(Tobit 8:11) 
Raphael returned and said to Tobias, “Do not fear, Tobias, for God has blessed you.” Then Tobias and Sara came together as husband and wife.

(Tobit 8:12) 
And on that very night, the demon departed from her and did not harm her.

(Tobit 8:13) 
And Tobias remembered the Lord's command concerning chastity and prayer, and he did what had been told to him.

(Tobit 8:14) 
And it happened after three days that Tobias and Sara rose up and saw each other, and they were no longer afraid.

(Tobit 8:15) 
And Tobias said, “Sister, because of you, the Lord preserved our lives and delivered us from the power of the demon, and our life has now become good.”

(Tobit 8:16) 
“Therefore, praise the Lord, and let us celebrate His name, who made us safe.”

(Tobit 8:17) 
And it happened after these words that Tobias and Sara rose up, and they joyfully embraced each other and blessed the Lord.

(Tobit 8:18) 
And Tobias said, “Blessed are You, O Lord our God, who blesses us in all things and saves our souls from hell.”

(Tobit 8:19) 
“Blessed are You, who does great wonders and delivers us from death.”

(Tobit 8:20) 
“Blessed are You, who created all things and governs all things.”

(Tobit 8:21) 
“Blessed are You, who are in the sky and on the earth, and in all Your creatures.”

(Tobit 8:1) 
When the wedding feast was finished, they led Sara to young Tobiah.

(Tobit 8:2) 
And Tobiah, remembering the angel’s words, took a portion of the fish’s liver from his satchel and placed it upon burning coals.

(Tobit 8:3) 
Then the Archangel Raphael seized the demon and bound him in the desert lands of Upper Egypt.

(Tobit 8:4) 
But Tobiah, rising from the bed, said to her, 'Rise, Sara, and let us pray to God today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. For these first three nights, we are dedicating ourselves to the Lord. After the third night has passed, we shall consummate our marriage fully.'

(Tobit 8:5) 
For we are the children of saints, and it is not fitting for us to unite ourselves as those pagans do, who do not know God.

(Tobit 8:6) 
And both of them rose, and they prayed together earnestly that they might be kept safe and unharmed.

(Tobit 8:7) 
And he prayed, saying, 'I bless You, O God of our fathers, and I bless Your holy and glorious Name unto ages of ages. May all creation, both the heavens and all Your creatures, bless You.'

(Tobit 8:8) 
And now, O Lord, You know that it is not out of lust that I have taken this kinswoman of mine, but solely for the sake of begetting children. May Your Name be blessed through her unto ages of ages.

(Tobit 8:9) 
And Sara also prayed, saying, 'Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and grant that we may dwell together into old age.'

(Tobit 8:10) 
And when dawn broke, Raguel commanded his servants to dig a grave and bury Tobiah, lest the same fate that befell the seven previous husbands should also befall him.

(Tobit 8:11) 
So they dug and prepared a grave for him.

(Tobit 8:12) 
But Raguel, the father-in-law, returned to his wife Edna and said to her, 'Send one of your servant-girls to see if he is dead, so that we may bury him before anyone finds out and shames us.'

(Tobit 8:13) 
So she sent one of her servant-girls, who, upon entering the chamber, found them safe and sound, sleeping together in the same bed.

(Tobit 8:14) 
And returning, she announced the joyful news to them. And each person blessed the God of the Jews for having preserved Tobiah.

(Tobit 8:15) 
And Raguel praised the Lord and said, 'Blessed are You, O Lord God, with every pure blessing, so that Your holy Name may be blessed in all ages.'

(Tobit 8:16) 
May the heavens praise You, and all Your creation, and Your two holy angels.

(Tobit 8:17) 
May all bless You in all ages, because You have made me joyful and have not brought me sorrow.

(Tobit 8:18) 
And I bless You because You have shown Your mercy upon my two dear and unique children.

(Tobit 8:19) 
Grant, O Lord, that they may reach old age together without complaint.

(Tobit 8:20) 
And may they serve You all the days of their lives, and bless You at all times.

(Tobit 8:21) 
And then Raguel commanded a great wedding feast to be held, and they celebrated and feasted for seven days.

(Tobit 9:1) 
Then Tobias called the angel, who had been traveling as Azariah, to him. Tobias said, 'My brother Azariah, I ask you to take servants and camels with you. Go to Rages, the city in Media, to Gabael, and give him back his bond—the record of the money we lent him—and receive the money from him.'

(Tobit 9:2) 
And bring Gabael back with you to my wedding. For I know that my father is keeping track of the days I have been away, and if I delay even one more day, he will be very sorrowful.

(Tobit 9:3) 
So Raphael, revealing his true identity through his actions, took the servants and camels. He set out for Rages, the city in Media, to Gabael, and returned his bond, receiving all the money from him.

(Tobit 9:4) 
Raphael then brought Gabael with him to the wedding celebration. Gabael blessed Tobias, the young man, and his wife Sarah, and Tobias's mother.

(Tobit 9:5) 
After the seven days of wedding festivities were completed, Raphael and Gabael returned to Tobias and Sarah.

(Tobit 9:1) 
Then Tobias called the Angel, whom he thought was a man, to himself and said to him: "Brother Azarias, I ask you to take servants and camels with you, and go to Rages, a city of the Medes, to Gabael. Give him my bond for the money and collect it. Then, bring him back here for my wedding."

(Tobit 9:2) 
You know that my father is counting the days, and if I am late even by a single day, he will be very sad.

(Tobit 9:3) 
And Raphael took four of Tobias's servants and two camels with him. He traveled to Rages, the city of the Medes, and found Gabael. He gave him Tobias's bond and received all the money from him.

(Tobit 9:4) 
Raphael also informed Gabael about everything that had happened to young Tobias. Then, he brought Gabael back with him for the wedding.

(Tobit 9:5) 
And Gabael came to the wedding of Tobias, blessing the Lord, because God had shown great favor to Tobias.

(Tobit 9:6) 
Now, all these things happened after seven days, and everyone celebrated the wedding with great reverence for God.

(Tobit 10:1) 
Meanwhile, Tobias was on his journey back home. Anna, his mother, sat every day by the road from which her son had departed, waiting for him.

(Tobit 10:2) 
With an attentive face, she would look around, hoping he might appear; and when she saw no one, she would resume her lament, uttering this cry:

(Tobit 10:3) 
“Oh, my son! Why did we send you out, you who are the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the comfort of our life, the hope of our future generations?”

(Tobit 10:4) 
Our worry for you makes our every step feel empty and useless.

(Tobit 10:5) 
“If only we had not sent you! And if only we ourselves had died, so that we would not have to see all this sorrow we now endure.”

(Tobit 10:6) 
And Tobit, his father, kept telling her: “Calm down, and do not be troubled, my sister. Our son is healthy; the news is good. Our kinsman who was with him on the journey is safe. They will all come home well.”

(Tobit 10:7) 
But Anna did not cease her tears, but instead, she continually kept watching the road from which her son had departed.

(Tobit 10:8) 
And behold, one certain day, seeing the dog coming, she stood up and exclaimed:

(Tobit 10:9) 
“My son is coming!” And immediately going out to meet her son, she ran to him, and embraced him, and kept kissing him, saying:

(Tobit 10:10) 
“Thank you, God, because you have returned him to me!” And immediately, his mother and his father, and all their friends, went out to meet him.

(Tobit 10:11) 
And upon entering the house, and placing Tobias on the bed, his father said to him: “Now, my son, get ready to prepare yourself for healing.”

(Tobit 10:12) 
And Tobias said: “From the very start, by the power of God, God has blessed me in every way; for behold, I have come, and now, God, heal me.”

(Tobit 10:13) 
And his father embraced Tobias, and said to him: “Blessed are you, my son, at all times!”

(Tobit 10:14) 
And Anna, his mother, said: “Since in my life I have not seen you in prosperity until now; may Almighty God now bless you!”

(Tobit 10:1) 
While these things were happening in Ecbatana, Tobias’s father, Tobit, was anxious every day. He counted the nights and days of the time he had agreed upon for his son's return, and when that day was completed, and his son had not yet arrived,

(Tobit 10:2) 
he kept saying: 'Is Tobias perhaps delayed? Or has Raguel kept him with him? Or perhaps Tobias has died? Or surely, he is being held back.'

(Tobit 10:3) 
And thus he was afflicted, and began to gravely despair, saying:

(Tobit 10:4) 
'Woe is me, my son! If only I had not sent you! The light of my eyes, which went with you, has been taken away from me.'

(Tobit 10:5) 
His mother, Anna, also sat daily by the roadside where her son had departed, looking into the distance, hoping he might come:

(Tobit 10:6) 
and when she saw the road deserted, she began to cry, and say:

(Tobit 10:7) 
'Woe is me, my son! Why did we send you, the very light of our eyes? You are the support for our old age, the hope of our life, our very guidance. For when you were with us, we had everything, but since you have gone from us, we are now in poverty.'

(Tobit 10:8) 
Moreover, Raphael said to Tobias: 'Do you not know, brother, how you left your father?'

(Tobit 10:9) 
Did he not admonish you to honor your father and your mother?

(Tobit 10:10) 
And now, if it pleases you, return to your father as quickly as you can. I will go ahead of you, and you will then be able to take care of him, your wife Sarah, your maidservants, and your livestock.

(Tobit 10:11) 
And Tobias, though he was sad because he would be leaving his wife in this manner, nevertheless agreed with the angel to do so.

(Tobit 10:12) 
And Tobias said to his wife: 'Sarah, get up, and I will go to my father; for I know that my father and my mother are anxious in their hearts.'

(Tobit 10:13) 
And rising up, the woman, and the son, and the maidservants, and all the livestock they possessed, they departed from Ecbatana, and went on their way to his father’s house in Nineveh.

(Tobit 11:1) 
When they reached Caserin, which is located across from Nineveh, Raphael said to Tobias, "Brother, you know how you left your father behind, don't you?"

(Tobit 11:2) 
"If it pleases you, let us hurry on ahead of the horses and the rest of your family, so your mother, your wife, and the animals can follow."

(Tobit 11:3) 
As they continued on their journey, Raphael said to Tobias, "Take some of the fish's gall with you, because you will certainly need it."

(Tobit 11:4) 
So Tobias went on ahead, and his dog followed close behind him.

(Tobit 11:5) 
Meanwhile, Anna, Tobias's mother, was sitting by the roadside on a lookout point, from which she could see far into the distance.

(Tobit 11:6) 
As she gazed out, she saw his arrival from afar and immediately recognized her son coming towards her. Running quickly, she announced to her husband, "Look, your son is coming!"

(Tobit 11:7) 
And Tobit, his father, leaped from his bed, stumbling with his feet, and went out onto the road, running to meet his son.

(Tobit 11:8) 
When Tobit reached him, he embraced Tobias, as did Sarah, Tobias's wife, and Anna, his mother. Everyone was filled with joy because he had returned healthy and safe.

(Tobit 11:9) 
Holding his son's hand, Tobit came and applied some of the fish's gall, which Tobias had brought from the small fish, onto his father's eyes.

(Tobit 11:10) 
After approximately thirty days, Tobit opened his eyes and was able to see his son again.

(Tobit 11:11) 
Falling upon his son's neck, Tobit wept and exclaimed, "I see you, my son, you are the light of my eyes!"

(Tobit 11:12) 
His wife, Anna, also said, "Now that I see you, my son, I am content to die."

(Tobit 11:13) 
Their house was filled with great joy, and they all blessed God for His mercy.

(Tobit 11:14) 
A great feast was prepared, and the celebration lasted for seven days, during which they continued to bless the Lord.

(Tobit 11:15) 
Then Tobit called Raphael and said to him, "Brother, command me, and I will give you half of everything we have brought back."

(Tobit 11:16) 
Raphael replied to him, "Do not be troubled by this, for I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who stand before God Himself."

(Tobit 11:17) 
Tobit said to him, "What is it you have just revealed?"

(Tobit 11:18) 
Raphael answered, "It is not for me to conceal this truth from you. For I know that all of God's blessings are truly in you."

(Tobit 11:19) 
As they all entered the house, they blessed the Lord. A great feast was made, and Tobit rejoiced greatly.

(Tobit 11:1) 
And Tobias left, and his dog was with him, and Raphael followed them.

(Tobit 11:2) 
And while they were still traveling, Raphael said to Tobias: "We know that your father will regain the light of his eyes."

(Tobit 11:3) 
"But you must do it this way: When you enter your house, immediately worship the Lord your God, and give Him thanks. Then approach your father and kiss him."

(Tobit 11:4) 
"And immediately rub the fish's gall on his eyes, the one you brought with you. And we know that his eyes will open at once, and your father, in your joy, will see the light of the sky."

(Tobit 11:5) 
Then the dog, who had been with them on the journey, ran ahead and overtook them with the news, and in his joy, he fawned over them, wagging his tail.

(Tobit 11:6) 
And his blind father, Tobit, got up and began to walk, stumbling with his feet. And while he was still walking, his father-in-law took hold of him.

(Tobit 11:7) 
And he led him in, and kissed him with tears. And his wife Anna and his daughter also kissed him. And all of them began to weep together, and to rejoice because he had come to them.

(Tobit 11:8) 
And after they had worshipped the Lord and given Him thanks, Tobias applied the fish's gall to his father's eyes.

(Tobit 11:9) 
And he waited for about half an hour, and a white film began to come out of his eyes.

(Tobit 11:10) 
And Tobias took hold of the film with his hand and pulled it out of his eyes, and immediately he regained his sight.

(Tobit 11:11) 
And Tobit himself, and his wife, and all who knew him, magnified God and said: "Blessed are You, our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave, and makes the dead live."

(Tobit 11:12) 
"And now we know that Your mercy is upon Israel forever."

(Tobit 11:13) 
And Tobit said: "Behold, I see my son, and my daughter, and your wife, and her children, and we recognize you in your joy, because the Lord has delivered you."

(Tobit 11:14) 
And suddenly getting up, he went out to the gate and met his son.

(Tobit 11:15) 
And he embraced him, and kissed him with tears. And he said: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave."

(Tobit 11:16) 
"And now I see my son Tobias, and his wife, and their children."

(Tobit 11:17) 
And they all entered the house together. And behold, Anna his wife came to meet him, and his daughter, and all his servants, and his handmaids.

(Tobit 11:18) 
And as they narrated all that had happened to them, Tobit learned that the Lord had delivered his wife from danger, and his daughter.

(Tobit 11:19) 
And all of them together magnified God and said: "Blessed are You, our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave, and makes the dead live."

(Tobit 12:1) 
After these events, Tobias called the angel who was with him, who he still thought was merely a man, and said to him: “Brother Azariah, what can I give you? Or what worthy reward can I find for all the things you have done for me?”

(Tobit 12:2) 
You were my guide, and showed me the way on my journey; you helped me in danger; you found my wife Sarah for me; you recovered the money from Gabael; and finally, you healed my father. What could I possibly give you for all of these things?

(Tobit 12:3) 
The angel answered them and said: “I know that all of your words are true, and that you confess all of these things from your heart.”

(Tobit 12:4) 
“Therefore, now it is time for me to reveal myself to you and to hide nothing.”

(Tobit 12:5) 
“For when you went with your father, and buried the dead—likewise, when you washed yourself, and ate, and then left your meal, and went into the grave of the dead man without clothes, and buried him—I was sent on a mission to test you.”

(Tobit 12:6) 
“And again, when you and Sarah prayed, I offered your prayer before the glory of the Lord.”

(Tobit 12:7) 
“And because you were acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation would prove your worth.”

(Tobit 12:8) 
“And now the Lord has sent me on this mission so that I might heal you and free Sarah, your wife, from the demon.”

(Tobit 12:9) 
“For I am Raphael, the angel, one of the seven who stand before the Lord.”

(Tobit 12:10) 
Then both of them were greatly disturbed, and they fell on their faces, and were exceedingly afraid.

(Tobit 12:11) 
And the angel said to them: “Do not be afraid; peace be with you. For all the good things you have done, bless the Lord, and sing praises to Him.”

(Tobit 12:12) 
“For I did not come by my own power or grace, but by the will of our God. Therefore, bless Him forever.”

(Tobit 12:13) 
“Throughout all my days, I appeared to you. And I ate and drank with you, and as you were taking food and drink, I was present to you, but I did not eat flesh; rather, I sustained myself by spiritual vision.”

(Tobit 12:14) 
“Now, therefore, it is time for me to return to Him who sent me on this mission. As for you, bless God and tell of all His wonderful deeds.”

(Tobit 12:15) 
And when he had said these things, he was taken away from their sight, and they saw him no more.

(Tobit 12:16) 
Then, prostrating themselves on the ground, they blessed God, and rising up, they recounted all His wonderful deeds, how the angel of God had appeared to them.

(Tobit 12:17) 
And Tobias said to his father: “How much should we give him? Or what worthy honor can we bestow upon him?”

(Tobit 12:18) 
“For if we were to give him half of all the things we brought back, it would not be nearly enough for his worth.”

(Tobit 12:19) 
“For he brought my wife back to me safely, and recovered the money from Gabael, and healed you, and delivered me from all dangers.”

(Tobit 12:20) 
Therefore, considering all these things, he called out to him and said to him: “Brother Azariah, take half of all the things that have been brought, and go with all good things and peace, and may the blessing of the Lord be with you.”

(Tobit 12:21) 
And the evening and morning passed—the fifth day. —This appears to be an error in the Clementine Vulgate, copied from Genesis 1.

(Tobit 12:22) 
So Tobias called him and said to him: “Brother Azariah, take half of all the things that have been brought, and go with all good things and peace, and may the blessing of the Lord be with you.”

(Tobit 13:1) 
Then Tobias began to pray, saying this: 'Blessed are You, Lord, God of Israel, and blessed is Your name for all ages to come, forever and ever.'

(Tobit 13:2) 
'For You punish, and You save; You bring down to the realm of the dead, and You bring back up from it; and no one can escape Your powerful hand.'

(Tobit 13:3) 
'Acknowledge Him, O children of Israel, and praise Him in the sight of the non-Jewish nations.'

(Tobit 13:4) 
'For this reason, He scattered you among the nations that do not know Him, so that you might proclaim His marvelous deeds, and make them understand that there is no other Almighty God besides Him.'

(Tobit 13:5) 
'He certainly punished us because of our sins; and He Himself will save us because of His mercy.'

(Tobit 13:6) 
'Therefore, see what He has done with us, and with fear and trembling, give Him thanks. Exalt the King of all ages in your every action.'

(Tobit 13:7) 
'I, in the land where I am held captive, give Him thanks; because He has shown His majesty among a sinful people.'

(Tobit 13:8) 
'Therefore, turn back, you sinners, and do what is right before Him, believing that He will show you His mercy.'

(Tobit 13:9) 
'I, and my very soul, rejoice in Him.'

(Tobit 13:10) 
'Bless Him, all His chosen ones, on days of joy, and give Him thanks.'

(Tobit 13:11) 
'O Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord will rebuild you forever. Therefore, rejoice in your restored state and your good deeds.'

(Tobit 13:12) 
'The righteous will give thanks to you, and they will bless your holy name.'

(Tobit 13:13) 
'Blessed will be those who were afflicted within you, in all things; blessed are those who will boast in you above all others, and will boast about the punishments you endured.'

(Tobit 13:14) 
'He will lift up their souls, and they will rejoice in His salvation.'

(Tobit 13:15) 
'Blessed be the Lord in all His works, and blessed forever: So that He may rebuild your temple with joy.'

(Tobit 13:16) 
'And in you may there be joy throughout all ages; and let all the righteous exult in you, from one age to the next.'

(Tobit 13:17) 
'Giving praise to Your name for ever and ever; because they will be chosen in all their works.'

(Tobit 13:18) 
'And blessed are You, great King, because in You Jerusalem, Your city, will be rebuilt in all its works, just as Isaiah spoke concerning you.'

(Tobit 13:1) 
And Tobias began to praise the Lord by saying:

(Tobit 13:2) 
"Blessed is the Lord, who lives forever, through all ages.

(Tobit 13:3) 
And His Kingdom extends over all things.

(Tobit 13:4) 
For He disciplines His people and then shows mercy. He brings souls down to the abode of the dead and then brings them back to life.

(Tobit 13:5) 
And there is no one who can escape His hand and power.

(Tobit 13:6) 
O children of Israel, give thanks to Him, and praise Him in the sight of all the nations.

(Tobit 13:7) 
For this reason, He has scattered you among the nations who do not know Him: so that you may declare His wondrous works, and make them know that there is no other God except Him.

(Tobit 13:8) 
He Himself disciplined us because of our sins, and He Himself will save us because of His mercy.

(Tobit 13:9) 
Give thanks to the Lord and exalt the King of all ages, and you will receive salvation from Him with great joy.

(Tobit 13:10) 
O Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord will punish you for the works of your hands,

(Tobit 13:11) 
but then He will again have mercy on you through the works of the righteous.

(Tobit 13:12) 
Give thanks to the Lord with goodness, and bless the King of all ages, so that His dwelling place in you may be rebuilt with joy. And may the Lord gladden all the miserable in you, and lift up all the downtrodden for generations to come.

(Tobit 13:13) 
Be enlightened, O Jerusalem, city of God, and you will receive all gifts with goodness. And there will be joy for you for generations throughout time.

(Tobit 13:14) 
Nations will come to you from afar, drawn by your light, bringing gifts and worshipping the Lord in you, and they will hold your land as sacred.

(Tobit 13:15) 
All the surrounding peoples of your generations will bless you, and they will receive a great blessing.

(Tobit 13:16) 
Rejoice and praise the names of those who have been made joyful in you. Rejoice and praise all the people who bring about peace in you.

(Tobit 13:17) 
Blessed be the Lord, who has exalted you, and may His kingdom be in you through all ages of ages. Amen.

(Tobit 13:18) 
Many will come from afar, dwelling in the name of the Lord God, bringing gifts with them, and offerings to the King of the universe. Generations of generations will rejoice in you, and the name of the chosen city will remain through all ages.

(Tobit 13:19) 
Cursed are all who hate you, and blessed are all who love you for all ages.

(Tobit 13:20) 
In all things, they will rejoice and bless you.

(Tobit 14:1) 
So, Tobias lived out the rest of his days in joy. He continued to walk in the ways of God, filled with reverence for Him.

(Tobit 14:2) 
When he was one hundred and twelve years old, and his son Tobias was sixty-two, he died in glory—a blessed death.

(Tobit 14:3) 
However, he rejoiced even more at the news of Nineveh's destruction. He also lived to see the captives from Nineveh being led into Media by Ahasuerus, the King of the Persians. And Tobias blessed the Lord God for everything He had done to the disobedient and the wicked.

(Tobit 14:4) 
And before he died, he called his son Tobias and his seven young grandsons, and he said to them: "My sons, take note of how Nineveh will be destroyed, and how the word of the Lord, which He spoke through the prophets of Israel, will be fulfilled."

(Tobit 14:5) 
"And believe all that God has spoken through the prophets of Israel, because these things will surely come to pass, and not one word from them will fail."

(Tobit 14:6) 
"And all our brethren, who are in the land of Israel, will be scattered throughout all the borders of their own land."

(Tobit 14:7) 
"But just as they will be scattered, so too will they be gathered again. They will be brought back into the land of Israel."

(Tobit 14:8) 
"And they will rebuild the Temple of God there—not as it was before, but larger and more glorious."

(Tobit 14:9) 
"And all who are in captivity from Israel will return, and they will live in the house of the Lord."

(Tobit 14:10) 
"And there will be no true nation there for many generations; but after these times, the city will be rebuilt, and the Temple will be even more glorious."

(Tobit 14:11) 
"And all who had fled will return to it."

(Tobit 14:12) 
"And all nations will turn to the Lord God of truth, and they will abandon their idols."

(Tobit 14:13) 
"And they will bless the Lord God in all things, and they will exalt Him in every place throughout their land."

(Tobit 14:14) 
"And they will glorify Him, and all the nations together, and every creature that is in the sky and that is on the earth will praise Him in all His works."

(Tobit 14:15) 
"And there will be peace and salvation for all the saints. Amen."

(Tobit 14:1) 
And so, everything Tobit had prophesied came to pass. After his sight was restored, he lived for one hundred and twelve years, and he was blessed to see his children's children, even to the fifth generation of his descendants.

(Tobit 14:2) 
Then he went to Media, to his wife Anna, and lived with her, and grew old in peace, surrounded by his family.

(Tobit 14:3) 
Before his death, he called his son Tobias and his six grandchildren—the sons of Tobias—and instructed them, saying:

(Tobit 14:4) 
“My son, make haste and go to Media, for I believe the word of the Lord, which He spoke through the prophet Nahum concerning Nineveh. It will happen exactly as He said, and there will be a great destruction of that city for a time, as foretold by God.”

(Tobit 14:5) 
“And I know that whoever from the land of Israel remains there will be scattered abroad and all will be taken captive from their good land, and they will come into Media.”

(Tobit 14:6) 
“And again, all those who are in the land of Israel will remember God, and they will return from all their places of dispersion, and they will rebuild Jerusalem and the house of God within it, but not as it was at first, until the fullness of the times of the generation comes.”

(Tobit 14:7) 
“And after this, all will return from their captivity, and they will rebuild Jerusalem magnificently. The house of God within it, as He spoke concerning it, will be built for all generations, a magnificent structure.”

(Tobit 14:8) 
“And all who fear the Lord will rebuild it in all truth. They will abandon all their idols and their blasphemies, and all the peoples will bless the Lord.”

(Tobit 14:9) 
“And all the people will confess and exalt God, His entire people, for all ages.”

(Tobit 14:10) 
“And all who practice justice throughout the whole world in that time will bless the Lord. All who fear the Lord will exalt Him in it, all of them in truth, and remembering our sins for His mercy.”

(Tobit 14:11) 
“And now, children, listen to your father, and serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do what is pleasing to Him.”

(Tobit 14:12) 
“Do not seek to remain in wickedness, nor transgress His commandment.”

(Tobit 14:13) 
“All the days of your life, my son, keep God in your mind, and be careful never to sin, nor to abandon His commandments.”

(Tobit 14:14) 
“In all the days of your life, do good, and do not seek what is evil.”

(Tobit 14:15) 
And Tobias lived for one hundred and seventeen years, and he saw seven of his grandchildren before he died. He passed away in glory, and all of Israel mourned him. (This chapter continues with the details of Tobias the younger.)
