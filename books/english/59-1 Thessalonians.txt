(1 Thessalonians 1:1) 
From Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy: to the church of the Thessalonians, who are united to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 1:2) 
Grace to you, and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers without ceasing,

(1 Thessalonians 1:3) 
constantly remembering your work of faith and your labor, and the love and patience of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God our Father:

(1 Thessalonians 1:4) 
Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election:

(1 Thessalonians 1:5) 
Because our Gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, just as you know what kind of men we were among you, for your sakes.

(1 Thessalonians 1:6) 
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word with much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,

(1 Thessalonians 1:7) 
so that you were made a pattern to all those who believe, in Macedonia and in Achaia.

(1 Thessalonians 1:8) 
For from you has gone forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith, which is toward God, has gone forth, so that we need not to speak anything.

(1 Thessalonians 1:9) 
For they themselves relate of us what kind of entrance we had to you: and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,

(1 Thessalonians 1:10) 
and to await His Son from the universe—Jesus—whom He raised from the dead, who has delivered us from the wrath to come.

(1 Thessalonians 2:1) 
You know yourselves, brothers, that we didn’t come to you in vain, wasting time or energy:

(1 Thessalonians 2:2) 
But after suffering and enduring insults, as you know, in Philippi, we had the courage given to us by God to preach to you in difficult times.

(1 Thessalonians 2:3) 
For our encouragement did not come from error, nor from uncleanness, nor from trickery:

(1 Thessalonians 2:4) 
but as we were proven worthy by God, that the Gospel be entrusted to us, so do we speak, not as those pleasing men, but God, who knows our hearts.

(1 Thessalonians 2:5) 
For at no time were we in speech with flattery, as you know: nor with an occasion for greed: God is witness.

(1 Thessalonians 2:6) 
Nor seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others:

(1 Thessalonians 2:7) 
though we could have been a burden to you, in order to seek the glory of Christ:

(1 Thessalonians 2:8) 
but we became little ones among you, as a mother would nurture her children:

(1 Thessalonians 2:9) 
in this way, we longed for you, and eagerly wished to hand over to you not only the Gospel of God, but also our souls: because you have become very dear to us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:10) 
For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: for working night and day, so that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Gospel of God.

(1 Thessalonians 2:11) 
You are witnesses, and God is too: how holy, just, and blameless we were among you who believed:

(1 Thessalonians 2:12) 
as you know, how we exhorted each of you, as a father does his children,

(1 Thessalonians 2:13) 
assuring, consoling, and testifying to you, that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.

(1 Thessalonians 2:14) 
For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing: because when you received from us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as it truly is the word of God, which works in you who believe.

(1 Thessalonians 2:15) 
For you have become imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: because the same things that they suffered were also suffered by you from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,

(1 Thessalonians 2:16) 
who also killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us, and do not please God, and are against all men,

(1 Thessalonians 2:17) 
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, so that they may always fill up their sins: for the wrath of God has come upon them to the end.

(1 Thessalonians 2:18) 
But we, brothers, being left desolate from you for a time, in appearance, not in heart, we eagerly sought all the more to see your face with great desire.

(1 Thessalonians 2:19) 
Because we wanted to come to you, I, indeed, Paul, once and again: and Satan prevented us.

(1 Thessalonians 2:20) 
For who is our hope, or joy, or the crown of glory? Are you not? Before our Lord Jesus at His coming?

(1 Thessalonians 2:21) 
For you are our glory and joy.

(1 Thessalonians 3:1) 
Because of this, we could not bear to remain alone in Athens.

(1 Thessalonians 3:2) 
So we sent our brother Timothy, a servant of God in the Gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and to exhort you in your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:3) 
We sent him so that no one would be shaken by these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.

(1 Thessalonians 3:4) 
For when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we would suffer tribulation, even as it came to pass, and as you know.

(1 Thessalonians 3:5) 
For this cause, I also, not bearing it any longer, sent to know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter has tempted you and our labor become vain.

(1 Thessalonians 3:6) 
But now, Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and your charity and that you have a good memory of us always, desiring to see us, just as we also want to see you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:7) 
Therefore, brothers, we have been comforted about you in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith.

(1 Thessalonians 3:8) 
Because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 3:9) 
For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before God,

(1 Thessalonians 3:10) 
night and day praying more abundantly that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?

(1 Thessalonians 3:11) 
Now God Himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:12) 
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love towards one another and towards all men, even as we do towards you.

(1 Thessalonians 3:13) 
So that he may establish your hearts without blame, in holiness before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(1 Thessalonians 4:1) 
And now, brothers, we beg you and beseech you in the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is our earnest desire that you continue living the holy life that we have taught you, the life that is pleasing to God, and that you do it even more and more.

(1 Thessalonians 4:2) 
For you know very well what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:3) 
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you stay away from all sexual sin,

(1 Thessalonians 4:4) 
that each of you knows how to control his own body in holiness and honor,

(1 Thessalonians 4:5) 
and not in the lust of passion, as the Gentiles who do not know God do:

(1 Thessalonians 4:6) 
that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter. For the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you and testified before.

(1 Thessalonians 4:7) 
For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.

(1 Thessalonians 4:8) 
Therefore, he who rejects this, rejects not man, but God, who has also given His Holy Spirit to you.

(1 Thessalonians 4:9) 
Now concerning fraternal love, we do not need to write to you. For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.

(1 Thessalonians 4:10) 
For indeed you do this toward all the brothers who are in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to increase more and more,

(1 Thessalonians 4:11) 
and to strive to be at peace, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we have commanded you,

(1 Thessalonians 4:12) 
so that you may walk honestly toward those who are outside, and that you may not lack anything.

(1 Thessalonians 4:13) 
But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve as the others do who have no hope.

(1 Thessalonians 4:14) 
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 4:15) 
For this we tell you by the word of the Lord: that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.

(1 Thessalonians 4:16) 
For the Lord Himself, with a command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from the sky: and the dead who are in Christ will rise first.

(1 Thessalonians 4:17) 
Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air: and so we will always be with the Lord.

(1 Thessalonians 4:18) 
Therefore, comfort one another with these words.

(1 Thessalonians 5:1) 
Now concerning the times and moments, brothers and sisters, there is no need to write to you about it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:2) 
For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:3) 
When they say “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a woman giving birth, and they will not escape.

(1 Thessalonians 5:4) 
But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, that this day should overtake you as a thief.

(1 Thessalonians 5:5) 
For you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night nor of darkness.

(1 Thessalonians 5:6) 
Therefore let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us keep awake and be sober.

(1 Thessalonians 5:7) 
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.

(1 Thessalonians 5:8) 
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of the hope of salvation.

(1 Thessalonians 5:9) 
For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

(1 Thessalonians 5:10) 
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.

(1 Thessalonians 5:11) 
Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, as indeed you are doing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:12) 
We ask you, brothers and sisters, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

(1 Thessalonians 5:13) 
and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

(1 Thessalonians 5:14) 
And we exhort you, brothers and sisters, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:15) 
See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good, both for yourselves and for all.

(1 Thessalonians 5:16) 
Rejoice always.

(1 Thessalonians 5:17) 
Pray without ceasing.

(1 Thessalonians 5:18) 
In everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

(1 Thessalonians 5:19) 
Do not quench the Spirit.

(1 Thessalonians 5:20) 
Do not despise prophecies,

(1 Thessalonians 5:21) 
but test everything; hold fast to what is good.

(1 Thessalonians 5:22) 
Abstain from every form of evil.

(1 Thessalonians 5:23) 
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

(1 Thessalonians 5:24) 
He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.

(1 Thessalonians 5:25) 
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

(1 Thessalonians 5:26) 
Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

(1 Thessalonians 5:27) 
I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the holy brothers and sisters.

(1 Thessalonians 5:28) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
