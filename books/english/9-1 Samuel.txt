(1 Samuel 1:1) 
There was a certain man from Ramathaim Sophim, from the mountain region of Ephraim. His name was Elcana, a son of Jeroham, who was a son of Eliu, who was a son of Thohu, who was a son of Suph—he was an Ephratite.

(1 Samuel 1:2) 
He had two wives: the name of one was Anna, and the name of the second was Phenenna. Phenenna had children, but Anna had no children.

(1 Samuel 1:3) 
And this man would go up from his city at the appointed times each year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. Heli’s two sons, Ophni and Phinees, were serving there as priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 1:4) 
Whenever the day came for the sacrifice, Elcana would make his offering. He would give portions to his wife Phenenna, and to all her sons and daughters.

(1 Samuel 1:5) 
But to Anna, he gave only one portion, and he was sorrowful, for Anna had no children. The Lord had closed her womb, so she could not conceive.

(1 Samuel 1:6) 
Her rival wife, Phenenna, also tormented her and greatly distressed her, constantly taunting Anna over the fact that the Lord had closed her womb.

(1 Samuel 1:7) 
And she did this year after year, whenever they went up to the temple of the Lord. Phenenna would provoke Anna, and Anna would weep and refuse to eat.

(1 Samuel 1:8) 
Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: “Anna, why are you weeping? And why are you not eating? And why is your heart so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons would be?”

(1 Samuel 1:9) 
So Anna rose up after they had eaten and drunk in Silo. Heli the priest was sitting on a seat by the doorposts of the Lord’s temple.

(1 Samuel 1:10) 
Anna was in deep bitterness of soul. She prayed to the Lord, weeping profusely.

(1 Samuel 1:11) 
And she made a solemn vow, saying: “Lord of hosts, if You would only look upon the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, and grant your handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life. And no razor will ever come upon his head—meaning he will be dedicated to You as a Nazirite.”

(1 Samuel 1:12) 
It so happened that as she continued to multiply her prayers before the Lord, Heli observed her mouth.

(1 Samuel 1:13) 
Now, Anna was speaking in her heart; only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard. So Heli thought she was drunk.

(1 Samuel 1:14) 
And he said to her: “How long will you be drunk? Sober up from your wine for a little while, which has made you intoxicated.”

(1 Samuel 1:15) 
Anna answered and said: “No, my lord, I am a woman with a deeply troubled spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor anything that could make me drunk; instead, I have poured out my very soul before the Lord.”

(1 Samuel 1:16) 
Do not consider your handmaid to be one of the daughters of Belial—a worthless or wicked woman. For it is out of the abundance of my great sorrow and grief that I have spoken until now.”

(1 Samuel 1:17) 
Then Heli answered and said: “Go in peace. And may the God of Israel grant you your petition, which you have asked from Him.”

(1 Samuel 1:18) 
And she said: “May your handmaid find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went on her way, and she ate, and her countenance was no longer downcast or troubled.

(1 Samuel 1:19) 
They rose up early in the morning and worshipped before the Lord. Then they returned and came to their home in Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife, and the Lord remembered her by granting her request.

(1 Samuel 1:20) 
And so it was that after the passage of some days, Anna conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, because she had asked for him from the Lord.

(1 Samuel 1:21) 
Then Elcana, along with all his household, went up to offer to the Lord his annual sacrifice and his solemn vow.

(1 Samuel 1:22) 
But Anna did not go up. Instead, she said to her husband: “I will not go until the child is weaned. Then I will bring him, and he will appear before the presence of the Lord, and he will remain there permanently.”

(1 Samuel 1:23) 
And Elcana, her husband, said to her: “Do what seems good to you. Stay here until you wean him, provided only that the Lord may fulfill His word concerning the child’s dedication.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.

(1 Samuel 1:24) 
And after she had weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three young bullocks, three measures of flour, and a jar of wine. She brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. The boy was still very young.

(1 Samuel 1:25) 
And they sacrificed a bullock, and they brought the boy to Heli.

(1 Samuel 1:26) 
And Anna said: “I beg you, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord—I am that very woman who stood here before you, praying to the Lord.”

(1 Samuel 1:27) 
“It was for this very boy that I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition which I asked from Him.”

(1 Samuel 1:28) 
“Therefore, I have also entrusted him to the Lord for all the days of his life, that he may remain dedicated to the Lord.” And they worshipped the Lord there.

(1 Samuel 1:1) 
There was a man from Ramathaim-Zophim, in the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elcana, and he was the son of Jeroham, son of Eliu, son of Thohu, son of Suph, an Ephraimite.

(1 Samuel 1:2) 
He had two wives: one was named Anna, and the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children, but Anna had no children.

(1 Samuel 1:3) 
That man would go up from his city each year at the appointed times to worship and offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. Now, the two sons of Eli, Ophni and Phinees, were serving there as priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 1:4) 
So when the day came for Elcana to offer the sacrifice, he gave portions of the meat to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters.

(1 Samuel 1:5) 
But to Anna, he gave a special portion, though his heart was heavy, because Anna had no son, for the Lord had closed her womb.

(1 Samuel 1:6) 
Her rival, Phenenna, also tormented and greatly distressed her constantly because the Lord had closed Anna's womb and she had no children.

(1 Samuel 1:7) 
This continued year after year; whenever they went up to the house of the Lord, Phenenna would provoke her. So Anna would weep and refuse to eat anything.

(1 Samuel 1:8) 
Then Elcana, her husband, said to her, 'Anna, why are you weeping? Why do you refuse to eat? And why is your spirit so downcast? Am I not better to you than ten sons?'

(1 Samuel 1:9) 
After they had finished eating and drinking in Silo, Anna stood up. Now Eli, the priest, was sitting on his chair by the doorposts of the Lord's house.

(1 Samuel 1:10) 
With a bitter and heavy spirit, Anna prayed to the Lord, weeping profusely.

(1 Samuel 1:11) 
And she made a solemn vow, saying, 'O Lord of hosts, if You would truly look upon the affliction of Your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but grant Your handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever touch his head—a commitment to a Nazirite vow.'

(1 Samuel 1:12) 
As Anna continued to pray at great length before the Lord, Eli was observing her mouth.

(1 Samuel 1:13) 
Anna was praying silently within her heart; only her lips were moving, and her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.

(1 Samuel 1:14) 
And Eli said to her, 'How long will you be drunk? Put away the wine and sober up!'

(1 Samuel 1:15) 
Anna answered, 'No, my lord, I am not drunk. I am a woman with a deeply sorrowful spirit. I have drunk no wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my heart before the Lord in prayer.'

(1 Samuel 1:16) 
Do not take your handmaid for a worthless woman, for it is out of the depth of my great pain and sorrow that I have been speaking up to now.

(1 Samuel 1:17) 
Then Eli answered, 'Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you the request you have made of Him.'

(1 Samuel 1:18) 
And Anna said, 'May your handmaid find favor in your sight.' Then the woman went her way, and she ate, and her face was no longer sad.

(1 Samuel 1:19) 
They rose early in the morning, worshipped before the Lord, then returned and came to their home in Ramatha. And Elcana was intimate with his wife, Anna, and the Lord remembered her prayer.

(1 Samuel 1:20) 
And when the time came around, Anna conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, saying, 'Because I asked the Lord for him.'

(1 Samuel 1:21) 
Then Elcana, her husband, went up with his entire household to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow.

(1 Samuel 1:22) 
But Anna did not go up. Instead, she said to her husband, 'I will wait until the child is weaned. Then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the Lord and remain there in His house always.'

(1 Samuel 1:23) 
Elcana, her husband, said to her, 'Do what seems best to you. Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word concerning our son.' So the woman stayed home and nursed her son until she weaned him.

(1 Samuel 1:24) 
When she had weaned him, she brought him up to Silo, taking with her three calves, three measures of flour, and a jar of wine, as offerings. She brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. The child was still very young.

(1 Samuel 1:25) 
Then they sacrificed one of the calves, and Anna brought the child to Eli.

(1 Samuel 1:26) 
And Anna said, 'Oh, my lord! As surely as you live, my lord, I am the very woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.'

(1 Samuel 1:27) 
It was for this child that I prayed, and the Lord has granted me the request I made of Him.

(1 Samuel 1:28) 
Therefore, I have dedicated him to the Lord; for as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the Lord.' And they worshipped the Lord there.

(1 Samuel 2:1) 
My heart has leapt with joy in the Lord God, and my strength—my horn—has been raised up in my God. My mouth is now opened wide to speak confidently against my enemies, because I have rejoiced greatly in your saving power.

(1 Samuel 2:2) 
No one is holy like the Lord God; indeed, there is no one else beside you, and no one is strong like our God.

(1 Samuel 2:3) 
Do not speak proudly with multiplied boastings; let your former arrogance cease from your mouth. For the Lord God is the God who knows everything, and all thoughts are prepared before Him.

(1 Samuel 2:4) 
The bow of the mighty has been overcome, but the weak have been girded with strength.

(1 Samuel 2:5) 
Those who were barren before have given birth to many children, and she who had many children has become weak.

(1 Samuel 2:6) 
The Lord God brings death and brings life; He leads down to the realm of the dead and brings back up from it.

(1 Samuel 2:7) 
The Lord God makes one poor and makes one rich; He humbles and He exalts.

(1 Samuel 2:8) 
He lifts up the needy from the dust of the ground, and raises the poor from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a throne of glory.

(1 Samuel 2:9) 
For the pillars of the earth belong to the Lord God, and upon them He has set the world.

(1 Samuel 2:10) 
He will guard the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. For no man will be strong through his own power.

(1 Samuel 2:11) 
The Lord God will thunder from the heavens against him; the Lord God will judge the ends of the earth, and He will give dominion to His king, and exalt the power—the horn—of His Anointed One.

(1 Samuel 2:12) 
And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his home. But the young boy Samuel remained a minister of the Lord God before Heli the priest.

(1 Samuel 2:13) 
Now the sons of Heli were worthless men who did not know the Lord God, nor did they perform the duty of priests toward the people as they should have.

(1 Samuel 2:14) 
Indeed, this was the way of the priests with the people: whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, and he would have a three-pronged fork in his hand.

(1 Samuel 2:15) 
He would thrust it into the large pot, or into the cauldron, or into the stewpot, or into the small pot, and whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they acted with all the people of Israel who came to Silo.

(1 Samuel 2:16) 
Even before they burned the fat of the sacrifice—which was reserved for God—the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, 'Give me meat to cook for the priest, for I will not accept cooked meat from you, but raw meat.'

(1 Samuel 2:17) 
And the one offering the sacrifice would answer him, 'Let the fat be burned first today as is the custom, and then take for yourself whatever your heart desires.' But the servant, responding, would say to him, 'Absolutely not! You will give it to me at once. If you do not, I will take it by force.'

(1 Samuel 2:18) 
Therefore, the sin of the young men was excessively great before the Lord God, because they caused people to turn away from the sacrifice due to the Lord God.

(1 Samuel 2:19) 
But Samuel, a young boy, ministered before the Lord God, dressed in a linen ephod, a priestly garment.

(1 Samuel 2:20) 
And his mother used to make him a little tunic, which she would bring to him on the appointed days when she went up with her husband to offer the solemn sacrifice.

(1 Samuel 2:21) 
So Heli blessed Elcana and his wife, and said, 'May the Lord God give you offspring from this woman in return for the gift you lent to the Lord God—the boy Samuel.' And they went to their home.

(1 Samuel 2:22) 
And so, the Lord God visited Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in stature before the Lord God.

(1 Samuel 2:23) 
Now Heli had grown very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle of the covenant.

(1 Samuel 2:24) 
And he said to them, 'Why are you doing such things, which I hear reported as very wicked deeds by all the people?'

(1 Samuel 2:25) 
'Do not do this, my sons, for the report I hear is not good. You are causing the Lord God's people to transgress.'

(1 Samuel 2:26) 
'If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against the Lord God, who will intercede for him?' But they did not listen to their father's voice, because the Lord God intended to put them to death.

(1 Samuel 2:27) 
But the boy Samuel continued to grow and advance in favor with both the Lord God and with men.

(1 Samuel 2:28) 
Then a man of God came to Heli and said to him, 'Thus says the Lord God: Did I not plainly reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt, in the house of Pharaoh?'

(1 Samuel 2:29) 
'And I chose him—your ancestor Aaron—from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, and burn incense to Me, and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel.'

(1 Samuel 2:30) 
'Why then have you kicked away My sacrifice and My offerings which I commanded to be presented in the temple? And why have you honored your sons more than Me, so that you yourselves are made fat from the best parts of every sacrifice of My people Israel?'

(1 Samuel 2:31) 
'Therefore, thus says the Lord God of Israel: I indeed said that your house and the house of your father would minister before Me forever. But now the Lord God says: Far be this from Me! Instead, whoever honors Me, I will honor him; but those who despise Me will be made insignificant.'

(1 Samuel 2:32) 
'Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength—your arm—and the strength of your father's house, so that there will be no old man in your household.'

(1 Samuel 2:33) 
'And you will see an adversary in the temple, amidst all the prosperity of Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house for all your days.'

(1 Samuel 2:34) 
'And this will be the sign for you, which will happen to your two sons, Ophni and Phinees: both of them will die on the same day.'

(1 Samuel 2:35) 
'And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will act according to My heart and My soul. And I will build him a sure house, and he will walk before My Anointed One all his days.'

(1 Samuel 2:36) 
'And it will come to pass that everyone who remains in your house will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and say, 'Please, assign me to one of the priestly portions, so that I may eat a morsel of bread.''

(1 Samuel 2:1) 
And Anna prayed, saying: 'My heart has rejoiced in the Lord; my strength, like a horn lifted high, has been made great by my God. My voice now speaks triumphantly over my enemies, because I have found great joy in Your deliverance.'

(1 Samuel 2:2) 
There is no one holy like the Lord; indeed, there is no other God besides You, and no one is as strong as our God.

(1 Samuel 2:3) 
Do not speak many proud and boastful words; let arrogance depart from your mouths. For the Lord is the God of all knowledge, and He weighs every thought and intention.

(1 Samuel 2:4) 
The bows of the mighty are broken, but those who were weak are now girded with strength.

(1 Samuel 2:5) 
Those who were once full and well-fed are now reduced to working for bread, while those who were starving are now satisfied. Even the barren woman has borne many children, and she who had many children has become feeble and desolate.

(1 Samuel 2:6) 
The Lord brings death and brings life; He leads down to the realm of the dead and brings back up again.

(1 Samuel 2:7) 
The Lord makes one poor and makes one rich; He humbles and He exalts.

(1 Samuel 2:8) 
He lifts the needy from the dust and raises the poor from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a glorious throne. For the foundations of the earth are the Lord's, and He has established the world upon them.

(1 Samuel 2:9) 
He will guard the steps of His saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. For no one is strong by their own might.

(1 Samuel 2:10) 
His adversaries will fear the Lord; over them He will thunder from the universe. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth, and He will give power to His King, and He will exalt the strength of His Anointed One.

(1 Samuel 2:11) 
Then Elcana went to his home in Ramatha. But the child Samuel remained as a minister of the Lord, serving before Eli the priest.

(1 Samuel 2:12) 
Now the sons of Eli were wicked men, sons of Belial, who did not know or acknowledge the Lord.

(1 Samuel 2:13) 
Nor did they respect the priests' duty to the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, holding a three-pronged fork in his hand.

(1 Samuel 2:14) 
And he would thrust it into the cauldron, or the pot, or the kettle, or the pan. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Silo.

(1 Samuel 2:15) 
Even before the fat was burned as an offering, the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice: 'Give me meat to roast for the priest, for I will not accept cooked meat from you, but only raw meat.'

(1 Samuel 2:16) 
And the man offering the sacrifice would answer him: 'Let the fat be burned first today, as is the custom, then take for yourself whatever your soul desires.' But the servant would say to him: 'No, by no means; you must give it to me immediately, or else I will take it by force.'

(1 Samuel 2:17) 
Therefore, the sin of these young men was exceedingly great before the Lord, because they were causing men to withdraw from offering sacrifice to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 2:18) 
But Samuel, the young boy, ministered before the Lord, clothed with a linen ephod, a sacred garment.

(1 Samuel 2:19) 
And his mother used to make him a little tunic, which she would bring to him year after year, when she would go up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

(1 Samuel 2:20) 
And Eli blessed Elcana and his wife, and he said: 'May the Lord grant you offspring from this woman in return for the one that was given to the Lord.' Then they went to their home.

(1 Samuel 2:21) 
So the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in importance before the Lord.

(1 Samuel 2:22) 
Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all of Israel; specifically, how they were lying with the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle of the covenant.

(1 Samuel 2:23) 
And he said to them: 'Why are you doing such things? I hear of these very wicked deeds from all the people.'

(1 Samuel 2:24) 
'Do not, my sons, for the report I hear is not good, that you cause the Lord's people to transgress.'

(1 Samuel 2:25) 
If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the Lord, who can pray for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, for the Lord had already decided to put them to death.

(1 Samuel 2:26) 
But the boy Samuel continued to grow and advance in stature and favor, pleasing both the Lord and mankind.

(1 Samuel 2:27) 
Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him: 'Thus says the Lord: Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt, in the house of Pharaoh?'

(1 Samuel 2:28) 
'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to ascend to My altar, to burn incense for Me, and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel.'

(1 Samuel 2:29) 
'Why then have you kicked aside My sacrifice and My offerings, which I commanded to be offered in the temple? And why have you honored your sons more than Me, enriching yourselves with the best parts of every sacrifice of My servant Israel?'

(1 Samuel 2:30) 
Therefore, the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I indeed said that your house and the house of your father would minister before Me forever. But now the Lord says: Far be it from Me! Rather, whoever glorifies Me, him will I glorify; but those who despise Me shall be brought to dishonor.'

(1 Samuel 2:31) 
'Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will be no old man in your house.'

(1 Samuel 2:32) 
'And you will see an adversary in My dwelling place, amidst all the prosperity of Israel, yet there will be no old man in your house for all your days.'

(1 Samuel 2:33) 
'Nevertheless, I will not cut off every last one of yours from My altar, but only so that his eyes may fail and his soul waste away. And all the offspring of your house will die in the prime of their lives.'

(1 Samuel 2:34) 
'And this will be the sign for you, which is about to come to pass regarding your two sons, Ophni and Phinees: on one day, both will die.'

(1 Samuel 2:35) 
'And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will act according to My heart and My soul. And I will build him a faithful house, and he will walk before My Anointed One all his days.'

(1 Samuel 2:36) 
'And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down before him to receive a silver coin and a loaf of bread, and will say: 'Please, let me belong to one of the priestly portions, so that I may eat a morsel of bread.''

(1 Samuel 2:37) 
There is no thirty-seventh verse.

(1 Samuel 2:38) 
There is no thirty-eighth verse.

(1 Samuel 2:39) 
There is no thirty-ninth verse.

(1 Samuel 2:40) 
There is no fortieth verse.

(1 Samuel 3:1) 
The boy Samuel was serving the Lord in the presence of Eli, but in those days, the word of the Lord was rare, and there were no clear visions or prophecies from God.

(1 Samuel 3:2) 
And it came to pass on a certain occasion that Eli was sleeping in his customary place. His eyes had grown so dim that he could not see.

(1 Samuel 3:3) 
Before the lamps in the house of God had been extinguished for the morning, Samuel was sleeping in the Lord's sanctuary, where the Ark of God was kept.

(1 Samuel 3:4) 
And the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, saying, 'Here I am.'

(1 Samuel 3:5) 
So Samuel ran to Eli and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Eli replied, 'I did not call you. Go back to sleep.' So Samuel went and lay down again.

(1 Samuel 3:6) 
And the Lord called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Eli answered, 'I did not call you, my son. Go back to sleep.'

(1 Samuel 3:7) 
Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord personally in this manner, nor had the word of the Lord been revealed to him in such a way before.

(1 Samuel 3:8) 
And the Lord called Samuel a third time. Samuel rose, went to Eli, and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Then Eli understood that it was the Lord calling the boy.

(1 Samuel 3:9) 
So Eli said to Samuel, 'Go and sleep. If He calls you again, you are to say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'' So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

(1 Samuel 3:10) 
And the Lord came and stood there, and called as He had called before, 'Samuel, Samuel!' And Samuel said, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'

(1 Samuel 3:11) 
And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Behold, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of everyone who hears of it ring with shock.'

(1 Samuel 3:12) 
'On that very day, I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken against his house, from beginning to end.'

(1 Samuel 3:13) 
'For I have told him that I will judge his house forever because of the iniquity of his sons, who have blasphemed God, and he did not restrain them.'

(1 Samuel 3:14) 
'Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli: The iniquity of his house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering, not for all time.'

(1 Samuel 3:15) 
So Samuel slept until morning, and then he opened the doors of the Lord's house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision.

(1 Samuel 3:16) 
Eli then called Samuel and said, 'Samuel, my son.' And Samuel answered, 'Here I am.'

(1 Samuel 3:17) 
Eli said, 'What is the message that was given to you? I implore you, do not hide it from me. May God do to you even worse, if you hide from me even one of all the words that were spoken to you.'

(1 Samuel 3:18) 
So Samuel told him all the words and hid nothing from him. Eli then responded, 'It is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His sight.'

(1 Samuel 3:19) 
Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and none of His words that He spoke through Samuel fell to the ground unfulfilled.

(1 Samuel 3:20) 
And all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, recognized that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 3:21) 
And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 4:1) 
It happened during that time that the Philistines gathered their forces for war. The people of Israel went out to fight against them, and set up their camp near a place called Ebenezer—which means 'Stone of Help'.

(1 Samuel 4:2) 
Israel lined up for battle against the Philistines. When the fighting began, the people of Israel turned and fled from the Philistines. About thirty thousand of Israel’s foot soldiers were killed there.

(1 Samuel 4:3) 
When the surviving people returned to their camp, the leading elders of Israel said: 'Why did the Lord allow the Philistines to defeat us today? Let us bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from Shiloh, and let it come into our midst. Then it will save us from the power of our enemies.'

(1 Samuel 4:4) 
So the people sent word to Shiloh, and they brought from there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts, who sits enthroned above the Cherubim. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were with the Ark of God's Covenant.

(1 Samuel 4:5) 
When the Ark of the Lord's Covenant arrived in the camp, all of Israel shouted with a great outcry, and the entire land echoed with the sound.

(1 Samuel 4:6) 
The Philistines heard the sound of the outcry and asked: 'What is this sound of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' They quickly realized that the Ark of the Lord had come into their camp.

(1 Samuel 4:7) 
Then the Philistines became afraid and said: 'God has come into their camp!' They groaned in fear and said:

(1 Samuel 4:8) 
'Woe to us! Nothing like this great rejoicing has happened before, not yesterday nor the day before! Woe to us! Who will save us from the power of this mighty God? These are the gods who struck Egypt with every kind of plague in the wilderness.'

(1 Samuel 4:9) 
'Be strong, Philistines! Act like men! Do not serve the Hebrews, just as they have served you. Be men, and fight!'

(1 Samuel 4:10) 
So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was exceedingly great, and thirty thousand men of Israel fell dead.

(1 Samuel 4:11) 
And the Ark of God was captured. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.

(1 Samuel 4:12) 
But a man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day. His clothes were torn, and his head was covered with dust, showing his grief and distress.

(1 Samuel 4:13) 
When he arrived, Eli was sitting on a chair beside the road, looking out—for his heart was trembling with fear for the Ark of God. After the man entered, he announced the news to the city, and the entire city cried out in lament.

(1 Samuel 4:14) 
Eli heard the sound of the outcry and asked: 'What is this sound of a great uproar?' The man hurried, came to Eli, and told him the news.

(1 Samuel 4:15) 
Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes had grown dim, so he could not see.

(1 Samuel 4:16) 
The man said to Eli: 'I am the one who came from the battle. I fled from the battle line today.' Eli then asked him: 'What happened, my son?'

(1 Samuel 4:17) 
The messenger answered: 'Israel has fled before the Philistines, and a great slaughter has occurred among the people. Moreover, your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead. And the Ark of God has been captured.'

(1 Samuel 4:18) 
When the messenger mentioned the Ark of God, Eli fell backward from his chair beside the gate. His neck was broken, and he died. For the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.

(1 Samuel 4:19) 
His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she bowed down and gave birth, for sudden labor pains came upon her.

(1 Samuel 4:20) 
Just as she was dying, those who stood around her said: 'Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son!' But she did not answer, nor did she pay attention to their words.

(1 Samuel 4:21) 
And she named the child Ichabod, saying: 'The glory has departed from Israel,' because the Ark of God had been captured, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.

(1 Samuel 4:22) 
She emphasized, 'The glory has departed from Israel, because the Ark of God has been captured!'

(1 Samuel 5:1) 
And the Philistines took the Ark of God, carrying it away from the Stone of Help—the place where Israel was defeated—to the city of Ashdod.

(1 Samuel 5:2) 
So the Philistines took the Ark of God into the temple of their god Dagon and set it up right next to the idol of Dagon.

(1 Samuel 5:3) 
When the people of Ashdod woke up the next morning, they found Dagon lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord. So they picked up Dagon and put him back in his place.

(1 Samuel 5:4) 
But when they got up early the following morning, they again found Dagon lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord. This time, Dagon's head and both of his hands were cut off and lying on the threshold of the temple, with only the trunk of Dagon's body remaining intact.

(1 Samuel 5:5) 
Because of this event, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod have not stepped on the threshold of Dagon, even to this very day.

(1 Samuel 5:6) 
But the hand of the Lord weighed heavily upon the people of Ashdod, and He devastated them. He struck the people of Ashdod and their surrounding territory in their own homes, causing painful tumors to break out on them.

(1 Samuel 5:7) 
When the men of Ashdod saw the nature of this plague, they said, "The Ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon, our god."

(1 Samuel 5:8) 
So they sent for and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines to them and asked, "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the Ark of the God of Israel be taken around to Gath." So the Ark of the God of Israel was carried there.

(1 Samuel 5:9) 
After it was carried to Gath, the hand of the Lord fell upon that city with extremely great destruction. He struck the men of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, and painful tumors broke out on them.

(1 Samuel 5:10) 
So they sent the Ark of God to Ekron. When the Ark of God arrived in Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, saying, "They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us, intending to kill us and our people!"

(1 Samuel 5:11) 
So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel! Let it return to its own place, so it will not kill us and our people." For a confusion of death—a deadly panic—had spread throughout the entire city, and the hand of God was very heavy there.

(1 Samuel 5:12) 
Even the men who did not die were tormented with tumors, and the wailing of each city went up to the sky.

(1 Samuel 5:1) 
The Philistines took the Ark of God, and carried it away from the Stone of Help to Azotus.

(1 Samuel 5:2) 
And the Philistines brought the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon, and set it beside Dagon.

(1 Samuel 5:3) 
But when the people of Azotus arose the next day, behold, Dagon was lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord; so they took Dagon and put him back in his place.

(1 Samuel 5:4) 
And again, when they arose early on the next day, they found Dagon lying on the ground, face down before the Ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both of his hands were cut off, lying on the threshold. Only Dagon's torso remained intact.

(1 Samuel 5:5) 
Because of this, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Azotus do not step on Dagon's threshold, even to this day.

(1 Samuel 5:6) 
And the hand of the Lord grew heavy upon the people of Azotus; He utterly destroyed them, and struck them with tumors in their secret parts, both Azotus and its surrounding areas.

(1 Samuel 5:7) 
When the men of Azotus saw the plague, they said: "The Ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."

(1 Samuel 5:8) 
So they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said: "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" They answered: "Let the Ark of the God of Israel be carried to Geth." And so they carried the Ark of the God of Israel there.

(1 Samuel 5:9) 
And it came to pass, after they had carried it there, the hand of the Lord fell upon the city with a very great destruction; He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors erupted upon them in their secret parts.

(1 Samuel 5:10) 
So they sent the Ark of God to Accaron. When the Ark of God came to Accaron, the people of Accaron cried out, saying: "They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!"

(1 Samuel 5:11) 
Therefore, they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said: "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it may not kill us and our people." For there had been a deadly plague throughout the entire city, and a great terror; and the hand of God was exceedingly heavy upon them.

(1 Samuel 5:12) 
And those men who did not die were struck with tumors in their secret parts; and the cry of each city ascended even to the heavens.

(1 Samuel 6:1) 
The Ark of the Lord had remained in the land of the Philistines for seven months.

(1 Samuel 6:2) 
So the Philistines called for their priests and diviners, asking, 'What should we do with the Ark of the Lord? How can we send it back to its rightful place?'

(1 Samuel 6:3) 
They answered, 'If you are going to send back the Ark of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty. Instead, you must give Him a guilt offering for the sin you have committed. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not stopped punishing you.'

(1 Samuel 6:4) 
Then the Philistines asked, 'What sort of guilt offering should we return to Him?'

(1 Samuel 6:5) 
They replied, 'You must make five golden tumors, representing the plague’s effect, and five golden mice, according to the number of the Philistine rulers. This is because there was one plague afflicting all of you and your leaders.'

(1 Samuel 6:6) 
Why do you harden your hearts, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? After God struck them with plagues, did they not then let the Israelites go, and they departed?

(1 Samuel 6:7) 
Now then, make a new cart. Take two nursing cows that have never been yoked, and harness them to the cart. Shut up their calves at home, so they cannot follow their mothers.

(1 Samuel 6:8) 
Then take the Ark of the Lord and place it on the cart. Put the golden offerings, which you must return to Him for your sin, in a small box beside it. Then send the cart away and let it go where it may.

(1 Samuel 6:9) 
Watch closely: if it goes up the road towards Beth Shemesh, then it means He Himself has inflicted this great harm upon us. But if it does not, then we will know that His hand did not touch us, and it was merely an accident.

(1 Samuel 6:10) 
So the men did as they were told: they took two nursing cows and yoked them to the cart. Then they shut up their calves at home.

(1 Samuel 6:11) 
They then placed the Ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the small box containing the golden mice and the likenesses of the tumors.

(1 Samuel 6:12) 
The cows went straight along the road leading to Beth Shemesh, traveling directly without turning either to the right or to the left, all the while lowing in distress—a supernatural sign. The Philistine rulers followed them all the way to the borders of Beth Shemesh.

(1 Samuel 6:13) 
Now, the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping wheat in the valley. When they lifted their eyes and saw the Ark, they greatly rejoiced at the sight.

(1 Samuel 6:14) 
The cart came into the field of Joshua, a man from Beth Shemesh, and stopped there. There was a large stone in that place. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows upon it as a burnt offering to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 6:15) 
The Levites then took down the Ark of the Lord and the small box that was next to it, which contained the golden offerings. They placed these upon the large stone. The men of Beth Shemesh, for their part, offered burnt offerings and sacrificed other victims to the Lord on that day.

(1 Samuel 6:16) 
After witnessing all of this, the five Philistine rulers returned to Ekron that same day.

(1 Samuel 6:17) 
These are the golden tumors which the Philistines offered to the Lord as a guilt offering for their sin: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.

(1 Samuel 6:18) 
And there were golden mice matching the number of all the Philistine towns across the five territories, from the walled cities down to the smallest unwalled villages. This includes the great stone where they placed the Ark of the Lord, which is in the field of Joshua, a man from Beth Shemesh.

(1 Samuel 6:19) 
But the Lord struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked irreverently into the Ark of the Lord. He struck seventy men among the people, and fifty thousand of the common people. The people mourned greatly because the Lord had struck them with such a severe blow.

(1 Samuel 6:20) 
The men of Beth Shemesh asked, 'Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, the holy God? And to whom shall this Ark ascend from us now?' —meaning, 'Who can take it away from us?'

(1 Samuel 6:21) 
So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, 'The Philistines have brought back the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your city.'

(1 Samuel 6:1) 
The Ark of the Lord had been in the land of the Philistines for seven full days.

(1 Samuel 6:2) 
Then the Philistines summoned their priests and soothsayers, asking, 'What shall we do with the Ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its own place.'

(1 Samuel 6:3) 
They responded, 'If you return the Ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it back empty. Instead, you must give Him a guilt offering for the sin you have committed. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not stopped afflicting you.'

(1 Samuel 6:4) 
The Philistines asked them, 'What is the nature of the guilt offering we owe Him?' They answered, 'According to the number of the Philistine rulers, you must offer five golden tumors and five golden mice. This is because the same plague has afflicted all of you and your rulers.'

(1 Samuel 6:5) 
Therefore, you must make images resembling your tumors and images resembling the mice that have devastated your land. You must give glory to the God of Israel, hoping that He might lift His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.

(1 Samuel 6:6) 
Why would you harden your hearts, just as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? Was it not after He struck them that Pharaoh finally released the Israelites, and they departed?

(1 Samuel 6:7) 
So now, prepare a new cart, and harness two milk cows that have never worn a yoke to the cart. Then take their calves away from them and bring the calves back home.

(1 Samuel 6:8) 
Take the Ark of the Lord and place it on the cart. Put the golden offerings you have given Him as a guilt offering in a box beside it. Then release the cart and let it go on its own.

(1 Samuel 6:9) 
Watch closely: if the cart ascends along the road to Beth Shemesh by its own route, then He has indeed inflicted this great evil upon us. But if not, then we will know that His hand did not touch us, and this was merely a random misfortune.

(1 Samuel 6:10) 
So the men followed these instructions: they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, but they shut their calves back home.

(1 Samuel 6:11) 
They placed the Ark of God upon the cart, along with the box containing the golden mice and the images of the tumors.

(1 Samuel 6:12) 
The cows walked straight along the road toward Beth Shemesh, staying on a single path. They continued moo-ing as they went, turning neither to the right nor to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh.

(1 Samuel 6:13) 
Now, the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they lifted their eyes, they saw the Ark, and they rejoiced greatly at the sight.

(1 Samuel 6:14) 
The cart arrived in the field belonging to Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there. There was a large stone in that place. The people then chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord on the fire.

(1 Samuel 6:15) 
The Levites carefully took down the Ark of God, and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden vessels; and they placed them on that great stone. The men of Beth Shemesh then offered burnt offerings and sacrificed other sacrifices to the Lord on that day.

(1 Samuel 6:16) 
After seeing all of this, the five rulers of the Philistines returned to Ekron that same day.

(1 Samuel 6:17) 
These are the golden tumors that the Philistines rendered to the Lord as a guilt offering for their sin: one from Ashdod, one from Gaza, one from Ashkelon, one from Gath, and one from Ekron.

(1 Samuel 6:18) 
And the golden mice corresponded to the number of all the Philistine cities across their five provinces, from the fortified city to the unwalled village, right up to the great stone on which they placed the Ark of the Lord, which was in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.

(1 Samuel 6:19) 
But the Lord struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked inside the Ark of the Lord. He struck down seventy men from the people, and fifty thousand of the common folk. The people mourned greatly because the Lord had afflicted them with such a severe plague.

(1 Samuel 6:20) 
The men of Beth Shemesh said, 'Who can stand in the presence of this holy Lord God? And to whom will He go up from us?'

(1 Samuel 6:21) 
So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, 'The Philistines have returned the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it back to your own place.'

(1 Samuel 7:1) 
So the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and they brought the Ark of the Lord there. They brought it into Abinadab's house, which was on the hill. Then they consecrated Abinadab's son, Eleazar, for the sacred duty of guarding the Ark of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 7:2) 
And it came to pass that from the day the Ark of the Lord remained in Kiriath-jearim, many days accumulated, and twenty full years passed by. And all the house of Israel then turned back to the Lord, seeking His rest and favor.

(1 Samuel 7:3) 
Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: 'If you are truly returning to the Lord with all your heart, then you must remove all foreign gods and the goddesses of Astarte from your midst. Prepare your hearts solely for the Lord and serve Him alone. If you do this, He will deliver you from the power of the Philistines.'

(1 Samuel 7:4) 
So the sons of Israel removed the Baalim and the Astartes, and they served the Lord alone.

(1 Samuel 7:5) 
Then Samuel said: 'Gather all of Israel at Mizpah, so that I may pray to the Lord for you there.'

(1 Samuel 7:6) 
So they gathered at Mizpah, and they drew water and poured it out before the Lord, performing a symbolic act of pouring out their hearts. They also fasted on that day, and there they confessed, saying, 'We have sinned against the Lord.' And Samuel acted as a judge for the sons of Israel in Mizpah, hearing their disputes and providing guidance.

(1 Samuel 7:7) 
Now the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, so the princes of the Philistines went up against Israel to attack them. When the sons of Israel heard this, they were terrified of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 7:8) 
And they said to Samuel, 'Do not cease to cry out for us to the Lord our God, that He may save us from the power of the Philistines.'

(1 Samuel 7:9) 
So Samuel took one suckling lamb, and he offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. And Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord heard him, granting his prayer.

(1 Samuel 7:10) 
It came to pass, therefore, as Samuel was offering the burnt offering, that the Philistines advanced to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered with a great voice over the Philistines on that very day, and He threw them into confusion, and they were struck down by the sons of Israel.

(1 Samuel 7:11) 
And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah, pursued the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to the place below Beth-car.

(1 Samuel 7:12) 
Then Samuel took one stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He called the name of that place 'Stone of Help,' saying, 'Up to this point, the Lord has helped us.'

(1 Samuel 7:13) 
So the Philistines were humbled; they no longer entered the territory of Israel. Thus, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel, holding them back and defeating them.

(1 Samuel 7:14) 
And the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron as far as Gath, including all their surrounding territories. Thus, Israel was delivered from the power of the Philistines. There was also peace established between Israel and the Amorites, their other neighbors.

(1 Samuel 7:15) 
Samuel continued to judge Israel throughout all the days of his life,

(1 Samuel 7:16) 
and each year he would go on a circuit, visiting Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. In these aforementioned places, he would judge Israel, addressing their legal and spiritual needs.

(1 Samuel 7:17) 
He would then return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there he also judged Israel. And, in Ramah, he built an altar to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 7:1) 
Therefore, the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and they brought the ark of the Lord. They carried it into the house of Abinadab, which was situated on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 7:2) 
From the day that the ark of the Lord remained in Kiriath-jearim, many days passed—twenty years had already gone by. And all the house of Israel turned their hearts toward the Lord for guidance and peace.

(1 Samuel 7:3) 
Samuel then said to all the house of Israel: 'If you truly return to the Lord with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods from your midst, and take away the idols of Astaroth from your lands. Prepare your hearts solely for the Lord and serve Him alone, and He will deliver you from the power of the Philistines.'

(1 Samuel 7:4) 
So the sons of Israel put away the idols of Baal and Astaroth, and they served the Lord alone.

(1 Samuel 7:5) 
Samuel then said, 'Gather all of yourselves at Mizpah, so that I may pray to the Lord on your behalf.'

(1 Samuel 7:6) 
So they gathered at Mizpah. They drew water and poured it out before the Lord as a sign of their repentance, and they fasted on that day. And they confessed there, saying, 'We have sinned against the Lord.' And Samuel presided over the sons of Israel in judgment at Mizpah, guiding them in justice and righteousness.

(1 Samuel 7:7) 
Now, the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel were gathered at Mizpah, and the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack Israel. When the sons of Israel heard this, they became very afraid at the approach of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 7:8) 
And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, 'Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God on our behalf, that He may save us from the power of the Philistines!'

(1 Samuel 7:9) 
Then Samuel took a single suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering, completely consumed, to the Lord. And Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord heard his prayer.

(1 Samuel 7:10) 
Now, as Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines pressed hard in battle against Israel. But on that very day, the Lord thundered with a mighty voice over the Philistines. They were thrown into utter confusion and were struck down by the sons of Israel.

(1 Samuel 7:11) 
So the sons of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines. They struck them down all the way to the place just below Beth-car.

(1 Samuel 7:12) 
Then Samuel took a single stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named that place 'The Stone of Help.' He declared, 'Up to this very moment, the Lord has continually helped us!'

(1 Samuel 7:13) 
Thus, the Philistines were completely humbled and no longer ventured into the territories of Israel. Indeed, the mighty hand of the Lord was against the Philistines throughout all the days that Samuel lived.

(1 Samuel 7:14) 
Furthermore, the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel, from Ekron to Gath, along with their surrounding lands, were all restored to Israel. And Israel was delivered from the power of the Philistines. Peace was also established between Israel and the Amorites.

(1 Samuel 7:15) 
And Samuel continued to judge and guide Israel throughout all the days of his life.

(1 Samuel 7:16) 
Year after year, he would travel in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he would judge Israel in those same places.

(1 Samuel 7:17) 
Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there. And there he also judged Israel, and he built an altar there dedicated to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 8:1) 
Now it came to pass that when Samuel became old, he then appointed his own sons to be judges over the people of Israel.

(1 Samuel 8:2) 
And the name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abia. These two were judges in Bersabee.

(1 Samuel 8:3) 
But his sons did not walk in Samuel's ways of righteous judgment. Instead, they turned aside after greed, accepting bribes and perverting justice.

(1 Samuel 8:4) 
Therefore, all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel in Rama.

(1 Samuel 8:5) 
And they said to him: "Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now therefore, appoint for us a king to govern us, just as all the nations around us have kings."

(1 Samuel 8:6) 
This word displeased Samuel, because they had said: "Give us a king to govern us." And Samuel prayed to the Lord about this matter.

(1 Samuel 8:7) 
Then the Lord said to Samuel: "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you as their leader; rather, they have rejected Me, so that I should not reign over them as their true King."

(1 Samuel 8:8) 
According to all their works which they have done, from the day I brought them out of Egypt even to this very day— just as they have forsaken Me and served other gods— so also are they doing to you, My servant Samuel.

(1 Samuel 8:9) 
Now therefore, listen to their voice. Nevertheless, solemnly warn them, and declare to them the rights of the king who shall reign over them.

(1 Samuel 8:10) 
So Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king.

(1 Samuel 8:11) 
And he said: "This will be the nature of the king who is to reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his chariots and make them his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots as heralds."

(1 Samuel 8:12) 
And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and those to plow his fields and to reap his harvests, and to make his instruments of war and his chariots.

(1 Samuel 8:13) 
He will also take your daughters and make them perfumers, and cooks, and bakers for his royal household.

(1 Samuel 8:14) 
He will take your best fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.

(1 Samuel 8:15) 
He will also take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, to give to his eunuchs and his servants.

(1 Samuel 8:16) 
He will take your male and female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his own work.

(1 Samuel 8:17) 
He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants, serving him directly.

(1 Samuel 8:18) 
And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you have asked for a king for yourselves.

(1 Samuel 8:19) 
But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel. Instead, they said: "No, this is not so; but a king shall be over us!"

(1 Samuel 8:20) 
They continued: "And we will be like all the other nations, and our king will judge us, and he will go out before us and fight our battles for us."

(1 Samuel 8:21) 
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them in the ears of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 8:22) 
And the Lord said to Samuel: "Listen to their voice and appoint a king over them." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel: "Each man among you, return to his own city." This was to prepare for the selection of the king.

(1 Samuel 8:1) 
Now it happened that when Samuel had grown old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.

(1 Samuel 8:2) 
His firstborn son was named Joel, and his second son was named Abiah. They were serving as judges in Beersheba.

(1 Samuel 8:3) 
But his sons did not follow his ways. Instead, they turned to pursue greed, accepted bribes, and twisted justice.

(1 Samuel 8:4) 
Therefore, all the elders of Israel gathered and came to Samuel in Ramah.

(1 Samuel 8:5) 
And they said to him: 'Look, you have grown old, and your sons are not following your example. So now, appoint a king for us to govern us, just as all the other nations have.'

(1 Samuel 8:6) 
This request displeased Samuel because they had said, 'Give us a king to govern us.' So Samuel prayed to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 8:7) 
But the Lord said to Samuel: 'Listen to everything the people are telling you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being their King.'

(1 Samuel 8:8) 
Just as they have done all their evil deeds from the day I brought them out of Egypt until this very day—forsaking Me and serving foreign gods—so they are doing to you now.

(1 Samuel 8:9) 
So now, listen to what they say. But solemnly warn them and tell them about the ways of the king who will reign over them.

(1 Samuel 8:10) 
So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king.

(1 Samuel 8:11) 
And he said: 'This will be the manner of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots, making them his horsemen and his runners to go before his chariots.'

(1 Samuel 8:12) 
He will also appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties. He will make your sons his field workers, to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons and chariots.

(1 Samuel 8:13) 
He will also take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers for him.

(1 Samuel 8:14) 
He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his own servants.

(1 Samuel 8:15) 
He will also take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards to give to his officials and servants.

(1 Samuel 8:16) 
He will take your male servants and female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and use them for his own work.

(1 Samuel 8:17) 
He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.

(1 Samuel 8:18) 
And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.

(1 Samuel 8:19) 
But the people refused to listen to Samuel. They said: 'Absolutely not! There must be a king over us.'

(1 Samuel 8:20) 
We want to be like all the other nations. Our king will govern us, he will go out before us, and he will fight our battles for us.

(1 Samuel 8:21) 
Samuel heard all the words of the people and reported them to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 8:22) 
Then the Lord said to Samuel: 'Listen to what they say, and appoint a king over them.' So Samuel said to the men of Israel: 'Everyone may now return home to his own city.'

(1 Samuel 8:23) 
Now there was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah. He was a mighty man of valor from Benjamin.

(1 Samuel 8:24) 
He had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no man among the Israelites more handsome than he; he stood a head taller than any of the people.

(1 Samuel 8:25) 
Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had gone astray. So Kish said to Saul his son: 'Take one of the servants with you, go and search for the donkeys.'

(1 Samuel 8:26) 
They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, then through the land of Shalishah, but they found nothing. Next, they passed through the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, and found nothing.

(1 Samuel 8:27) 
When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him: 'Come, let us turn back, lest my father, having stopped worrying about the donkeys, should now become anxious about us.'

(1 Samuel 8:28) 
The servant replied: 'Look, there is a man of God in this city, a very respected man. Everything he says certainly comes true. So now, let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us where to go to find what we came for.'

(1 Samuel 8:29) 
Saul then said to his servant: 'But if we go, what can we give the man of God? We have run out of bread in our bags, and we have no present to give to the man of God. We have nothing at all.'

(1 Samuel 8:30) 
Again, the servant answered Saul and said: 'Look, I happen to have a fourth of a shekel of silver with me. Let’s give that to the man of God so he can tell us where to go.'

(1 Samuel 8:31) 
This is how people used to speak in Israel: when someone went to inquire of God, they would say, 'Come, let us go to the seer.' For the one who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.

(1 Samuel 8:32) 
Saul then said to his servant: 'That’s a good idea; come, let us go.' So they went to the city where the man of God was.

(1 Samuel 8:33) 
As they were going up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them: 'Is the seer here?'

(1 Samuel 8:34) 
They answered them: 'Yes, he is right ahead of you. Hurry now! He came to the city today because there is a sacrifice for the people on the high place.'

(1 Samuel 8:35) 
As soon as he arrives, the people will eat. For they do not eat until he comes and blesses the sacrifice, and then those who are invited eat. So go up now, because today you will find him.

(1 Samuel 8:36) 
So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, Samuel was coming out to meet them, on his way up to the high place.

(1 Samuel 8:37) 
Now the Lord had secretly informed Samuel the day before Saul came, saying:

(1 Samuel 8:38) 
About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be commander over My people Israel. He will save My people from the power of the Philistines, for I have seen My people’s affliction, and their cry has reached Me.

(1 Samuel 8:39) 
When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him: 'There is the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.'

(1 Samuel 8:40) 
Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said: 'Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?'

(1 Samuel 9:1) 
There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Kish. He was the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Bechorath, who was the son of Aphiah. Kish was also the son of a certain Benjamite man who was mighty in strength.

(1 Samuel 9:2) 
Kish had a son whose name was Saul. Saul was an excellent and good man, and there was no one among the sons of Israel more handsome than him. From his shoulders upwards, he was taller than all the people.

(1 Samuel 9:3) 
However, some of the donkeys belonging to Kish, Saul's father, had wandered off and were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul: 'Take one of the young servants with you, go out, and search for the donkeys.'

(1 Samuel 9:4) 
They traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, and then through the land of Shalisha, but they didn't find the donkeys there. They then crossed through the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there either. Next, they went through the land of Benjamin itself, but they found nothing.

(1 Samuel 9:5) 
When they arrived in the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him: 'Come, let's go back now.' 'Otherwise, my father might stop worrying about the lost donkeys and start worrying about us instead.'

(1 Samuel 9:6) 
The servant answered him: 'Look, there's a man of God in this city. He is a very respected prophet.' 'Everything he says comes true, exactly as he says it.' 'Let's go there now; perhaps he can tell us about our journey and where to find the donkeys.'

(1 Samuel 9:7) 
Saul then said to his servant: 'But if we go, what can we give the man?' 'We've run out of bread in our bags, and we have no small gift to offer to this man of God.' 'We don't have anything at all left.'

(1 Samuel 9:8) 
The servant replied to Saul again and said: 'Look, I have a quarter of a shekel of silver with me.' 'I can give that to the man of God so he can tell us where to go.'

(1 Samuel 9:9) 
In earlier times, this was the custom in Israel: when people went to consult God, they would say: 'Come, let's go to the seer.' This is because the one who is called a 'prophet' today was formerly called a 'seer'.

(1 Samuel 9:10) 
Saul said to his servant: 'Your suggestion is an excellent one. Come, let's go.' So they went to the city where the man of God was living.

(1 Samuel 9:11) 
As they were climbing the hill leading up to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water. Saul and his servant asked them: 'Is the seer here in this place?'

(1 Samuel 9:12) 
The young women answered them: 'Yes, he is! He's just ahead of you.' 'Hurry now, because today the people are making a sacrifice at the high place, and he will be there.'

(1 Samuel 9:13) 
As soon as you enter the city, you will find him at once, before he goes up to the high place to eat the sacrificial meal. The people will not eat until he arrives and blesses the sacrifice. Only then will those who have been invited to the feast eat. So go up now, because you will certainly find him today.

(1 Samuel 9:14) 
So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, behold, Samuel was coming out to meet them on his way to the high place.

(1 Samuel 9:15) 
Now, the Lord had revealed a message to Samuel just one day before Saul arrived, saying:

(1 Samuel 9:16) 
'At this very time tomorrow, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin.' 'You are to anoint him as the chosen leader over My people, Israel.' 'He himself will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines, because I have looked upon My people's suffering, and their cry for help has reached Me.'

(1 Samuel 9:17) 
When Samuel saw Saul approaching, the Lord said to him: 'Behold the man of whom I spoke to you!' 'This is the one who will rule over My people, Israel.'

(1 Samuel 9:18) 
Saul then approached Samuel, right in the middle of the city gate, and asked: 'Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?'

(1 Samuel 9:19) 
Samuel answered Saul, saying: 'I am the seer you are looking for!' 'Go up ahead of me to the high place so you can eat the sacrificial meal with me today.' 'I will send you on your way tomorrow morning, and I will reveal to you everything that is on your heart—the things you are concerned about.'

(1 Samuel 9:20) 
And as for the donkeys you lost three days ago, don't worry about them, because they have already been found. Now, to whom will all the best things of Israel belong in the future? Is it not to you and to all the household of your father?

(1 Samuel 9:21) 
Saul answered, saying: 'Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe in Israel?' 'And is not my family the least significant among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?' 'Why, then, do you speak such words to me, suggesting I am worthy of such honor?'

(1 Samuel 9:22) 
Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and led them into the banquet hall. He gave them the most honored place among all those who had been invited to the feast, which included about thirty men.

(1 Samuel 9:23) 
Samuel then said to the cook: 'Bring the portion of the meat that I specifically told you to set aside separately.'

(1 Samuel 9:24) 
So the cook brought the choice cut—a leg or shoulder portion—and placed it before Saul. Samuel said: 'Look, this is what was reserved. Set it before you and eat, for it was intentionally kept for you when I invited the people to this sacrificial meal.' So Saul ate with Samuel on that day.

(1 Samuel 9:25) 
Afterward, they came down from the high place into the town, and Samuel spoke with Saul on the rooftop of his house.

(1 Samuel 9:26) 
They rose very early in the morning, and as the sun began to rise, Samuel called to Saul on the rooftop, saying: 'Get up now, so I can send you on your way.' Saul then rose, and both he and Samuel went outside the city.

(1 Samuel 9:27) 
As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul: 'Tell your servant to go on ahead of us.' 'But you, stand still for a little while, so I can reveal to you the word of the Lord.'

(1 Samuel 10:1) 
Samuel took a small flask of oil and poured it over Saul’s head. He then kissed Saul, showing his acceptance and loyalty. Samuel said to Saul: "See, the Lord has anointed you—this means you are chosen and set apart—to be a prince over His inheritance, which is the nation of Israel."

(1 Samuel 10:2) 
As soon as you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb—which is located in the southern part of Benjamin’s territory. They will tell you: 'The donkeys you went searching for have been found.' And then they will add: 'Look, your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and is now anxious about you all, saying: "What should I do about my son?"'

(1 Samuel 10:3) 
When you leave that place and travel a bit further, you will arrive at the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there, on their way to worship God in Bethel. Two of them will be carrying young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and another will be carrying a flask of wine.

(1 Samuel 10:4) 
They will greet you, and then they will offer you two loaves of bread, which you must accept from their hands.

(1 Samuel 10:5) 
After this, you will come to the hill of God—a place where the Lord is worshipped. There is a Philistine garrison stationed there. When you enter the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place of worship. They will have a psaltery, a drum, a flute, and a harp playing before them, and they will be prophesying—meaning they will be in a state of inspired worship, singing, and possibly speaking under divine influence.

(1 Samuel 10:6) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord will powerfully rush upon you. You will prophesy with them, and you will be completely changed into a different kind of man—one fit for the role of king.

(1 Samuel 10:7) 
So when all these signs come to pass for you, act decisively and do whatever you find necessary to do, because the Lord is with you.

(1 Samuel 10:8) 
Then you will go down to Gilgal before me—for I will indeed come down to meet you there—so that you may offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You must wait for seven days until I come to you, and then I will show you what you are to do.

(1 Samuel 10:9) 
So when Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave him a new heart—a changed inner disposition suitable for his new calling. And all these signs Samuel foretold came to pass on that very day.

(1 Samuel 10:10) 
When Saul and his servant arrived at the hill, suddenly a company of prophets met him. The Spirit of the Lord powerfully rushed upon him, and he began to prophesy among them.

(1 Samuel 10:11) 
All who had known Saul previously, recently or in the past, heard that he was prophesying with the prophets, and they said to one another in surprise: "What has happened to Kish’s son? Is Saul also among the prophets now?"

(1 Samuel 10:12) 
Then one from the crowd answered and said, understanding the spiritual source of prophecy: "And who is the father of all prophets but God?" For this reason, it became a common proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

(1 Samuel 10:13) 
When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place of worship.

(1 Samuel 10:14) 
Saul's uncle then asked him and his servant: "Where did you go?" They answered: "We were looking for the donkeys. When we couldn't find them, we came to Samuel."

(1 Samuel 10:15) 
Saul’s uncle said: "Tell me, what did Samuel say to you?"

(1 Samuel 10:16) 
Saul replied to his uncle: "He merely told us that the donkeys had been found." But concerning the matter of the kingship, which Samuel had discussed with him, Saul did not tell his uncle anything.

(1 Samuel 10:17) 
Then Samuel summoned all the people of Israel to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah.

(1 Samuel 10:18) 
And he said to the children of Israel: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'I myself brought Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms and those who oppressed you.'"

(1 Samuel 10:19) 
"But today you have rejected your God—the very One who alone has saved you from all your troubles and distresses. Instead, you have said: 'No, we insist, set a king over us.' Therefore, now present yourselves before the Lord, arranged by your tribes and by your family units."

(1 Samuel 10:20) 
So Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and by the casting of lots, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.

(1 Samuel 10:21) 
Then Samuel brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the lot fell on the Matrite family. Finally, by lot, Saul, the son of Kish, was chosen. But when they looked for him, he could not be found.

(1 Samuel 10:22) 
So they further inquired of the Lord: "Will the man indeed come forward here?" The Lord answered: "Look, he is hiding among the baggage."

(1 Samuel 10:23) 
So they ran and brought him out from there. When Saul stood among the people, he was taller than everyone else, from the shoulder upward, an imposing figure.

(1 Samuel 10:24) 
Then Samuel said to all the people: "Do you not see the one whom the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people!" And all the people shouted with great acclaim, saying: "Long live the King!"

(1 Samuel 10:25) 
Then Samuel spoke to the people about the rights and duties of the kingship, which he then wrote in a book and laid up before the Lord as a permanent record. After this, Samuel sent all the people away, each person returning to their own home.

(1 Samuel 10:26) 
Saul also went home to Gibeah, and a company of men whose hearts God had touched went with him, becoming his loyal followers.

(1 Samuel 10:27) 
But some worthless men—called "sons of Belial"—said: "How can this man save us?" They despised him and did not bring him customary gifts to honor him as king. However, Saul wisely pretended not to hear their insults.

(1 Samuel 10:1) 
Then Samuel took a small flask of oil, poured it over Saul's head, and then kissed him, saying: "Look, the Lord has anointed you as prince over His own people, His inheritance."

(1 Samuel 10:2) 
When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, in the territory of Benjamin, towards the south. They will say to you: 'The donkeys you went to search for have been found.' And behold, your father has found the donkeys, and he is worried about you both, and has stopped thinking about the donkeys.

(1 Samuel 10:3) 
And when you have gone on from there, and passed further, and come to the oak of Tabor, three men will meet you there, going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three young goats, another, three loaves of bread, and another, a flask of wine.

(1 Samuel 10:4) 
They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, and you shall take them from their hand.

(1 Samuel 10:5) 
After this, you will come to the hill of God, where the Philistine garrison is located. And when you enter the city there, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. Before them will be a psaltery, a drum, a flute, and a lyre, and they themselves will be prophesying.

(1 Samuel 10:6) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them, and you will be changed into another man.

(1 Samuel 10:7) 
Therefore, when these signs come to pass for you, do whatever your hand finds to do, because the Lord is with you.

(1 Samuel 10:8) 
And you shall go down before me to Gilgal — for I myself will come down to you there — and you shall offer burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace offerings. You shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and I will show you what to do.

(1 Samuel 10:9) 
So when he turned his back on him to depart, God changed his heart for him; and all these signs came to pass on that day.

(1 Samuel 10:10) 
And they came to the hill, and behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he prophesied in their midst.

(1 Samuel 10:11) 
All who knew him previously — for a long time — heard that he had prophesied with the prophets, and they said to one another: 'What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?'

(1 Samuel 10:12) 
And one of the crowd responded, saying: 'And who is *their* father then?' — meaning, who are *those* prophets' fathers, that they should be prophets? — For this reason, it became a common saying: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'

(1 Samuel 10:13) 
And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.

(1 Samuel 10:14) 
Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant boy: 'Where did you go?' They answered: 'To look for the donkeys. And when we couldn't find them, we came to Samuel.'

(1 Samuel 10:15) 
And Saul’s uncle said: 'Tell me what Samuel said to you.'

(1 Samuel 10:16) 
And Saul said to his uncle: 'He told us that the donkeys had been found.' But concerning the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said to him.

(1 Samuel 10:17) 
Then Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah.

(1 Samuel 10:18) 
And he said to the children of Israel: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'

(1 Samuel 10:19) 
'But today you have rejected your God, who alone saved you from all your troubles and distresses. And you have said: "No, but set a king over us!" Now therefore, present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.'

(1 Samuel 10:20) 
So Samuel brought forward all the tribes of Israel, and the lot fell to the tribe of Benjamin.

(1 Samuel 10:21) 
Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the lot fell to the clan of Matri. And it came down to Saul, the son of Kish. But they searched for him, and he could not be found.

(1 Samuel 10:22) 
So they inquired further of the Lord, asking if the man had come there. And the Lord answered: 'Behold, he is hidden among the baggage.'

(1 Samuel 10:23) 
So they ran and brought him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.

(1 Samuel 10:24) 
And Samuel said to all the people: 'Do you see whom the Lord has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?' Then all the people shouted and said: 'Long live the King!'

(1 Samuel 10:25) 
Then Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of the kingdom, and he wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his own home.

(1 Samuel 10:26) 
But Saul also went home to Gibeah; and with him went valiant men, whose hearts God had touched.

(1 Samuel 10:27) 
However, some wicked men said: 'How can this man save us?' And they despised him and brought him no presents. But he pretended not to hear.

(1 Samuel 11:1) 
Nahash the Ammonite advanced and began to fight against Jabesh Gilead. Then all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash: "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."

(1 Samuel 11:2) 
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them: "I will make this covenant with you, but only if I may gouge out all of your right eyes, and make you a public disgrace in all of Israel."

(1 Samuel 11:3) 
And the elders of Jabesh said to him: "Give us seven days so that we may send messengers throughout all the borders of Israel. And if there is no one who can defend us, then we will surrender to you."

(1 Samuel 11:4) 
So the messengers came to Gibeah, the city of Saul, and spoke these words in the hearing of the people. And all the people raised their voice and wept.

(1 Samuel 11:5) 
And behold, Saul was coming, following his oxen from the field. And he said: "What troubles the people, that they weep?" And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.

(1 Samuel 11:6) 
And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger burned fiercely.

(1 Samuel 11:7) 
And he took a pair of oxen and cut them into pieces, then sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying: "Whoever does not come out and follow Saul and Samuel, the same will be done to his oxen." And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.

(1 Samuel 11:8) 
And he counted them at Bezek. And the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand men, but the men of Judah were thirty thousand.

(1 Samuel 11:9) 
And they said to the messengers who had come: "Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow, deliverance will be yours when the sun grows hot'"—meaning, after the morning attack. So the messengers came and announced it to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.

(1 Samuel 11:10) 
And the men of Jabesh said: "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."

(1 Samuel 11:11) 
And it happened on the next day: Saul divided the people into three companies, and they entered the midst of the Ammonite camp during the morning watch, and struck down the Ammonites until the day grew hot. But the remaining Ammonites were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.

(1 Samuel 11:12) 
And the people said to Samuel: "Who is this who said: 'Saul shall not reign over us?' Give us those men, and we will put them to death."

(1 Samuel 11:13) 
And Saul said: "No man shall be put to death this day, because today the Lord has worked deliverance in Israel."

(1 Samuel 11:14) 
Then Samuel said to the people: "Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and there let us renew the kingdom."

(1 Samuel 11:15) 
And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they anointed Saul as king before the Lord in Gilgal. And there they offered peace offerings before the Lord. And Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced there exceedingly.

(1 Samuel 11:1) 
Nahash the Ammonite marched up and began to fight against Jabesh-Gilead. All the men of Jabesh then said to Nahash: 'Make a covenant with us, and we will be your servants.'

(1 Samuel 11:2) 
Nahash the Ammonite answered them: 'I will make this covenant with you only on the condition that I gouge out every one of your right eyes, and so make you a disgrace throughout all of Israel.'

(1 Samuel 11:3) 
The elders of Jabesh then said to Nahash: 'Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout all the territories of Israel. If no one comes to defend us, then we will surrender to you.'

(1 Samuel 11:4) 
So the messengers came to Gibeah, Saul's city, and spoke these words in the hearing of the people. And all the people raised their voices and wept aloud because of the impending threat.

(1 Samuel 11:5) 
And behold, Saul was coming back, following his oxen from the field. Saul asked: 'What troubles the people that they are weeping?' And they recounted to him the words of the messengers from Jabesh.

(1 Samuel 11:6) 
Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Saul when he heard these words, and his righteous anger burned fiercely.

(1 Samuel 11:7) 
And he took a yoke of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them throughout all the territories of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying: 'Whoever does not come out and follow Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!' Then the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they came out as one unified force.

(1 Samuel 11:8) 
And he mustered them at Bezek. There were three hundred thousand men from the northern tribes of Israel, and thirty thousand men from the tribe of Judah.

(1 Samuel 11:9) 
And they said to the messengers who had come: 'Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: "Tomorrow, when the sun grows hot, you will have deliverance and safety."' So the messengers came and reported this to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced greatly.

(1 Samuel 11:10) 
Then the men of Jabesh said to the Ammonites, misleading them: 'Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever you please.'

(1 Samuel 11:11) 
And it came to pass on the next day: Saul arranged his army into three companies. They entered the middle of the Ammonite camp during the morning watch—the time just before dawn—and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who remained alive were so thoroughly scattered that not even two of them were left together.

(1 Samuel 11:12) 
Then the people, emboldened by victory, said to Samuel: 'Who is it that said, "Saul shall not reign over us"? Hand them over to us, and we will put them to death!'

(1 Samuel 11:13) 
But Saul, in his triumph, said: 'No man shall be put to death this day, for today the Lord has brought about this great deliverance and salvation for Israel.'

(1 Samuel 11:14) 
Then Samuel said to the people: 'Come, let us go to Gilgal, a place of historical significance, and there let us publicly affirm the kingship.'

(1 Samuel 11:15) 
So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they formally anointed Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal. And there they offered peace offerings before the Lord, a sign of their renewed covenant. Saul rejoiced there, and all the men of Israel rejoiced with him exceedingly.

(1 Samuel 12:1) 
Samuel then addressed all of the people of Israel. He told them: 'I have heard all that you have asked me for, and I have set a king over you.'

(1 Samuel 12:2) 
'And now the king leads you. As for me, I have grown old and grey, but my sons are still among you. I have lived my life among you, from my youth until this very day.'

(1 Samuel 12:3) 
'Speak about me now before the Lord and before His anointed one, the king. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey? Have I ever defrauded anyone or oppressed them? Have I ever taken a bribe from anyone and then ignored their case? If so, tell me, and I will restore it to you today.'

(1 Samuel 12:4) 
They all replied: 'You have not defrauded us, nor have you oppressed us, nor have you taken anything from anyone's hand!'

(1 Samuel 12:5) 
Then Samuel said to them: 'The Lord is a witness against you, and His anointed one is a witness today, that you have found nothing wrong in my conduct.' And they said: 'He is a witness!'

(1 Samuel 12:6) 
Samuel then said to the people: 'The Lord, who made Moses and Aaron into leaders, is the same God who led our ancestors out of the land of Egypt.'

(1 Samuel 12:7) 
'Therefore, stand now, so that I may contend with you in judgment before the Lord, concerning all the gracious deeds which the Lord performed for you and for your ancestors.'

(1 Samuel 12:8) 
'Remember how Jacob went down into Egypt, and your ancestors cried out to the Lord? And the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and they led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.'

(1 Samuel 12:9) 
'But then they forgot the Lord their God. So He handed them over into the power of Sisara, the commander of the army of Hasor, and into the power of the Philistines, and into the power of the king of Moab, and these nations fought against them.'

(1 Samuel 12:10) 
'Then your ancestors cried out to the Lord, saying: "We have sinned, for we have abandoned the Lord and served the Baalim and the Astaroth. Now therefore, deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You!"'

(1 Samuel 12:11) 
'So the Lord sent Jerobaal, and Badan, and Jephte, and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived in security.'

(1 Samuel 12:12) 
'But when you saw that Naas, the king of the children of Ammon, was coming against you, you said to me: "No, we must have a king reign over us!" You said this even though the Lord your God was already your King!'

(1 Samuel 12:13) 
'Now therefore, behold your king, whom you have chosen and for whom you have asked. Behold, the Lord has set a king over you.'

(1 Samuel 12:14) 
'If you fear the Lord, and serve Him, and listen to His voice, and do not rebel against the command of the Lord, then both you and your king who rules over you will follow the Lord your God.'

(1 Samuel 12:15) 
'But if you do not listen to the voice of the Lord, and if you rebel against the words of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your ancestors —meaning the previous generation of kings and leaders.'

(1 Samuel 12:16) 
'But now, stand still and see this great thing which the Lord is about to do before your eyes.'

(1 Samuel 12:17) 
'Is it not the time of the wheat harvest today? This is a time of year when it does not rain. I will call upon the Lord, and He will send thunder and rain. And you will know and see that you have done great evil in the sight of the Lord by asking for a king for yourselves.'

(1 Samuel 12:18) 
So Samuel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain on that very day. And all the people feared the Lord and Samuel greatly.

(1 Samuel 12:19) 
And all the people said to Samuel: 'Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, so that we may not die! For we have added to all our other sins this evil, that we asked for a king for ourselves.'

(1 Samuel 12:20) 
Samuel then said to the people: 'Do not be afraid! You have indeed done all this evil, but nevertheless, do not turn away from following the Lord. Instead, serve the Lord with all your heart.'

(1 Samuel 12:21) 
'And do not turn aside after empty things, which will not profit you nor deliver you, for they are empty idols.'

(1 Samuel 12:22) 
'For the Lord will not forsake His people for His great Name's sake. This is because the Lord has sworn to make you His own people.'

(1 Samuel 12:23) 
'Far be it from me to commit this sin against the Lord, that I should cease to pray for you! And I will teach you the good and the right way.'

(1 Samuel 12:24) 
'Therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in truth and with all your heart. For you have seen how many great things He has done for you.'

(1 Samuel 12:25) 
'But if you continue in wickedness, both you and your king will perish together.'

(1 Samuel 13:1) 
Saul was in the first year of his effective reign when he began to rule, and he reigned for two years.

(1 Samuel 13:2) 
And Saul chose for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of them were with Saul in Machmas and in the mountains of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin. The rest of the people, he sent each man back to his own tent.

(1 Samuel 13:3) 
And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Gabaa. When the Philistines heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet throughout all the land, saying: "Let the Hebrews hear this!"

(1 Samuel 13:4) 
And all Israel heard such a report: "Saul has struck the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel has aroused the hatred of the Philistines." So the people were summoned to Saul in Galgala.

(1 Samuel 13:5) 
Furthermore, the Philistines gathered to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand cavalry, and the rest of their common people were as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and encamped in Machmas, to the east of Bethaven.

(1 Samuel 13:6) 
However, when the men of Israel saw that they were hard-pressed, and that the people were in distress, they hid themselves in caves, and in dense thickets, and among the rocks, and in hidden places, and in cisterns.

(1 Samuel 13:7) 
Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad. While Saul was still in Galgala, all the people trembled in fear, following him.

(1 Samuel 13:8) 
And Saul waited for seven days, according to the appointed time Samuel had established. But Samuel did not come to Galgala, and the people began to scatter from him.

(1 Samuel 13:9) 
Therefore, Saul said: "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.

(1 Samuel 13:10) 
When he had just finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel was coming. And Saul went out to meet him to greet him.

(1 Samuel 13:11) 
And Samuel said to him: "What have you done?" Saul answered: "Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and you had not come according to the appointed days, and the Philistines had gathered in Machmas,

(1 Samuel 13:12) 
I said to myself: 'Now the Philistines will come down against me in Galgala, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord through prayer and sacrifice.' Therefore, I dared to transgress and offered the sacrifice."

(1 Samuel 13:13) 
And Samuel said to Saul: "You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the commandments of the Lord your God, which He commanded you. For if you had not done this, the Lord would now have established your kingdom over Israel forever.

(1 Samuel 13:14) 
But now, your kingdom will not last. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him to be a leader over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded."

(1 Samuel 13:15) 
And Samuel rose up and went from Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, who was meeting with the people that remained from among the strongest men.

(1 Samuel 13:16) 
And Saul numbered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.

(1 Samuel 13:17) 
And a company of the Philistines went up to pass through the pass of Machmas.

(1 Samuel 13:18) 
Now one part of them was in Bethoron, and another went to Ephra into the land of Sual, and the third went on towards the boundary above the valley of Oheb.

(1 Samuel 13:19) 
There was not a single blacksmith to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had ensured that the Hebrews would not be able to make a sword or a spear.

(1 Samuel 13:20) 
Instead, all the men of Israel had to go down to the Philistines, so that each man could sharpen his plowshare, and his mattock, and his axe, and his hoe.

(1 Samuel 13:21) 
And the edges of their plowshares, and mattocks, and three-pronged spears, and axes were dull. And they were sharpened by the Philistines' oxen goads.

(1 Samuel 13:22) 
And when the day of battle arrived, no sword or spear was found in the hand of all the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, except for Saul and his son Jonathan.

(1 Samuel 13:23) 
Now a garrison of the Philistines went out to cross over to Madian.

(1 Samuel 14:1) 
Some days later, it happened that Jonathan, son of Saul, said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost that is across the valley." Jonathan, however, did not wish to tell his father about this plan.

(1 Samuel 14:2) 
Meanwhile, Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah, under a pomegranate tree in Migron. The men with him numbered about six hundred.

(1 Samuel 14:3) 
Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh, was wearing the ephod. But even the people did not know where Jonathan had gone.

(1 Samuel 14:4) 
There were two prominent rocky crags on either side of the pass Jonathan intended to use to cross over to the Philistine outpost. These jagged rocks looked like sharp teeth, steep on both sides. One was named Bozez, and the other Sene.

(1 Samuel 14:5) 
One crag jutted out to the north, facing Michmas, and the other faced south, opposite Gibeah.

(1 Samuel 14:6) 
Then Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf. For it is not difficult for the Lord to bring salvation, whether by means of many soldiers or by only a few."

(1 Samuel 14:7) 
And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do whatever seems good to you. Go wherever you wish, for I am with you, just as you desire."

(1 Samuel 14:8) 
Then Jonathan said, "Look, we are crossing over to these men, and when we show ourselves to them,"

(1 Samuel 14:9) 
"if they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stay where we are and not climb up to them."

(1 Samuel 14:10) 
"But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will climb up, because that will be a sign for us that the Lord has delivered them into our hands."

(1 Samuel 14:11) 
So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost, and the Philistines said, "Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the caves where they have been hiding!"

(1 Samuel 14:12) 
Then the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, saying, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing or two!" Jonathan then said to his armor-bearer, "Follow me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hand of Israel."

(1 Samuel 14:13) 
So Jonathan climbed up, using both his hands and his feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed those who were close behind him.

(1 Samuel 14:14) 
In that first attack, Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men in a very small area of land—roughly the space a yoke of oxen could plow in half a day.

(1 Samuel 14:15) 
A great panic spread through the Philistine camp and across the fields. All the men who had gone out to plunder were stunned and fled, trembling with fear. Even the soldiers at the outpost and the raiders themselves were struck with terror.

(1 Samuel 14:16) 
Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the Philistine multitude was routed and scattered, fleeing in every direction.

(1 Samuel 14:17) 
Then Saul said to the people with him, "Check and see who among us has left." When they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.

(1 Samuel 14:18) 
Then Saul said to Ahiah, "Bring the Ark of God near." —For the Ark of God was with the children of Israel on that day.

(1 Samuel 14:19) 
While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew louder and more intense. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand! Stop consulting the Ark!"

(1 Samuel 14:20) 
Then Saul and all the people who were with him raised a war cry and rushed to the battle scene. There, they found the Philistines’ swords were turned against each other, and a very great slaughter was underway.

(1 Samuel 14:21) 
Furthermore, the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time—having even gone up with them into their camp—now turned back to join the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.

(1 Samuel 14:22) 
All the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines were fleeing, joined them in the pursuit. So the number of fighting men grew to about ten thousand.

(1 Samuel 14:23) 
Thus, the Lord saved Israel on that day. The battle, however, continued all the way to Beth-aven.

(1 Samuel 14:24) 
The men of Israel were exhausted that day, because Saul had bound the people with an oath, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats any food before evening, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the people tasted any food.

(1 Samuel 14:25) 
All the common people of the land came into a forest where there was wild honey on the ground.

(1 Samuel 14:26) 
When the people entered the forest, they saw honey dripping everywhere, yet no one put a hand to his mouth to eat it, for the people feared the oath.

(1 Samuel 14:27) 
Jonathan, however, had not heard when his father put the oath on the people. So he stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand, dipped it into a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth. Immediately, his eyes brightened, and his strength returned.

(1 Samuel 14:28) 
Then one of the people replied, "Your father solemnly bound the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats any food today!' That is why the people are so faint."

(1 Samuel 14:29) 
Jonathan then said, "My father has brought trouble upon the land. See how my eyes brightened and my strength returned just because I tasted a little of this honey!"

(1 Samuel 14:30) 
"How much greater a blow might have been struck against the Philistines if the people had been allowed to eat freely from the spoils they found, instead of being starved!"

(1 Samuel 14:31) 
On that day, they struck down the Philistines from Michmas all the way to Aijalon. By then, the people were utterly exhausted.

(1 Samuel 14:32) 
The people then rushed greedily for the spoils. They took sheep, oxen, and calves, slaughtered them directly on the ground, and ate the meat with the blood still in it—a violation of God’s Law.

(1 Samuel 14:33) 
Then someone reported to Saul, "Look, the people are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with the blood still in it!" He replied, "You have transgressed! Roll a large stone here to me at once!"

(1 Samuel 14:34) 
Saul then said, "Go out among the people and tell them, 'Each man is to bring his ox or his ram to me at once, and slaughter it here, and eat it. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with the blood still in it!'" So every one of the people brought his ox with his own hand to Saul and slaughtered it there.

(1 Samuel 14:35) 
Saul also built an altar to the Lord. This was the first altar he built to the Lord.

(1 Samuel 14:36) 
Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until morning, and let us not leave a single man among them." The people replied, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us come near to God here to inquire of Him."

(1 Samuel 14:37) 
So Saul inquired of the Lord, "Shall I pursue the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But the Lord did not answer him on that day.

(1 Samuel 14:38) 
Then Saul said, "Gather all the chiefs and leaders of the people here, and find out how this sin occurred today."

(1 Samuel 14:39) 
He swore an oath, "As the Lord, the Savior of Israel, lives, if this sin was committed by my own son Jonathan, he must surely die without fail!" But none of the people answered him.

(1 Samuel 14:40) 
Then he said to all Israel, "You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side." The people responded to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."

(1 Samuel 15:1) 
Samuel said to Saul: "The Lord sent me on a mission to anoint you as king over His people, Israel. Therefore, you must listen to the voice of the Lord now."

(1 Samuel 15:2) 
"Thus says the Lord of Armies: 'I have carefully observed all that Amalek did to Israel, specifically how they ambushed and fought against them on their journey when they came up out of Egypt.'"

(1 Samuel 15:3) 
"Now, therefore, go and attack Amalek. Utterly destroy everything they possess; do not spare them. You must kill every person—from man to woman, from small child to infant—and every animal—ox and sheep, camel and donkey."

(1 Samuel 15:4) 
So Saul gave orders to the people and counted them all, numbering them carefully: there were two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand men from the tribe of Judah.

(1 Samuel 15:5) 
When Saul arrived at the city of Amalek, he set up an ambush in the wadi, the valley floor near the city.

(1 Samuel 15:6) 
And Saul said to the Kenites: "Go now, depart, and separate yourselves from among the other Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you along with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

(1 Samuel 15:7) 
So Saul attacked Amalek from Havilah all the way to Shur, which lies opposite Egypt.

(1 Samuel 15:8) 
He captured Agag, the king of Amalek, alive, but all the rest of the people he put to death with the edge of the sword.

(1 Samuel 15:9) 
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and they spared the best of the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and the finest garments, and the rams—indeed, everything that was valuable. They did not want to destroy these. However, all the worthless and weak animals, they did kill.

(1 Samuel 15:10) 
Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:

(1 Samuel 15:11) 
"I am deeply grieved that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not carried out my commands." Samuel was greatly saddened by this news, and he cried out to the Lord all through the night.

(1 Samuel 15:12) 
When Samuel rose early in the morning to go to Saul, people reported to Samuel, saying: "Saul went to Carmel, and there he set up a triumphal monument for himself. Then he turned back, passed on, and went down to Gilgal."

(1 Samuel 15:13) 
When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, "May you be blessed by the Lord! I have carried out the Lord's command."

(1 Samuel 15:14) 
But Samuel said, "Then what is this sound of sheep bleating in my ears, and the lowing of cattle that I hear?"

(1 Samuel 15:15) 
Saul answered, "They brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the Lord your God. The rest we utterly destroyed."

(1 Samuel 15:16) 
Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night." And Saul said to him, "Speak."

(1 Samuel 15:17) 
And Samuel said: "Though you considered yourself small and insignificant in your own eyes, were you not made the leader of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel."

(1 Samuel 15:18) 
"And the Lord sent you on a mission, saying: 'Go and utterly destroy the sinful Amalekites, and fight against them until they are completely annihilated.'"

(1 Samuel 15:19) 
"Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord? Instead, you turned to the plunder and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord!"

(1 Samuel 15:20) 
Saul said to Samuel: "But I did obey the voice of the Lord! I went on the mission the Lord sent me on. I brought back Agag, the king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed the Amalekites!"

(1 Samuel 15:21) 
"But the people took from the spoil, from among the sheep and cattle, the very best of those things that were designated for utter destruction, with the intention of sacrificing them to the Lord your God in Gilgal."

(1 Samuel 15:22) 
And Samuel said: "Does the Lord truly desire burnt offerings and sacrifices, rather than obedience to His voice? For indeed, to obey is better than to offer animal sacrifices, and to listen attentively is better than to offer the fat of rams."

(1 Samuel 15:23) 
"For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like the wickedness of idolatry. Therefore, because you have rejected the word and command of the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."

(1 Samuel 15:24) 
Then Saul said to Samuel: "I have sinned, because I transgressed the command of the Lord and your instructions. I did this because I feared the people, and I listened to their voices more than to God's."

(1 Samuel 15:25) 
"Now therefore, I beg you, forgive my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord."

(1 Samuel 15:26) 
And Samuel said to Saul: "I will not return with you, for you have rejected the command of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."

(1 Samuel 15:27) 
As Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe, and it tore.

(1 Samuel 15:28) 
And Samuel said to him: "Just as this robe is torn, the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and He has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you."

(1 Samuel 15:29) 
Furthermore, the Eternal and Victorious One in Israel does not lie, nor does He change His mind, for He is not a man who feels regret or alters His plans.

(1 Samuel 15:30) 
And Saul said: "I have sinned. But please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God."

(1 Samuel 15:31) 
So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.

(1 Samuel 15:32) 
Then Samuel said: "Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag, who was very well-fed, was brought to him, and he was trembling. Agag said: "Surely the bitterness of death has passed now"—meaning he thought the danger was over.

(1 Samuel 15:33) 
And Samuel said: "Just as your sword has made many women childless, so now your mother will be childless among women." Then Samuel cut Agag into pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.

(1 Samuel 15:34) 
Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.

(1 Samuel 15:35) 
Samuel never saw Saul again until the day of his death. However, Samuel continued to grieve deeply for Saul. And the Lord was sorrowful that He had made Saul king over Israel.

(1 Samuel 15:1) 
And Samuel said to Saul: "The Lord Himself sent me on a mission to anoint you as king over His people, Israel. Therefore, now listen to the voice of the Lord."

(1 Samuel 15:2) 
The Lord of armies declares this: 'I have carefully recalled all that Amalec did to Israel, how he resisted him on the way when he came up out of Egypt.'

(1 Samuel 15:3) 
'Now therefore go and attack Amalec, and utterly destroy all that belongs to him. Do not spare him, but put to death every person, from man to woman, from little child to nursing infant. Also put to death every ox and sheep, every camel and donkey.'

(1 Samuel 15:4) 
So Saul summoned the people and counted them, as if they were lambs. There were two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand men from Judah.

(1 Samuel 15:5) 
And when Saul came to the city of Amalec, he set an ambush in the valley—along the dry riverbed.

(1 Samuel 15:6) 
Then Saul said to the Kenites: 'Go, and depart from Amalec, lest by chance I should involve you with them in their destruction. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.' So the Kenites departed from the midst of Amalec.

(1 Samuel 15:7) 
Saul then attacked Amalec from Havilah all the way to Shur, which faces Egypt.

(1 Samuel 15:8) 
And he seized Agag, the king of Amalec, alive. But he put all the ordinary people to death with the edge of the sword.

(1 Samuel 15:9) 
But Saul and his people spared Agag, as well as the best of the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and the garments, and the rams—indeed, everything that was good and valuable. They did not want to utterly destroy these things. But everything that was vile and contemptible, that they utterly destroyed.

(1 Samuel 15:10) 
Now the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:

(1 Samuel 15:11) 
'I regret that I made Saul king, because he has forsaken me and has not carried out my commands. Samuel was deeply saddened by this, and he cried out to the Lord all that night.

(1 Samuel 15:12) 
When Samuel rose in the night to go to Saul in the morning, it was reported to Samuel, by someone, that Saul had come to Carmel, and had set up a triumphant arch for himself, and had then turned back and gone to Gilgal.

(1 Samuel 15:13) 
So Samuel came to Saul. And Saul was offering a burnt offering to the Lord from the first-fruits of the spoil that he had brought back from Amalec.

(1 Samuel 15:14) 
And Samuel said: "What then is this bleating of the flocks that echoes in my ears, and the lowing of the herds that I hear?"

(1 Samuel 15:15) 
And Saul said: "They brought these things from Amalec. For the people spared the best sheep and cattle, so that they might be sacrificed to the Lord your God. The rest, however, we utterly destroyed."

(1 Samuel 15:16) 
Then Samuel said to Saul: "Allow me, and I will declare to you what the Lord has spoken to me during the night." And Saul said to him: "Speak."

(1 Samuel 15:17) 
And Samuel said: "Although you may have been small in your own estimation, were you not made the head over the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel.

(1 Samuel 15:18) 
And the Lord sent you on a journey and said: 'Go and put to death the sinners of Amalec, and you shall fight against them until their complete destruction.'

(1 Samuel 15:19) 
Why then did you not listen to the voice of the Lord? Instead, you turned to plunder and did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 15:20) 
And Saul said to Samuel: "Indeed, I did listen to the voice of the Lord. I walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought back Agag, the king of Amalec, and I utterly destroyed Amalec.

(1 Samuel 15:21) 
But the people took from the spoils some sheep and cattle, the very best of those that were to be slain, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God in Gilgal."

(1 Samuel 15:22) 
But Samuel said: "Does the Lord desire burnt offerings and sacrifices, and not rather that His voice be obeyed? Truly, to obey is better than to offer sacrifices, and to listen is better than to offer the fat of rams.

(1 Samuel 15:23) 
For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like the wickedness of idolatry. Therefore, because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord has also rejected you from being king over Israel."

(1 Samuel 15:24) 
Then Saul said to Samuel: "I have sinned, because I have violated the command of the Lord and your words, fearing the people and obeying their voice."

(1 Samuel 15:25) 
"Now therefore, I beg you, forgive my sin, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord."

(1 Samuel 15:26) 
And Samuel said to Saul: "I will not return with you, because you have cast aside the word of the Lord, and the Lord has cast you aside from being king over Israel."

(1 Samuel 15:27) 
And as Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the edge of his cloak, and it tore.

(1 Samuel 15:28) 
And Samuel said to him: "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you."

(1 Samuel 15:29) 
Furthermore, the Victorious One in Israel—that is, God—will not relent, and will not be swayed by repentance. For He is not a man that He should be swayed by repentance.

(1 Samuel 15:30) 
And Saul said: "I have sinned. But honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God."

(1 Samuel 15:31) 
So Samuel returned and followed Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.

(1 Samuel 15:32) 
And Samuel said: "Bring Agag, the king of Amalec, to me." And Agag was brought to him—Agag was very fat and trembling, and he said: "Surely the bitterness of death is now past?"

(1 Samuel 15:33) 
And Samuel said: "Just as your sword made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women." And Samuel cut Agag into pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.

(1 Samuel 15:34) 
Then Samuel went to Ramah. But Saul went up to his own house in Gibeah of Saul.

(1 Samuel 15:35) 
And Samuel never saw Saul again until the day of his death. Nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.

(1 Samuel 16:1) 
The Lord then said to Samuel: "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have already rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and come, so I may send you to Jesse, the man from Bethlehem. For I have prepared a king for Myself among his sons."

(1 Samuel 16:2) 
Samuel replied: "How can I go? For Saul will hear about it and will kill me." The Lord answered: "Take a calf from the herd with you in your hand, and say: 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.'"

(1 Samuel 16:3) 
And invite Jesse to the sacrifice. Then I will show you what you must do, and you shall anoint the one whom I point out to you.

(1 Samuel 16:4) 
So Samuel did exactly as the Lord had told him. He arrived in Bethlehem. The elders of the city were astonished at his coming; they hurried to meet him and asked: "Is your arrival for peace?"

(1 Samuel 16:5) 
Samuel said: "Yes, it is for peace. I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves and come with me so I may perform the sacrifice." So he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.

(1 Samuel 16:6) 
When they had entered, Samuel saw Eliab. And Samuel thought to himself: "Surely this is the Lord's Anointed One, standing here before the Lord."

(1 Samuel 16:7) 
But the Lord said to Samuel: "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For I do not judge according to what a human judges: a human sees what is visible, but the Lord looks at the heart."

(1 Samuel 16:8) 
Then Jesse called Abinadab and brought him before Samuel. But Samuel said: "The Lord has not chosen this one either."

(1 Samuel 16:9) 
Next, Jesse brought Shamma. And Samuel said: "The Lord has not chosen this one either."

(1 Samuel 16:10) 
So Jesse brought seven of his sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse: "The Lord has not chosen any of these."

(1 Samuel 16:11) 
Then Samuel asked Jesse: "Are all your sons here?" Jesse answered: "There is still the youngest one left, and he is tending the sheep." Samuel said to Jesse: "Send for him and bring him here, because we will not sit down to eat until he comes."

(1 Samuel 16:12) 
So Jesse sent for him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome face. And the Lord said: "Arise, anoint him, for this is he."

(1 Samuel 16:13) 
Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord was powerfully present with David from that day forward. Then Samuel arose and went back to Ramah.

(1 Samuel 16:14) 
Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit tormented him, sent by the Lord to afflict him.

(1 Samuel 16:15) 
Saul's servants said to him: "Behold, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you."

(1 Samuel 16:16) 
"Let our lord command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skilled at playing the lyre, so that when the evil spirit from God seizes you, he may play with his hand, and you may find relief."

(1 Samuel 16:17) 
Saul said to his servants: "Then provide me with a man who plays well, and bring him to me."

(1 Samuel 16:18) 
Then one of the young men answered and said: "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilled in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a warrior, and prudent in speech, and a handsome man. And the Lord is with him."

(1 Samuel 16:19) 
So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying: "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep in the pastures."

(1 Samuel 16:20) 
Then Jesse took a donkey laden with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul, as a gift.

(1 Samuel 16:21) 
So David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul loved him dearly, and David became his armor-bearer.

(1 Samuel 16:22) 
Saul then sent word to Jesse, saying: "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my eyes."

(1 Samuel 16:23) 
Therefore, whenever the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, David would take up his lyre and play with his hand. Then Saul would be refreshed and feel better, for the evil spirit would leave him.

(1 Samuel 16:1) 
And the Lord said to Samuel: 'How long will you mourn for Saul? —I have already rejected him from reigning over Israel. Fill your anointing horn with oil, and come, so that I may send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king from among his sons.'

(1 Samuel 16:2) 
And Samuel said: 'How can I go? For Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me.' And the Lord said: 'Take a young heifer from the herd with you in your hand, and say: 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.''

(1 Samuel 16:3) 
And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint the one whom I show you.

(1 Samuel 16:4) 
So Samuel did as the Lord commanded him. And he came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city were astonished. They came to meet him and asked: 'Is your coming peaceful?'

(1 Samuel 16:5) 
And he said: 'It is peaceful. I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. Purify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice' —this involves ritual cleansing. So Jesse purified himself and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.

(1 Samuel 16:6) 
When they came in, Samuel saw Eliab and thought: 'Surely the Lord's Anointed is before Him!' —Samuel initially judged by outward appearance.

(1 Samuel 16:7) 
But the Lord said to Samuel: 'Do not look at his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. I do not judge as man judges. For man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart.'

(1 Samuel 16:8) 
Then Jesse called Abinadab and brought him before Samuel. And Samuel said: 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'

(1 Samuel 16:9) 
Then Jesse brought Shammah, of whom Samuel said: 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'

(1 Samuel 16:10) 
So Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse: 'The Lord has not chosen any of these.'

(1 Samuel 16:11) 
Then Samuel said to Jesse: 'Are these all your sons who remain?' And Jesse replied: 'There still remains the youngest, and he is tending the sheep.' And Samuel said to Jesse: 'Send for him and bring him here, for we will not sit down to eat until he comes here.'

(1 Samuel 16:12) 
So Jesse sent and brought him in. He was reddish, with beautiful eyes, and a handsome appearance. And the Lord said: 'Arise, anoint him, for this is the one.'

(1 Samuel 16:13) 
Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon David mightily from that day forward. Then Samuel arose and went to Ramah.

(1 Samuel 16:14) 
Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit sent by the Lord tormented him —this doesn't imply God is evil but rather that He allowed or ordained this affliction as a consequence of Saul's disobedience.

(1 Samuel 16:15) 
And Saul's servants said to him: 'Behold, an evil spirit from the Lord is tormenting you.'

(1 Samuel 16:16) 
'Let our lord command, and your servants will search for someone who can play the lyre well. Then, when the evil spirit from the Lord takes hold of you, he can play with his hand, and you will be relieved' —the music would soothe and distract, perhaps creating a more peaceful internal state.

(1 Samuel 16:17) 
And Saul said to his servants: 'Find me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.'

(1 Samuel 16:18) 
Then one of the young men answered and said: 'Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing the lyre, and he is a mighty warrior, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a handsome man. And the Lord is with him' —this is high praise, acknowledging David's diverse talents and God's favor.

(1 Samuel 16:19) 
So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying: 'Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.'

(1 Samuel 16:20) 
So Jesse took an ass loaded with bread, and a flask of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul —these were gifts appropriate for a vassal presenting his son to a king.

(1 Samuel 16:21) 
And David came to Saul and stood before him. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer —this was an important position of trust and proximity to the king.

(1 Samuel 16:22) 
And Saul sent word to Jesse, saying: 'Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight' —meaning, he has pleased me or I am pleased with him.

(1 Samuel 16:23) 
Therefore, whenever the evil spirit from the Lord seized Saul, David would take his lyre and play it with his hand. Then Saul would be refreshed and feel better, for the evil spirit would depart from him.

(1 Samuel 16:24) 
Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. They assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and they encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.

(1 Samuel 16:25) 
Saul and the men of Israel assembled and came to the Valley of Elah, and they drew up their battle line against the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 16:26) 
The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side. And there was a valley between them.

(1 Samuel 16:27) 
Then a champion came out of the Philistine camp, named Goliath, from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span —approximately nine feet nine inches tall.

(1 Samuel 16:28) 
He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with a scale-armor breastplate. The weight of his breastplate was five thousand shekels of bronze —approximately one hundred and twenty-five pounds of bronze.

(1 Samuel 16:29) 
And he had bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze shield was carried between his shoulders.

(1 Samuel 16:30) 
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of iron —approximately fifteen pounds. And his armor-bearer went before him.

(1 Samuel 16:31) 
Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them: 'Why have you come out and drawn up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me for single combat!'

(1 Samuel 16:32) 
'If he is able to fight with me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail and defeat him, then you will be our servants, and you will serve us.'

(1 Samuel 16:33) 
And the Philistine said: 'I have defied the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight in single combat!'

(1 Samuel 16:34) 
When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid —the challenge was terrifying due to Goliath's immense size and weaponry.

(1 Samuel 16:35) 
Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah. His name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And in the days of Saul, the man Jesse was old and well advanced in years among men —this clarifies Jesse's age and prominence in his community.

(1 Samuel 16:36) 
And Jesse's three oldest sons had gone after Saul to the battle. Their names were: the firstborn Eliab, the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

(1 Samuel 16:37) 
David was the youngest. So while the three oldest followed Saul,

(1 Samuel 16:38) 
David had gone away and returned from Saul's service. He went back to feed his father's flock in Bethlehem —this explains why David was not immediately present at the battle, indicating a period of time has passed.

(1 Samuel 16:39) 
And the Philistine came forward morning and evening. He stood challenging for forty days —this emphasizes the prolonged terror and the immense pressure on the Israelite army.

(1 Samuel 16:40) 
Then Jesse said to David his son: 'Take for your brothers this ephah of roasted grain, and these ten loaves of bread. And hurry to the camp to your brothers.'

(1 Samuel 17:1) 
Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. They assembled at Socho in Judah, and they set up their camp between Socho and Azeca, in the territory of Ephesdammim.

(1 Samuel 17:2) 
But Saul and the men of Israel gathered together. They came to the Valley of Terebinth and set up their camp opposite the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 17:3) 
The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side. A valley was between them.

(1 Samuel 17:4) 
Then a mighty warrior came out from the Philistine camp, whose name was Goliath, from Gath. He was six cubits and a palm in height—an incredible height for a man.

(1 Samuel 17:5) 
A bronze helmet was on his head, and he wore a coat of scaled armor. The weight of his armor was five thousand shekels of bronze.

(1 Samuel 17:6) 
Bronze greaves were on his legs, and a bronze shield protected his shoulders.

(1 Samuel 17:7) 
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield-bearer walked before him.

(1 Samuel 17:8) 
He stood and shouted at the battle lines of Israel, saying to them: "Why have you come out prepared for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man from among yourselves, and let him come down for single combat."

(1 Samuel 17:9) 
"If he can fight with me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I overpower him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us."

(1 Samuel 17:10) 
And the Philistine added: "I have defied the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, and I will enter into single combat with him!"

(1 Samuel 17:11) 
When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were greatly troubled and became very afraid.

(1 Samuel 17:12) 
Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. And during the time of Saul, this man was old and advanced in years among men.

(1 Samuel 17:13) 
And Jesse's three eldest sons had gone to battle with Saul. Their names were: the firstborn Amnadab, the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

(1 Samuel 17:14) 
But David was the youngest. So the three eldest had followed Saul.

(1 Samuel 17:15) 
David had gone and returned from Saul to tend his father's flock in Bethlehem.

(1 Samuel 17:16) 
The Philistine came forward morning and evening. And he stood there for forty days, challenging them daily.

(1 Samuel 17:17) 
Now Jesse said to his son David: "Take this ephah of parched grain for your brothers, and these ten loaves of bread. And hurry to the camp, to your brothers."

(1 Samuel 17:18) 
"And these ten cheeses you shall bring to the commander (tribune). And visit your brothers, see how they are doing, and bring back word from them."

(1 Samuel 17:19) 
Now Saul, and his men, and all the men of Israel, were in the Valley of Terebinth, engaged in war against the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 17:20) 
So David rose early in the morning, leaving the flock with a keeper for his father. And taking the provisions, he went as Jesse had commanded him. He arrived at the camp just as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting the war cry.

(1 Samuel 17:21) 
And Israel and the Philistines had drawn up their battle lines, arrayed line against line.

(1 Samuel 17:22) 
David left the things he had brought in the care of the baggage keeper. He ran to the battle line and asked his brothers how they were doing.

(1 Samuel 17:23) 
While he was still speaking, behold, that mighty warrior named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the Philistine camp. And he spoke according to his previous words, and David heard him.

(1 Samuel 17:24) 
Now all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from his presence and were greatly afraid.

(1 Samuel 17:25) 
And everyone said to his neighbor: "Have you seen this man who has come up? He has certainly come up to defy Israel. The man who strikes him down will be greatly enriched by the king, and the king will give him his daughter, and he will make his father's house free from tribute in Israel."

(1 Samuel 17:26) 
And David said to the men who stood by him, saying: "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who has defied the armies of the living God? And what will be the reward for the man who strikes him down and removes this disgrace from Israel?"

(1 Samuel 17:27) 
And the people repeated to him the former words, saying: "These things will be given to the man who strikes him down."

(1 Samuel 17:28) 
Now Amnadab, his eldest brother, heard him speaking to the others. And he became angry with David, and he said: "Why have you come down here? And to whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the wickedness of your heart, because you have come down only to see the battle."

(1 Samuel 17:29) 
And David said: "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"

(1 Samuel 17:30) 
And he turned away from Amnadab and spoke to another man with the same question as before. And the people gave him the same answer as before.

(1 Samuel 17:31) 
Now the words which David spoke were heard. And they were reported in the presence of Saul. And when Saul heard, he sent for him.

(1 Samuel 17:32) 
And David said to Saul: "Let no one's heart fail because of this. I, your servant, will go and fight against this Philistine."

(1 Samuel 17:33) 
And Saul said to David: "You are not able to stand against this Philistine, nor to fight against him. For you are but a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth."

(1 Samuel 17:34) 
And David said to Saul: "Your servant was tending his father's flock as a shepherd. And when a lion or a bear came and carried off a ram from the middle of the flock,"

(1 Samuel 17:35) 
"I would pursue it and strike it down, and rescue the ram from its mouth. And if it rose up against me, I would seize its jaw, and choke it, and kill it."

(1 Samuel 17:36) 
"Indeed, your servant has killed both a lion and a bear. Therefore, this uncircumcised Philistine I will destroy just like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God."

(1 Samuel 17:37) 
And David added: "The Lord, who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He himself will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David: "Go, and may the Lord be with you."

(1 Samuel 17:38) 
And Saul clothed David with his own garments. And he put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with a coat of mail.

(1 Samuel 17:39) 
And David girded his sword over his garments. He began to try walking, for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: "I cannot go with these, for I am not accustomed to them." And he took them off.

(1 Samuel 17:40) 
And he took his staff, which he always held in his hands. And he chose for himself five smooth stones from the stream. And he put them in his shepherd's bag which he had with him. And he held his sling in his hand, and he went forward against the Philistine.

(1 Samuel 17:1) 
Now the Philistines gathered their armies for war. They assembled in Socco of Judah, setting up their camp between Socco and Azeca, in a place called Ephes Dammim.

(1 Samuel 17:2) 
Saul and the men of Israel also gathered. They came to the Valley of Terebinth and arranged their battle lines, preparing to fight against the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 17:3) 
The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and the Israelites stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley separating them.

(1 Samuel 17:4) 
Then a special champion warrior came out of the Philistine camp. His name was Goliath, and he was from the city of Gath. He was an enormous man, measuring six cubits and a palm in height—a massive giant.

(1 Samuel 17:5) 
He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore a coat of scale-armor made of bronze, which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.

(1 Samuel 17:6) 
He wore bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze buckler shield was on his shoulders.

(1 Samuel 17:7) 
The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the iron head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield-bearer walked ahead of him.

(1 Samuel 17:8) 
Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite battle lines, saying, “Why have you come out to prepare for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man from among yourselves to come down and fight me in single combat.”

(1 Samuel 17:9) 
He continued, “If he can fight against me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I overcome him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”

(1 Samuel 17:10) 
The Philistine also added, “I have openly defied the Israelite armies today! Give me a man, and let us fight each other!”

(1 Samuel 17:11) 
When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were terrified, and they greatly feared him.

(1 Samuel 17:12) 
Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons, and he himself was an old man, advanced in years among men.

(1 Samuel 17:13) 
Jesse’s three oldest sons had gone with Saul to the battle. Their names were Eliab, the firstborn; Abinadab, the second; and Shamma, the third.

(1 Samuel 17:14) 
David was the youngest. So while the three oldest sons followed Saul to battle,

(1 Samuel 17:15) 
David had left the military service and returned from Saul’s camp to shepherd his father’s flock in Bethlehem.

(1 Samuel 17:16) 
The Philistine champion, Goliath, would come forward every morning and evening. He took his stand and issued his challenge for forty days.

(1 Samuel 17:17) 
Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers. Hurry and bring them to your brothers in the camp.”

(1 Samuel 17:18) 
He continued, “Also, take these ten cheeses to the captain. See how your brothers are doing, and bring back a report of their welfare and what is happening there.”

(1 Samuel 17:19) 
Now Saul, and Jesse's sons, and all the men of Israel, were in the Valley of Terebinth, fighting against the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 17:20) 
So David got up early in the morning. He left the flock with a keeper and, laden with supplies, went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the camp, just as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting the battle cry.

(1 Samuel 17:21) 
Both Israel and the Philistines had drawn up their battle lines, arrayed against each other.

(1 Samuel 17:22) 
David left his baggage, which was his responsibility, with the keeper of the supplies. He then ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers if everything was well with them.

(1 Samuel 17:23) 
While he was still speaking with them, the champion warrior appeared. It was Goliath by name, the Philistine from Gath, emerging from the Philistine battle line. He spoke the very same defiant words as before, and David heard them.

(1 Samuel 17:24) 
All the Israelites who saw the man fled from his presence, fearing him greatly.

(1 Samuel 17:25) 
And each one said to his neighbor, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has come up to defy Israel. The king has promised to greatly enrich the man who defeats him, give him his daughter in marriage, and make his father’s house exempt from taxes in Israel.”

(1 Samuel 17:26) 
David then said to the men standing with him, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine who dares to defy the armies of the living God?”

(1 Samuel 17:27) 
The people repeated the same words to him, saying, “This is what the king will do for the man who defeats him.”

(1 Samuel 17:28) 
Now Eliab, his oldest brother, heard him speaking to the others. Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil intention of your heart, for you have come down only to see the battle!”

(1 Samuel 17:29) 
David replied, “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?”

(1 Samuel 17:30) 
He turned away from Eliab and asked another man. He spoke according to the same question, and the people answered him as they had before.

(1 Samuel 17:31) 
When David’s words were heard, they were reported to Saul. And when Saul heard about them, he sent for David.

(1 Samuel 17:32) 
David said to Saul, “Let no man’s courage fail because of this giant. I, your servant, will go and fight against this Philistine.”

(1 Samuel 17:33) 
Saul said to David, “You are not strong enough to stand against this Philistine or fight against him. You are just a youth, while he has been a warrior since his adolescence.”

(1 Samuel 17:34) 
David replied to Saul, “I was my father’s shepherd of the flock. When a lion or a bear came and snatched a lamb from the middle of the flock,

(1 Samuel 17:35) 
I pursued it, attacked it, and rescued the lamb from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab its jaw, strike it, and kill it.

(1 Samuel 17:36) 
Indeed, I have killed both a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them! Let him go and take away the defiance from Israel, because who is this uncircumcised man who dares to curse the army of the living God?”

(1 Samuel 17:37) 
David also added, “The Lord, who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He Himself will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and may the Lord be with you.”

(1 Samuel 17:38) 
Then Saul dressed David in his own armor. He placed a bronze helmet on David’s head and clothed him with a coat of mail.

(1 Samuel 17:39) 
David buckled Saul’s sword over his own clothes and tried to walk, but he found he could not, because he had never worn such things before. So David said to Saul, “I cannot walk in these, for I am not accustomed to them.” And he took them off.

(1 Samuel 17:40) 
Then he took his staff, which he always carried in his hand. He chose five smooth stones from the stream bed and put them in his shepherd’s bag, which he had with him, and his sling was in his hand. And so he went forward against the Philistine.

(1 Samuel 18:1) 
It came to pass that when David finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan’s soul was bound to David’s soul, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

(1 Samuel 18:2) 
Saul took David into his service that day and no longer allowed him to return to his father’s house.

(1 Samuel 18:3) 
So Jonathan and David made a covenant of friendship, for Jonathan loved David as his own soul.

(1 Samuel 18:4) 
And Jonathan took off the cloak he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his other garments, even his sword, bow, and belt.

(1 Samuel 18:5) 
Moreover, David went out wherever Saul sent him, and he acted wisely. So Saul placed him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the eyes of all the people, and in the eyes of Saul’s servants.

(1 Samuel 18:6) 
When David returned after killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel, singing in choruses and rejoicing to meet King Saul, with tambourines and musical instruments.

(1 Samuel 18:7) 
And the women sang playfully, saying: 'Saul has struck down a thousand, and David ten thousand!'

(1 Samuel 18:8) 
But Saul was exceedingly angry, and this saying displeased him. And he said: 'They have given David ten thousand, and to me they have given only a thousand. What more is left for him to have, except the kingdom itself?'

(1 Samuel 18:9) 
Therefore, Saul suspected David from that day forward.

(1 Samuel 18:10) 
But on the next day, an evil spirit from the Lord seized Saul, and he raved inside his house. David, meanwhile, played the lyre with his hand as he did every day, and a spear was in Saul’s hand.

(1 Samuel 18:11) 
And Saul threw the spear, thinking and saying: 'I will pin David to the wall!' But David dodged away from him twice.

(1 Samuel 18:12) 
And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and had departed from Saul.

(1 Samuel 18:13) 
Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and made him a tribune and commander over a thousand men. And David went out and came in before the people.

(1 Samuel 18:14) 
In all his ways, David conducted himself wisely, and the Lord was with him.

(1 Samuel 18:15) 
So Saul saw that David conducted himself very wisely, and he began to fear him greatly.

(1 Samuel 18:16) 
But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.

(1 Samuel 18:17) 
Then Saul said to David: 'Behold, my elder daughter Merob, I will give her to you as a wife. Only be a strong man and fight the Lord’s battles.' Saul, however, was thinking, saying: 'Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.'

(1 Samuel 18:18) 
And David said to Saul: 'Who am I? Or what is my life? Or what is my father’s family in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?'

(1 Samuel 18:19) 
But it came to pass that at the time when Merob, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given to Hadriel the Meholathite as his wife.

(1 Samuel 18:20) 
Now Michol, Saul’s other daughter, loved David. And it was reported to Saul, and it pleased him.

(1 Samuel 18:21) 
And Saul said: 'I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.' So Saul said to David: 'You shall be my son-in-law a second time!'

(1 Samuel 18:22) 
And Saul commanded his servants: 'Speak to David in secret, saying: "Behold, the king loves you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, you can become the king’s son-in-law!"'

(1 Samuel 18:23) 
And Saul’s servants spoke these words in David’s ears. And David said: 'Does it seem a small thing to you to be the king’s son-in-law? Yet I am a poor and humble man.'

(1 Samuel 18:24) 
And Saul’s servants reported to him, saying: 'This is what David has said.'

(1 Samuel 18:25) 
And Saul said: 'Speak thus to David: "The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, so that there may be vengeance against the king’s enemies."' But Saul was thinking to deliver David into the hands of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 18:26) 
When his servants reported to David the words that Saul had spoken, the offer pleased David, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And the days appointed for the dowry had not yet passed.

(1 Samuel 18:27) 
So David arose and went with his men, and he struck down two hundred men from the Philistines. And he brought their foreskins and counted them out to the king, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Therefore, Saul gave him Michol his daughter as a wife.

(1 Samuel 18:28) 
And Saul saw and understood that the Lord was with David, and that Michol, Saul’s daughter, truly loved him.

(1 Samuel 18:29) 
And Saul increased his fear of David even more. And Saul became an enemy of David all his days.

(1 Samuel 18:30) 
And the princes of the Philistines went out to battle. And as often as they went out, David conducted himself more wisely than all of Saul’s servants, and his name became exceedingly famous.

(1 Samuel 19:1) 
Now King Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and to all his personal attendants, giving them orders to kill David.

(1 Samuel 19:2) 
But Jonathan, King Saul’s son, truly loved David. So Jonathan told David, saying, 'My father Saul is trying to kill you. So be careful tomorrow morning. You must stay hidden and conceal yourself.

(1 Samuel 19:3) 
I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are hiding. I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I find out, I will tell you.'

(1 Samuel 19:4) 
So Jonathan spoke good things about David to his father Saul. He said to the king, 'Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been very beneficial to you.

(1 Samuel 19:5) 
He risked his own life and struck down the Philistine giant, Goliath. Through him, the Lord granted a great victory to all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then would you sin by shedding innocent blood, by killing David, who is without fault?'

(1 Samuel 19:6) 
When Saul heard Jonathan’s words, he swore an oath, saying, 'As the Lord lives, David will not be killed.'

(1 Samuel 19:7) 
So Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David was in Saul’s presence again, just as he had been before, for the past several days.

(1 Samuel 19:8) 
Then war broke out again. David went out and fought against the Philistines. He struck them with a great defeat, and they fled from his presence.

(1 Samuel 19:9) 
But an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear ready in his hand. David was playing music with his hand (the lyre).

(1 Samuel 19:10) 
Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear. But David dodged Saul, and the spear struck the wall. David fled and escaped that very night.

(1 Samuel 19:11) 
Saul sent his executioners to David’s house to keep watch over him and kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michol told him, saying, 'Unless you save yourself tonight, tomorrow morning you will die.'

(1 Samuel 19:12) 
So Michol let David down through a window. He left immediately, fled, and escaped.

(1 Samuel 19:13) 
Now Michol took a household idol (a teraphim), placed it on the bed, put goat’s hair at its head, and covered it with a cloak.

(1 Samuel 19:14) 
When Saul sent his messengers to seize David, they were told, 'He is sick.'

(1 Samuel 19:15) 
Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, 'Bring him up to me on the bed, so that he may be killed.'

(1 Samuel 19:16) 
When the messengers came in, behold, there was the idol on the bed, with the goat’s hair at its head.

(1 Samuel 19:17) 
Then Saul said to Michol, 'Why have you deceived me in this way, and let my enemy escape?' Michol answered Saul, 'Because he himself threatened me, saying: 'Let me go, or I will kill you.''

(1 Samuel 19:18) 
So David fled and was saved. He came to Samuel in Ramatha and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Najoth.

(1 Samuel 19:19) 
It was reported to Saul, saying, 'Behold, David is in Najoth in Ramatha.'

(1 Samuel 19:20) 
So Saul sent his executioners to seize David. When they saw the company of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s executioners as well, and they too began to prophesy.

(1 Samuel 19:21) 
When this was reported to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also began to prophesy. Even more angered, Saul sent a third group of messengers, and they too began to prophesy.

(1 Samuel 19:22) 
So Saul himself went to Ramatha and came as far as the great well that is in Socho. He asked, saying, 'Where are Samuel and David?' And he was told, 'Behold, they are in Najoth in Ramatha.'

(1 Samuel 19:23) 
And as he went on to Najoth in Ramatha, the Spirit of God came upon him too, and he walked on, prophesying, until he arrived in Najoth in Ramatha.

(1 Samuel 19:24) 
He even stripped off his own garments and prophesied with the others before Samuel. He lay there unclothed for that entire day and night. That is why the proverb came about: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'

(1 Samuel 19:2) 
But Jonathan, King Saul’s son, loved David very much. So Jonathan secretly sent word to David, saying: “My father, King Saul, is seeking to kill you. Therefore, I beg you, be on your guard tomorrow morning. You must go into hiding, and remain concealed.”

(1 Samuel 19:3) 
“And I myself will go out and stand beside my father in the open field, wherever he may happen to be. I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover, I will report back to you immediately.”

(1 Samuel 19:4) 
So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father, King Saul. He pleaded with him, saying: “Let not the king commit a sin against his own faithful servant David. For David has committed no sin against you, and indeed, his deeds have been very beneficial to you.”

(1 Samuel 19:5) 
“David risked his very life and went into battle, striking down the Philistine giant. By his hand, the Lord brought about a great victory for all of Israel. You saw it then, and you greatly rejoiced. Why then would you sin against innocent blood, and kill David, who is truly without fault?”

(1 Samuel 19:6) 
King Saul listened to the earnest plea of Jonathan. And so King Saul swore an oath, declaring: “As the Lord lives, David shall not be put to death.”

(1 Samuel 19:7) 
Then Jonathan called David, and told him all of these words. And Jonathan brought David to King Saul, and David remained in his presence, serving him just as he had done on previous days.

(1 Samuel 19:8) 
Then war broke out yet again. So David went out and fought against the Philistines, striking them down with such a devastating blow that they fled in terror from his presence.

(1 Samuel 19:9) 
And then, again, an evil spirit from the Lord troubled King Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing his lyre and singing hymns to soothe him.

(1 Samuel 19:10) 
King Saul sought to pin David to the wall with his spear. But David quickly moved away from Saul’s presence, and Saul’s spear struck the wall instead. David immediately fled, and he was saved from death that very night.

(1 Samuel 19:11) 
So King Saul sent his messengers to David’s house to keep watch over him through the night, intending to kill him in the morning. David’s wife, Michal, secretly informed him, saying: “Unless you make your escape this very night, you will surely be dead by tomorrow.”

(1 Samuel 19:12) 
So Michal helped David escape by letting him down through a window. He immediately departed, fled for his life, and managed to escape.

(1 Samuel 19:13) 
Michal then took a household idol, a *teraphim*, and placed it on the bed. She put a network of goat hair at its head to mimic human hair, and then covered the idol with a garment to make it look like a sleeping person.

(1 Samuel 19:14) 
When King Saul sent messengers to seize David, they were given the answer: “He is sick in bed.”

(1 Samuel 19:15) 
King Saul sent the messengers back to see David, commanding: “Bring him here to me, even in his bed, so that I may put him to death myself.”

(1 Samuel 19:16) 
But when the messengers arrived, behold, they found only the household idol lying on the bed, with the network of goat hair at its head.

(1 Samuel 19:17) 
King Saul then confronted Michal, saying: “Why have you so shamelessly deceived me and allowed my enemy to escape?” Michal answered Saul: “Because he threatened me directly, saying: ‘Let me go, or else I will kill you.’”

(1 Samuel 19:18) 
In the meantime, David, having fled for his life, was saved. He came to the prophet Samuel in Ramath, and told him everything that King Saul had done to him. Then David and Samuel went to Najoth in Ramath and stayed there together.

(1 Samuel 19:19) 
And it was reported to King Saul, saying: “Behold, David is in Najoth in Ramath.”

(1 Samuel 19:20) 
So King Saul sent messengers to seize David. But when they arrived and saw the company of prophets engaged in prophetic utterance, with Samuel standing over them as their leader, the Spirit of the Lord also came upon King Saul’s messengers, and they too began to prophesy.

(1 Samuel 19:21) 
But when this was reported to King Saul, he sent yet another group of messengers. They also began to prophesy when they arrived. And a third time King Saul sent messengers, and they too began to prophesy. At this, King Saul became extremely angry, and he himself departed for Ramath.

(1 Samuel 19:22) 
And he came as far as the great well that is in Socho. He then inquired, asking: “In what place are Samuel and David?” And one of the men there told him: “Behold, they are in Najoth, in Ramath.”

(1 Samuel 19:23) 
So King Saul went there to Najoth in Ramath. And the Spirit of the Lord also came upon him. As he walked along the way, he continued prophesying until he reached Najoth in Ramath.

(1 Samuel 19:24) 
And he too stripped himself of his royal garments, and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there naked, prostrate on the ground, for that entire day and all through the night. This is why the proverb came into being: “Is Saul also counted among the prophets?”

(1 Samuel 20:1) 
But David fled from Naioth, which is in Ramah. He then came before Jonathan and asked: "What have I done? What is my sin, and what is my iniquity against your father, that he is seeking my very life?"

(1 Samuel 20:2) 
Jonathan answered him: "Far be it from you to think that! You shall not die. For my father does nothing, whether great or small, without first revealing it to me. Why then would my father hide this matter from me? It is not as you think."

(1 Samuel 20:3) 
But David swore again and said: "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes. He said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this, lest he be grieved.' Truly, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, there is only a step between me and death."

(1 Samuel 20:4) 
Jonathan then said to David: "Whatever your soul desires, I will do for you."

(1 Samuel 20:5) 
David said to Jonathan: "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon festival, and I cannot eat with the king. I must be absent."

(1 Samuel 20:6) 
"Therefore, let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the evening of the third day."

(1 Samuel 20:7) 
"If your father asks for me, you shall answer him: 'David earnestly requested me to let him go to Bethlehem, his own city, because there is a solemn sacrifice there for all his relatives.'"

(1 Samuel 20:8) 
"If he says, 'It is well,' then your servant is safe. But if he becomes angry, know for certain that his evil intent is fixed."

(1 Samuel 20:9) 
"Therefore, deal mercifully with your servant, for you have brought me, your servant, into a covenant of the Lord with you. If there is any iniquity in me, kill me yourself; do not bring me to your father."

(1 Samuel 20:10) 
Jonathan said to him: "Far be it from you to think that! For if I should certainly know that evil has been determined by my father to come upon you, I myself will tell you."

(1 Samuel 20:11) 
David said to Jonathan: "Who will inform me if your father answers you harshly?"

(1 Samuel 20:12) 
Jonathan said to David: "Come, let us go out into the field." So both of them went out into the field.

(1 Samuel 20:13) 
Then Jonathan said to David: "May the Lord, the God of Israel, be a witness! I will diligently question my father. If there is anything good concerning David, I will surely send word to you and reveal it to you without delay."

(1 Samuel 20:14) 
"This I say: may you never perish." —meaning, may your life and lineage be preserved.

(1 Samuel 20:15) 
"Or if my house perishes, when the Lord has brought evil upon the earth against all the enemies of David,"

(1 Samuel 20:16) 
"may Jonathan himself be cast off from your sight forever. But you also shall show the Lord's mercy to your servant forever, and you shall not kill me."

(1 Samuel 20:17) 
Jonathan therefore made David swear again, because he loved him; for he loved him as his own soul.

(1 Samuel 20:18) 
Jonathan also said to him: "Tomorrow is the new moon festival, and you will be missed."

(1 Samuel 20:19) 
"Indeed, your seat will be empty. On the third day, you must hurry and come to the place where you hid yourself on the day of the appointed meeting, and you will sit by the stone whose name is Ezel."

(1 Samuel 20:20) 
"And I will shoot three arrows beside it, as if I were shooting at a target."

(1 Samuel 20:21) 
"Behold, I will send a boy, saying to him, 'Go, fetch me the arrows.' If I say to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are within reach of you, pick them up,' then you come to me. For there is peace for you, and no harm is intended, as the Lord lives."

(1 Samuel 20:22) 
"But if I speak thus to the boy: 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' then go quickly, because the Lord has sent you away."

(1 Samuel 20:23) 
"And concerning this word, which we have spoken, you and I, may the Lord be between me and you forever."

(1 Samuel 20:24) 
So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon festival day came, the king sat down to eat bread.

(1 Samuel 20:25) 
The king sat in his customary place, which was by the wall. Jonathan rose, and Abner sat at Saul's side, but David's place appeared empty.

(1 Samuel 20:26) 
And Saul said nothing on that day, because he supposed that something had happened by chance, that perhaps David was not ritually clean nor purified.

(1 Samuel 20:27) 
But when the second day after the new moon festival dawned, David was still absent from the king's table. Saul then said to Jonathan, his son: "Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, neither yesterday nor today?"

(1 Samuel 20:28) 
Jonathan answered Saul: "David earnestly requested me to let him go to Bethlehem."

(1 Samuel 20:29) 
"He said: 'Let me go, because there is a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I will go quickly and see my brothers.' For this reason, he has not come to the king's table."

(1 Samuel 20:30) 
Then Saul became angry with Jonathan and said to him: "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman, do I not know that you love the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame and disgrace of your mother?"

(1 Samuel 20:31) 
"For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now, therefore, send and bring him to me, for he is a son deserving of death."

(1 Samuel 20:32) 
Jonathan answered Saul, his father, and said: "Why should he die? What has he done?"

(1 Samuel 20:33) 
Then Saul raised his spear against Jonathan to strike him. And Jonathan understood that his father was determined to kill David.

(1 Samuel 20:34) 
So Jonathan rose from the table in furious anger and did not eat bread on the second day of the new moon festival meal. For he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.

(1 Samuel 20:35) 
When morning dawned, Jonathan came into the field according to David's word, and a small boy was with him.

(1 Samuel 20:36) 
He said to his boy: "Go, fetch me the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond the boy.

(1 Samuel 20:37) 
So the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot. And Jonathan cried out after the boy's back, saying: "Behold, the arrow is beyond you!"

(1 Samuel 20:38) 
And Jonathan cried out after the boy's back, saying: "Hurry quickly, do not stand still!" So the boy of Jonathan gathered the arrows and brought them to his master.

(1 Samuel 20:39) 
However, the boy knew absolutely nothing of the matter; only Jonathan and David understood the secret plan.

(1 Samuel 20:40) 
Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said to him: "Go, carry them into the city."

(1 Samuel 21:1) 
David then arrived in Nob, where he met Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech was surprised to see David and he asked him: 'Why are you alone? Is no one else with you?'

(1 Samuel 21:2) 
David responded to Ahimelech the priest, saying: 'The king has given me a secret order, and he said to me: “No one is to know about the mission I am on, or what I commanded you.” So I sent my young men to a certain place and told them to hide there.'

(1 Samuel 21:3) 
Now, if you have any provisions on hand, please give me something. Even five loaves of bread would be enough, or whatever you can find.

(1 Samuel 21:4) 
The priest answered David, saying: 'I don’t have any ordinary bread here. I only have the consecrated bread—the Bread of the Presence. You may have it only if your young men are ritually pure, especially if they have abstained from contact with women.'

(1 Samuel 21:5) 
David answered the priest, saying: 'Indeed, as for women, we have kept ourselves from them since yesterday and the day before, ever since we departed. My young men are ritually clean. Furthermore, even if this particular journey made us unclean, it will be made holy today by our commitment to holiness.'

(1 Samuel 21:6) 
So Achimelech gave him the Bread of the Presence, because there was no other bread there except for that Bread of the Presence, which had been removed from before the Lord so that fresh, hot bread could be put in its place.

(1 Samuel 21:7) 
Now, one of Saul’s servants happened to be there that day, confined in the tabernacle of the Lord. His name was Doëg the Idumaean, and he was in charge of Saul’s many camels.

(1 Samuel 21:8) 
David then said to Ahimelech: 'Do you have a spear or a sword here on hand? For I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s mission required haste.'

(1 Samuel 21:9) 
The priest replied: 'The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it, take it, for there is no other sword here except this one.' David then exclaimed: 'There is none like it! Give it to me!'

(1 Samuel 21:10) 
So David rose and fled that day from Saul. He went to King Achis of Gath.

(1 Samuel 21:11) 
King Achis’s servants said to him: 'Isn’t this David, the king of his land? Isn’t he the one people sang about in their dances, saying: 'Saul has struck down a thousand, and David ten thousand!''

(1 Samuel 21:12) 
David took these words to heart and became very afraid of King Achis of Gath.

(1 Samuel 21:13) 
So he changed his behavior in front of them and pretended to be mad while in their hands. He scratched on the doors of the city gate, and his saliva ran down his beard.

(1 Samuel 21:14) 
King Achis then said to his servants: 'Look, you can see this man is insane. Why have you brought him to me?'

(1 Samuel 21:15) 
'Do we not have enough madmen of our own that you should bring this one to me? Is this fellow to enter my house?'

(1 Samuel 21:16) 
David therefore departed from there and fled to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.

(1 Samuel 21:17) 
And everyone who was in distress, or overwhelmed by debt, or bitter in spirit, gathered to him. He became their leader, and about four hundred men were with him.

(1 Samuel 21:18) 
David then went from there to Mizpah of Moab and said to the king of Moab: 'Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.'

(1 Samuel 21:19) 
And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him for all the days that David was in the stronghold.

(1 Samuel 21:20) 
Then Gad the prophet said to David: 'Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.' So David departed and went to the forest of Hereth.

(1 Samuel 21:21) 
Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. Saul himself was then staying in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the high place in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.

(1 Samuel 21:22) 
Saul then said to all his servants who stood around him: 'Listen now, you sons of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of a thousand and commanders of a hundred?'

(1 Samuel 21:23) 
'For all of you have conspired against me, and no one tells me why my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse. And there is no one among you who pities me or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait for me, as is clear today.'

(1 Samuel 21:24) 
But Doëg the Idumaean, who was standing with Saul’s servants, answered and said: 'I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub the priest.'

(1 Samuel 21:25) 
'He consulted the Lord for him, and gave him bread, and also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.'

(1 Samuel 21:26) 
So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the house of his father, the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.

(1 Samuel 21:27) 
Saul then said: 'Listen, son of Ahitub!' He answered: 'Here I am, my lord.'

(1 Samuel 21:28) 
And Saul said to him: 'Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God for him, so that he would rise up against me as an ambush, even to this very day.'

(1 Samuel 21:29) 
Ahimelech answered the king, saying: 'And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is also the king’s son-in-law? He carries out your commands and is honored in your house.'

(1 Samuel 21:30) 
'Did I only begin to consult God for him today? Far be it from me! Let not the king suspect anything against his servant, or against all the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing at all of this, neither more nor less.'

(1 Samuel 21:31) 
And the king said: 'You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all the house of your father!'

(1 Samuel 21:32) 
The king then said to the guards standing around him: 'Go, and kill the priests of the Lord! Because their hand is with David, and knowing that he had fled, they did not inform me.' But the king’s servants were unwilling to lay their hands on the priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 21:33) 
Then the king said to Doëg: 'You turn and kill the priests!' And Doëg the Idumaean turned and himself killed the priests. He slaughtered on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.

(1 Samuel 21:34) 
And Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword—men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep—all by the edge of the sword.

(1 Samuel 21:35) 
However, one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled to David.

(1 Samuel 21:36) 
And he reported to David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 21:37) 
And David said to Abiathar: 'I knew on that day, when Doëg the Idumaean was there, that he would surely report it to Saul. I am responsible for the loss of all the lives in your father’s house.'

(1 Samuel 21:38) 
'Stay with me, do not be afraid. For wherever my life goes, your life will go with me.'

(1 Samuel 21:39) 
Then David was informed, saying: 'Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are plundering the threshing floors!'

(1 Samuel 21:40) 
So David consulted the Lord, saying: 'Shall I go and strike down these Philistines?' And the Lord said to David: 'Go, strike down the Philistines, and save Keilah.'

(1 Samuel 21:1) 
David therefore came to Nob to see Achimelech, the high priest. Achimelech was startled when David arrived, and he said to him, 'Why are you all by yourself? Why is there no one with you?'

(1 Samuel 21:2) 
David said to Achimelech the high priest, 'The king has given me a secret mission and told me: 'No one is to know about the mission I have sent you on, nor the instructions I have given you.' I have also arranged for my young men to meet me at a specified location.'

(1 Samuel 21:3) 
Now then, if you have any food available, give me at least five loaves of bread, or whatever else you can find.

(1 Samuel 21:4) 
The priest answered David, saying, 'I don't have any ordinary bread available, but only the holy showbread, which is consecrated to God. Are the young men pure, especially from having been with women?'

(1 Samuel 21:5) 
David answered the high priest, saying, 'Indeed, as for women, we have kept ourselves from them since we began our journey yesterday and the day before. The young men's bodies have been kept ritually pure. Normally, our journey would be defiled, but even our mission will be considered holy today because of the sacred nature of our work, as long as our bodies remain pure.'

(1 Samuel 21:6) 
So the high priest gave David the holy bread because there was no other bread available there. It was only the showbread, which had been taken from before the Lord's presence in the tabernacle, so that fresh, hot bread could be put in its place.

(1 Samuel 21:7) 
Now, on that very day, one of Saul's servants was present there inside the tabernacle of the Lord. His name was Doëg the Edomite, and he was the chief over Saul's many herdsmen.

(1 Samuel 21:8) 
Then David said to Achimelech, 'Do you have a spear or a sword here that I can take? I didn't bring my own sword or my weapons with me, because the king's mission was too urgent for any delays.'

(1 Samuel 21:9) 
The high priest replied, 'Look, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod. If you want to take it, then take it, for there is no other sword here. Only that one.' David then exclaimed, 'There is no other sword like it! Give it to me!'

(1 Samuel 21:10) 
So David then got up and fled that very day from King Saul's presence. He went to Achish, who was the king of Gath.

(1 Samuel 21:11) 
But the servants of King Achish said to him, 'Is this not David, who is like a king in his own land? Was it not to this very man that they sang in the dances, saying: 'Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands?'

(1 Samuel 21:12) 
David took these words seriously and stored them in his heart, and he became very afraid of King Achish of Gath.

(1 Samuel 21:13) 
So David changed his behavior in front of them and feigned madness while they held him. He began to scribble on the city gate doors, and his saliva ran down his beard.

(1 Samuel 21:14) 
Achish then said to his servants, 'Look, you can see the man is mad! Why have you brought him to me?'

(1 Samuel 21:15) 
'Do I not have enough madmen of my own that you would bring this man here to act like a lunatic in front of me? Should such a man be allowed into my royal residence?'

(1 Samuel 21:16) 
So David fled from Gath and came to the cave of Adullam.

(1 Samuel 22:1) 
So David fled from Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all of his father's household heard of his hiding place, they went down to him there.

(1 Samuel 22:2) 
Everyone who was in a difficult situation, burdened by debt, or bitter in spirit gathered to him. And David became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.

(1 Samuel 22:3) 
From there, David went to Mizpah in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother stay here with you, until I know what God will do for me" —seeking protection for his parents in his ancestral homeland.

(1 Samuel 22:4) 
So David left them with the king of Moab, and his parents remained there with the king all the time David was in his places of refuge.

(1 Samuel 22:5) 
But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in this place of refuge. Leave immediately and go into the land of Judah." So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.

(1 Samuel 22:6) 
Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. At that time, Saul was staying in Gibeah, sitting under a prominent tree in the grove near Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.

(1 Samuel 22:7) 
He said to his servants who stood around him, "Listen now, you sons of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse—David—give all of you fields and vineyards, and make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?"

(1 Samuel 22:8) 
"You have all conspired against me, and no one informs me that my own son, Jonathan, has made a covenant with the son of Jesse! Is there no one among you who feels for my cause, or who will tell me that my son has stirred up my own servant David against me, inciting him to lie in ambush for me even to this very day?"

(1 Samuel 22:9) 
But Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's servants who was standing there, answered, "I saw the son of Jesse—David—in Nob with Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub."

(1 Samuel 22:10) 
"Ahimelech consulted the Lord on David's behalf, gave him provisions, and also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."

(1 Samuel 22:11) 
So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub, and for all his father's household—all the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.

(1 Samuel 22:12) 
And Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub." Ahimelech responded, "Here I am, my lord."

(1 Samuel 22:13) 
Saul then said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, David? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God on his behalf, so that he might rise up against me as an ambusher even to this very day!"

(1 Samuel 22:14) 
Ahimelech responded to the king, saying, "Who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is also the king's son-in-law, obedient to your command, and held in honor in your own household. He is above reproach."

(1 Samuel 22:15) 
"Have I only just today begun to consult the Lord on his behalf? Absolutely not! Let not the king suspect his servant, nor any of my father's household, of any wrongdoing. For I, your servant, knew nothing at all about this matter, neither great nor small."

(1 Samuel 22:16) 
Then the king declared, "You will surely die, Ahimelech—you and all of your father's household."

(1 Samuel 22:17) 
Then the king said to the guards who were standing around him, "Turn and kill the priests of the Lord! Their hands are with David, for they knew he had fled but did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to raise their hands to strike down the priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 22:18) 
Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and attack the priests!" So Doeg the Edomite turned, attacked the priests, and on that day killed eighty-five men who wore the sacred linen ephod.

(1 Samuel 22:19) 
Nob, the city of the priests, was also utterly destroyed by the sword. Doeg put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep—everything in the city.

(1 Samuel 22:20) 
But one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.

(1 Samuel 22:21) 
Abiathar informed David that Saul had murdered the priests of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 22:22) 
David said to Abiathar, "I knew it that day! When Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would undoubtedly report everything to Saul. I am responsible for the deaths of everyone in your father's household."

(1 Samuel 22:23) 
"Stay with me; do not be afraid. For whoever seeks my life also seeks your life, and you will be safe here with me."

(1 Samuel 22:1) 
David then left that place, and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's entire household heard about this, they went down to join him there.

(1 Samuel 22:2) 
All those who were in distress gathered around him, all who were burdened by any kind of debt or trouble, and all who felt their lives were bitter; and David became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him.

(1 Samuel 22:3) 
From there, David went to Mizpah in Moab, and he said to the king of Moab: "Please allow my father and my mother to stay with you, until I know what God will do for me."

(1 Samuel 22:4) 
So David left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him for all the days that David was in his stronghold.

(1 Samuel 22:5) 
Then Gad the prophet said to David: "Do not remain in this stronghold; depart and go into the land of Judah." So David left and came into the forest of Hereth.

(1 Samuel 22:6) 
Now Saul heard that David had been discovered, along with the men who were with him. At that time, Saul was staying in Gibeah, sitting under a tamarisk tree on a high place in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.

(1 Samuel 22:7) 
Saul said to his servants who stood around him: "Listen, I beg you, sons of Jemini! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards, and make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?

(1 Samuel 22:8) 
Why have all of you conspired against me? No one among you reports to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse. No one among you grieves for me or informs me that my son has incited my servant to ambush me, as he has done even to this very day."

(1 Samuel 22:9) 
Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there and was the chief among Saul's servants, answered and said: "I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, the high priest.

(1 Samuel 22:10) 
Ahimelech consulted the Lord for him, and also gave him provisions and even the sword of Goliath the Philistine."

(1 Samuel 22:11) 
So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for his father's entire household, the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.

(1 Samuel 22:12) 
Saul said: "Listen, son of Ahitub!" And he answered: "I am ready, my lord."

(1 Samuel 22:13) 
Saul said to him: "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God for him, so that he might rise up against me as an enemy, as an ambusher, even to this day?"

(1 Samuel 22:14) 
Ahimelech answered the king, saying: "And who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law, always ready to obey your command, and honored in your own household!

(1 Samuel 22:15) 
Is this the first time I began consulting God for him? Absolutely not! Let the king not suspect anything against his servant, nor against my father's entire household; for your servant knew nothing about this matter, neither little nor much."

(1 Samuel 22:16) 
And the king said: "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all of your father's household!"

(1 Samuel 22:17) 
Then the king said to his bodyguards, who stood around him: "Turn around and kill the priests of the Lord, because their loyalty is with David; they knew he had fled, yet they did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to raise their hands against the Lord's priests.

(1 Samuel 22:18) 
So the king said to Doeg: "You turn, and fall upon the priests!" And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, killing on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod, a sacred garment worn by priests.

(1 Samuel 22:19) 
He also struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, killing men and women, children and nursing infants, as well as oxen, donkeys, and sheep, all by the edge of the sword.

(1 Samuel 22:20) 
However, one son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.

(1 Samuel 22:21) 
He reported to David that Saul had killed the Lord's priests.

(1 Samuel 22:22) 
David said to Abiathar: "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely report it to Saul. I am responsible for the loss of all the lives of your father's household.

(1 Samuel 22:23) 
Stay with me; do not be afraid. For whoever seeks my life will also seek your life, and with me, you will be safe."

(1 Samuel 23:1) 
Then people brought news to David, saying: "Listen! The Philistines are attacking Keilah, and they are looting the threshing floors."

(1 Samuel 23:2) 
So David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go and strike down these Philistines?" And the Lord said to David: "Go, and you will strike down the Philistines, and you will save Keilah."

(1 Samuel 23:3) 
But the men who were with David said to him: "Look, we are afraid even here in Judah. How much more will we be afraid if we go to Keilah and face the armies of the Philistines?"

(1 Samuel 23:4) 
So David again consulted the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said: "Rise up, and go to Keilah, because I will deliver the Philistines into your hand."

(1 Samuel 23:5) 
Therefore David and his men went to Keilah, and he fought against the Philistines, and he drove off their livestock, and he struck them with a great slaughter; and so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

(1 Samuel 23:6) 
Now it happened that when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to David in Keilah, he was carrying the ephod in his hand.

(1 Samuel 23:7) 
And it was reported to Saul that David had come to Keilah, and Saul said: "God has delivered him into my hands, for he is shut in, having entered a city that has gates and bars."

(1 Samuel 23:8) 
And Saul commanded all the people to go down to war in Keilah and to besiege David and his men.

(1 Samuel 23:9) 
However, David, when he knew that Saul was secretly preparing evil against him, said to Abiathar the priest: "Bring the ephod here."

(1 Samuel 23:10) 
And David said: "O Lord God of Israel, Your servant has heard the report that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city on account of me."

(1 Samuel 23:11) 
"Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hands? And will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell Your servant."

(1 Samuel 23:12) 
And the Lord said: "They will deliver you."

(1 Samuel 23:13) 
So David and his men, about six hundred of them, rose up and went out from Keilah, and they wandered about, uncertain where to go. And it was reported to Saul that David had fled from Keilah, so he halted his journey.

(1 Samuel 23:14) 
But David remained in the wilderness, in very fortified places; he also remained on the desert mountain of Ziph. So Saul searched for him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hands.

(1 Samuel 23:15) 
And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. Now David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in the forest.

(1 Samuel 23:16) 
Then Jonathan, Saul's son, rose up and went to David in the forest, and he strengthened David's hand in God, and said to him:

(1 Samuel 23:17) 
"Do not be afraid, for the hand of Saul my father will not seize you. You will reign over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."

(1 Samuel 23:18) 
So David and Jonathan made a covenant before the Lord. And David remained in the forest, but Jonathan returned to his home.

(1 Samuel 23:19) 
Now the Ziphites went up from David to Saul in Gibeah, saying: "Is not David hiding among us in the very strongholds in the forest, on the hill of Hachilah, which is to the right of the desert?"

(1 Samuel 23:20) 
"Now then, if your soul desires to come down, come down. It is our duty to deliver him into the king's hands."

(1 Samuel 23:21) 
And Saul said: "May you be blessed by the Lord, because you have felt sorrow for my plight."

(1 Samuel 23:22) 
"Go therefore, and prepare yourselves, and find out and carefully observe the place where he stays, or who has seen him; or if he is truly there, let someone make me know his exact location."

(1 Samuel 23:23) 
"Observe closely and know all the hiding places in which he hides, and return to me at a certain place, so that I may go with you. For if he is in the land, I will search for him among all the thousands of Judah."

(1 Samuel 23:24) 
So they rose up and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. But David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain to the right of Jeshimon.

(1 Samuel 23:25) 
So Saul and his companions went down to search. And when this was reported to David, he went down to the rock and remained in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon.

(1 Samuel 23:26) 
And Saul went on one side of this mountain, and David with his men on the other side of that mountain. Now David was hurrying to flee from Saul, and Saul with his army was encircling David and his men to capture them.

(1 Samuel 23:27) 
Then a messenger came to Saul, saying: "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have raided the land!"

(1 Samuel 23:28) 
So Saul returned and stopped pursuing David. For this reason, they called that place "The Dividing Rock."

(1 Samuel 23:29) 
Therefore David went up from there and remained in the strongholds of En-Gedi.

(1 Samuel 24:1) 
Now it happened that when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, a message was brought to him, saying: 'Indeed, David is in the wilderness of Engedi!'

(1 Samuel 24:2) 
So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all of Israel and went to seek out David and his men, going as far as the most rugged rocks, where the wild goats dwell.

(1 Samuel 24:3) 
And he came to the sheepfolds that were along the way, and there was a cave there. Saul entered it to relieve himself. Now, David and his men were hiding in the inner parts of the cave, deep inside.

(1 Samuel 24:4) 
And David's men said to him: 'Behold, this is the very day of which the Lord spoke to you, saying: 'I will deliver your enemy into your hand, so that you may do to him whatever seems right in your eyes!'' Therefore, David rose up and quietly cut off the hem of Saul's cloak.

(1 Samuel 24:5) 
After this, David's conscience struck him, because he had cut off the hem of Saul's cloak, recognizing it as a disrespectful act against God's anointed.

(1 Samuel 24:6) 
And he said to his men: 'May the Lord be merciful to me, that I should not do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, by laying my hand on him. For he is the Christ—the anointed one—of the Lord!'

(1 Samuel 24:7) 
And David restrained his men with these words, and he did not permit them to rise up against Saul. Meanwhile, Saul rose from the cave and continued on his way.

(1 Samuel 24:8) 
However, David also rose after him and, coming out of the cave, he cried out behind Saul, saying: 'My lord, O King!'

(1 Samuel 24:9) 
And Saul looked behind him. Then David bowed himself with his face to the ground and worshipped, showing profound respect.

(1 Samuel 24:10) 
And David said to Saul: 'Why do you listen to the words of men who speak and say: 'Behold, David seeks your harm?' These are false accusations.

(1 Samuel 24:11) 
Behold, today your own eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you into my hand in the cave. I considered killing you, but my eye spared you; I had compassion on you.

(1 Samuel 24:12) 
And I said: 'I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Christ—the anointed one—of the Lord!'

(1 Samuel 24:13) 
Look rather, my father, and acknowledge this hem of your cloak in my hand. For when I cut off your hem, I refused to lay my hand on you.

(1 Samuel 24:14) 
Understand this, and see that there is no evil in my hand, nor injustice, nor any sin on my part, and I have committed no offense against you. Yet you lie in wait for my very life, to take it away.

(1 Samuel 24:15) 
May the Lord judge between me and you, and may the Lord avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you. I will not take justice into my own hands.

(1 Samuel 24:16) 
Just as the old proverb says: 'Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.' But my hand shall not be against you.

(1 Samuel 24:17) 
Whom are you pursuing, O King of Israel? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, or a single flea? These are insults, showing how little of a threat I am.

(1 Samuel 24:18) 
May the Lord be judge, and may He judge between me and you. May He see and decide my cause, and deliver me from your hand.

(1 Samuel 24:19) 
Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said: 'Is this your voice, my son David?'

(1 Samuel 24:20) 
And Saul raised his voice and wept aloud.

(1 Samuel 24:21) 
And he said to David: 'You are more righteous than I, for you have rendered good to me, while I have rendered evil to you.'

(1 Samuel 24:22) 
For you have shown today the good things you have done for me: how the Lord delivered me into your hand, and yet you did not kill me.

(1 Samuel 24:23) 
For no one finds his enemy and lets him go on a good way; instead, may the Lord repay you for the good you have done to me today.

(1 Samuel 25:1) 
Samuel died, and all Israel gathered and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramatha. David then got up and went down into the desert of Paran.

(1 Samuel 25:2) 
There was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. This man was extremely rich; he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was in Carmel for the shearing of his flock.

(1 Samuel 25:3) 
The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. She was a very prudent and good woman, but her husband was a harsh and wicked man. He was of the lineage of Caleb.

(1 Samuel 25:4) 
David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep.

(1 Samuel 25:5) 
So David sent ten young men, and said to them: 'Go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, ask him in my name how he fares and wish him peace.'

(1 Samuel 25:6) 
And say this: 'Live well, my brother, and may all things prosper for you, for your whole household, and for all that is yours.'

(1 Samuel 25:7) 
'I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us in the desert; we never harmed them, nor was anything lost from them all the days they were with us in Carmel.'

(1 Samuel 25:8) 
'Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore, may my young men find favor in your eyes. Since we have come on a good day, please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'

(1 Samuel 25:9) 
When David's young men came, they spoke all these words to Nabal in David's name, and then they waited in silence.

(1 Samuel 25:10) 
Nabal answered David's servants, saying: 'Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today there are many servants who are running away from their masters!'

(1 Samuel 25:11) 
'Therefore, shall I take my bread, my water, and the meat which I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I do not even know where they come from?'

(1 Samuel 25:12) 
So David's young men turned back on their way, and when they came, they reported all of Nabal's words to him.

(1 Samuel 25:13) 
And David said to his men: 'Let each one gird on his sword.' And each one girded on his sword. David also girded on his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.

(1 Samuel 25:14) 
However, one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying: 'Behold, David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master; but he drove them away with insults.'

(1 Samuel 25:15) 
'And these men were very good to us. They did not afflict us, nor was anything taken from us all the time we were with them in the desert.'

(1 Samuel 25:16) 
'They were like a protective wall to us both night and day, all the days we were with them, while our shepherds were pasturing the sheep.'

(1 Samuel 25:17) 
'Therefore, know now and consider what you should do. For evil is determined against our master and against your whole household. Our master Nabal is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him, so you must act.'

(1 Samuel 25:18) 
So Abigail quickly prepared and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five roasted sheep, five measures of parched corn, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them upon donkeys.

(1 Samuel 25:19) 
And she said to her young men: 'Go on ahead of me; behold, I will follow you.' But she did not tell her husband Nabal about this.

(1 Samuel 25:20) 
As Abigail rode on her donkey and was coming down under the cover of the mountain, David and his men appeared, coming down towards her, and she met them.

(1 Samuel 25:21) 
Now David had been saying to his men: 'Truly, it was in vain that I guarded all that belonged to this man in the desert, and that nothing was lost of all that pertains to him. For he has returned evil to me for good.'

(1 Samuel 25:22) 
'May God do this to David's enemies, and more also, if by morning I leave alive even one male belonging to Nabal, even one who pisses against a wall' —meaning not a single male would survive to urinate on the walls of their home, ensuring total destruction.

(1 Samuel 25:23) 
When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and she fell before David on her face and prostrated herself on the ground in supplication.

(1 Samuel 25:24) 
And she fell at his feet and said: 'Let this iniquity be upon me alone, my lord. I beg you, let your handmaid speak in your hearing, and please listen to the words of your handmaid.'

(1 Samuel 25:25) 
'Please, my lord, do not take to heart this worthless man Nabal. For as his name is, so he is: 'Nabal' means 'fool,' and foolishness is indeed with him. As for me, your handmaid, I did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.'

(1 Samuel 25:26) 
'Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, the Lord has restrained you from shedding blood and has saved your hand from taking vengeance for yourself. And now, let your enemies and those who seek evil for my lord become like Nabal.'

(1 Samuel 25:27) 
'And now, accept this gift, which your handmaid has brought to you, my lord, and give it to the young men who follow you.'

(1 Samuel 25:28) 
'Please forgive the offense of your handmaid. For the Lord will surely make a faithful and enduring house for my lord, because you fight the battles of the Lord, and no evil has been found in you all the days of your life.'

(1 Samuel 25:29) 
'If indeed a man should rise up to pursue you and seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound up in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God, held securely in His protection. But the lives of your enemies, He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling in a whirlwind, scattering them to destruction.'

(1 Samuel 25:30) 
'When therefore the Lord has done for my lord all the good things He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you leader over Israel —meaning when you become king—'

(1 Samuel 25:31) 
'This will not be a cause for stumbling or a pang of regret in your heart, my lord, that you would have shed blood without cause, or avenged yourself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, you will remember your handmaid.'

(1 Samuel 25:32) 
And David said to Abigail: 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, and blessed be your counsel.'

(1 Samuel 25:33) 
'And blessed be your wisdom, and blessed are you, who have prevented me this day from going to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.'

(1 Samuel 25:34) 
'Otherwise, as the Lord God of Israel lives, Who has restrained me from doing evil to you: had you not come quickly to meet me, surely by morning, Nabal would not have been left with even one male who pisses against a wall, ensuring total annihilation.'

(1 Samuel 25:35) 
So David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and he said to her: 'Go in peace to your house. Behold, I have heard your voice and respected your plea.'

(1 Samuel 25:36) 
So Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, there was a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry, because he was excessively drunk. So she did not tell him anything at all until the morning.

(1 Samuel 25:37) 
But in the morning, when Nabal had sobered up from the wine, his wife told him these things. And his heart died within him from shock, and he became like a stone.

(1 Samuel 25:38) 
And it happened, after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.

(1 Samuel 25:39) 
When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: 'Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil, and has returned Nabal's wickedness upon his own head.' So David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her to himself as a wife.

(1 Samuel 25:40) 
So David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying: 'David has sent us to you, to take you to himself as a wife.'

(1 Samuel 25:1) 
Samuel died, and all of Israel gathered together and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. David then rose up and went down into the wilderness of Paran.

(1 Samuel 25:2) 
There was a man in the highlands of Maon whose property was in Carmel, and that man was exceedingly wealthy. He had three thousand sheep and one thousand goats, and it so happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

(1 Samuel 25:3) 
The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was a very prudent and good woman. Her husband, however, was hard-hearted and evil, and he was a descendant of Caleb.

(1 Samuel 25:4) 
David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.

(1 Samuel 25:5) 
So David sent ten young men and told them: “Go up to Carmel and approach Nabal. Greet him on my behalf with good wishes and peace.”

(1 Samuel 25:6) 
And this is what you are to say: 'May you live long and prosper, and may your household and all that belongs to you also prosper.'

(1 Samuel 25:7) 
'I have just heard that your shepherds are shearing. Do you have my shepherds in Carmel — (meaning, those who have been protecting your flock)?'

(1 Samuel 25:8) 
'They — (my men who have been protecting your flock) — will not be put to shame. Your young men ask you to give whatever you find to your servants and to your son David.'

(1 Samuel 25:9) 
'We have come on a good day. Whatever is at hand, please give it to your servants and to your son David.'

(1 Samuel 25:10) 
So when the young men arrived, they conveyed all these words to Nabal in David’s name, and then they fell silent, waiting for his response.

(1 Samuel 25:11) 
Nabal answered David’s servants, saying: “Who is this David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, many servants are running away from their masters. — (I won't help such men).”

(1 Samuel 25:12) 
“Am I then to take my bread, my water, and the meat that I have slaughtered for those who are shearing my flock, and give it to men of whom I do not know where they come from? Absolutely not.”

(1 Samuel 25:13) 
So David’s young men turned back and reported all of Nabal’s words to him.

(1 Samuel 25:14) 
Then David said to his young men: “Let each man strap on his sword!” And each man strapped on his sword. David himself also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred remained behind to guard the supplies.

(1 Samuel 25:15) 
But one of Nabal’s young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: “Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master — (respectfully and with good intent) — but he violently lashed out at them.”

(1 Samuel 25:16) 
“Yet, they were very good men. They caused us no trouble at all, nor did they take anything from our possessions during all the days they were with us when we were in the field.”

(1 Samuel 25:17) 
“They were a wall of protection for us, day and night, throughout all the days we were with them while we were shepherds of the sheep.”

(1 Samuel 25:18) 
“Therefore, now consider and see what you must do, because evil is determined against our master and against all his household. For he himself is such a wicked and worthless man that no one can speak to him — (he will not listen to reason).”

(1 Samuel 25:19) 
So Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two wineskins of wine, five cooked sheep — (rams) — five measures of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and she loaded them onto donkeys.

(1 Samuel 25:20) 
She said to her young men: “Go ahead of me; behold, I will follow behind you.” But she did not tell her husband, Nabal, about any of this.

(1 Samuel 25:21) 
As she was riding on the donkey and descending by a hidden path of the mountain, David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.

(1 Samuel 25:22) 
Now David had just said: “Surely, it was for nothing that I guarded all this man’s possessions in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that belonged to him. Yet he has repaid me evil for good.”

(1 Samuel 25:23) 
“May God do so to David’s enemies, and more also, if by morning I leave a single male alive from all that belongs to him.”

(1 Samuel 25:24) 
When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from her donkey and fell down at David’s feet, bowing low to the ground in reverence and supplication.

(1 Samuel 25:25) 
She fell at his feet and said: “Upon me alone, my lord, let this iniquity fall. I beg you, let your servant speak in your hearing, and please listen to the words of your handmaid.”

(1 Samuel 25:26) 
“Please, my lord, do not take to heart this worthless man, Nabal. For according to his name, he is a fool — (Nabal means 'fool') — and folly is with him. But I, your servant, did not see the young men whom you sent.”

(1 Samuel 25:27) 
“Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, it is the Lord who has restrained you from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand. Now let your enemies and those who seek evil for my lord be like Nabal — (worthless and overcome by divine judgment).”

(1 Samuel 25:28) 
“May this blessing, which your servant has brought to you, my lord, be given to your servants who follow you.”

(1 Samuel 25:29) 
“Please forgive the iniquity of your servant. For the Lord will surely make a lasting and faithful house for my lord, because you fight the battles of the Lord, and good things have been found in you all the days of your life.”

(1 Samuel 25:30) 
“If a man rises up to pursue you and seek your life, the life of my lord will be guarded as in a bundle of the living with the Lord your God. But the lives of your enemies will be hurled away like a stone from a sling.”

(1 Samuel 25:31) 
“When the Lord has done for my lord all the good things He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you leader over Israel, then this will not be a cause for stumbling or a troubled conscience for my lord — (the thought) — that you shed blood needlessly or avenged yourself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”

(1 Samuel 25:32) 
David said to Abigail: “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me, and blessed be your counsel!”

(1 Samuel 25:33) 
“And blessed be your wisdom, and blessed be you, who have restrained me today from going to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.”

(1 Samuel 25:34) 
“Otherwise, as surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who has kept me from doing evil to you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, there would not have been left to Nabal by morning light a single male person — (meaning, every male in his household would have been destroyed).”

(1 Samuel 25:35) 
Then David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and he said to her: “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice and I have shown you favor.”

(1 Samuel 25:36) 
Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry, for he was exceedingly drunk. So she did not tell him anything at all until the morning.

(1 Samuel 25:37) 
But in the morning, when Nabal had sobered up from his wine, his wife told him these things. And his heart died within him, and he became like a stone — (paralyzed by fear or a stroke).

(1 Samuel 25:38) 
And about ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.

(1 Samuel 25:39) 
When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: “Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil. He has returned Nabal’s wickedness upon his own head.” So David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.

(1 Samuel 25:40) 
David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel and spoke to her, saying: “David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife.”

(1 Samuel 26:1) 
But the Ziphites came from the wilderness to Saul, saying: 'Look! David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the wilderness.'

(1 Samuel 26:2) 
So Saul got up and went down into the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were three thousand men, chosen from Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.

(1 Samuel 26:3) 
Saul made his camp on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the wilderness, by the road. But David was living in the wilderness at that time, and seeing that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,

(1 Samuel 26:4) 
David sent out scouts, and learned with certainty that Saul had indeed come.

(1 Samuel 26:5) 
So David got up and went to the place where Saul was. He saw the exact place where Saul was sleeping, and Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, and Saul sleeping inside his tent, while the rest of the people were encamped all around him.

(1 Samuel 26:6) 
David then said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying: 'Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?' And Abishai said: 'I will go down with you.'

(1 Samuel 26:7) 
So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and they found Saul lying down and sleeping in his tent, and his spear was stuck in the ground at his head. But Abner and the people were sleeping all around him.

(1 Samuel 26:8) 
Then Abishai said to David: 'God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Therefore, now I will pierce him with his own spear into the ground, just once, and a second time will not even be needed!'

(1 Samuel 26:9) 
And David said to Abishai: 'Do not kill him; for who can stretch out his hand against the Anointed of the Lord and be innocent?'

(1 Samuel 26:10) 
And David said: 'As the Lord lives! Unless the Lord strikes him down himself, or his day comes for him to die naturally, or he goes down into battle and perishes there;'

(1 Samuel 26:11) 
'Far be it from me to stretch out my hand against the Anointed of the Lord! Now then, take the spear that is at his head, and the jug of water, and let us go.'

(1 Samuel 26:12) 
So David took the spear and the jug of water that was at Saul's head, and they left. And there was no one who saw, or understood what was happening, or woke up; instead, all of them were sleeping, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.

(1 Samuel 26:13) 
When David had crossed to the other side of the valley, and had come to the top of a distant mountain, so that there was a great distance between them,

(1 Samuel 26:14) 
David called out to the people and to Abner, son of Ner, saying: 'Won't you answer, Abner?' And Abner answered and said: 'Who are you, who calls out and disturbs the king?'

(1 Samuel 26:15) 
And David said to Abner: 'Are you not a man of valor? And who is like you in all of Israel? Why then did you not guard your lord the king? For one of the people came in to kill your lord the king!'

(1 Samuel 26:16) 
'This thing that you have done is not good! As the Lord lives, you are men worthy of death, because you did not guard your lord, the Anointed of the Lord! Now then, look where the king's spear is, and where the jug of water was, which was at his head!'

(1 Samuel 26:17) 
And Saul recognized David's voice and said: 'Is this your voice, my son David?' And David said: 'It is my voice, my lord, O King!'

(1 Samuel 26:18) 
And David said: 'Why does my lord pursue his servant? What have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?'

(1 Samuel 26:19) 
'Now therefore, please hear, my lord the King, the words of your servant: If the Lord is inciting you against me, then let Him accept an offering. But if it is men who are doing this, then let them be cursed in the sight of the Lord! For they have driven me out today from living in the inheritance of the Lord, by saying: "Go, serve other gods!"'

(1 Samuel 26:20) 
'And now, let my blood not be poured out on the ground away from the presence of the Lord; for you have come out to search for a single flea, just as one pursues a partridge in the mountains.'

(1 Samuel 26:21) 
And Saul said: 'I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will never again seek to harm you, because my life was precious in your eyes today. I have acted foolishly, and have greatly erred.'

(1 Samuel 26:22) 
And David answered and said: 'Here is the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it.'

(1 Samuel 26:23) 
'And the Lord will repay to each person according to his righteousness and his faithfulness, because I was unwilling to stretch out my hand against the Anointed of the Lord.'

(1 Samuel 26:24) 
'And just as your life was valued greatly today in my eyes, so may my life be valued greatly in the eyes of the Lord, and may He deliver me from all trouble.'

(1 Samuel 26:25) 
And Saul said to David: 'Blessed are you, my son David! For indeed, you will certainly do great things, and you will surely prevail!' So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his own place.

(1 Samuel 26:1) 
Then the Ziphites came to Saul in Gibeah, saying: "Is David not hiding himself on the hill of Hachila, which is opposite the desert wilderness?"

(1 Samuel 26:2) 
So Saul arose and went down into the desert of Ziph, and with him were three thousand chosen men from Israel, to search for David in the desert of Ziph.

(1 Samuel 26:3) 
And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachila, which is opposite the desert wilderness, by the road. But David was living in the desert. Therefore, David saw that Saul had come after him into the desert.

(1 Samuel 26:4) 
So David sent out scouts, and he learned for certain that Saul had indeed come.

(1 Samuel 26:5) 
Then David arose and came to the place where Saul was. When David saw the place where Saul was sleeping, and Abner the son of Ner, who was the commander of his army, Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp, and Abner and the others were all around him.

(1 Samuel 26:6) 
And David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying: "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" And Abishai said: "I will go down with you."

(1 Samuel 26:7) 
So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and they found Saul lying down and sleeping in the camp, with his spear fixed in the ground at his head. But Abner and the people were sleeping all around him.

(1 Samuel 26:8) 
And Abishai said to David: "God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore, I will pin him to the ground with the spear once, and I will not need a second blow."

(1 Samuel 26:9) 
But David said to Abishai: "Do not kill him. For who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of the Lord and remain innocent?"

(1 Samuel 26:10) 
And David said: "As the Lord lives, either the Lord will strike him down, or his day will come for him to die, or he will perish by going down into battle."

(1 Samuel 26:11) 
May the Lord be merciful to me, that I may not stretch out my hand against the anointed of the Lord. Now therefore, take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go.

(1 Samuel 26:12) 
So David took the spear and the jug of water that was at Saul’s head, and they departed. And no one saw or understood or was awake, for they were all sleeping, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.

(1 Samuel 26:13) 
When David had crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain far away, with a great distance between them:

(1 Samuel 26:14) 
David cried out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: "Do you not answer, Abner?" And Abner answered and said: "Who are you who cries out and disturbs the king?"

(1 Samuel 26:15) 
And David said to Abner: "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to kill your lord the king."

(1 Samuel 26:16) 
This thing that you have done is not good. As the Lord lives, you are men deserving of death, because you have not guarded your lord, the anointed of the Lord. Now therefore, look where the king’s spear is, and where his jug of water was, which was at his head.

(1 Samuel 26:17) 
Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said: "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said: "It is my voice, my lord the king."

(1 Samuel 26:18) 
And he added, saying: "For what reason does my lord pursue his servant? What have I committed? Or what evil is in my hand?"

(1 Samuel 26:19) 
Now therefore, please hear, my lord the king, the words of your servant: "If the Lord stirs you up against me, let an offering be pleasing to Him. But if men have done this, may they be cursed in the sight of the Lord, for they have driven me out today from dwelling in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: 'Go, serve foreign gods.'"

(1 Samuel 26:20) 
And now, let not my blood be shed on the ground before the Lord. For you have come out to seek my life, as one pursues a leopard in the mountains.

(1 Samuel 26:21) 
And Saul said: "I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will never again seek your life, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and I have made many great errors."

(1 Samuel 26:22) 
And David answered and said: "Behold the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it."

(1 Samuel 26:23) 
And the Lord will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, because I was unwilling to put forth my hand against the anointed of the Lord.

(1 Samuel 26:24) 
And just as your life was valued greatly in my eyes today, so may my life be valued greatly in the eyes of the Lord, and may He deliver me from all trouble.

(1 Samuel 26:25) 
Then Saul said to David: "Blessed are you, my son David. You will surely accomplish great things, and you will certainly prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his own place.

(1 Samuel 27:1) 
But David said to himself: 'Eventually, I will be killed by Saul. Wouldn't it be better for me to escape and find safety in the land of the Philistines? Then Saul will give up hope and stop pursuing me throughout all the territory of Israel. This way I will escape from his power.'

(1 Samuel 27:2) 
So David got up and went, along with his six hundred men, to Achish, the son of Maoch, who was the king of Gath.

(1 Samuel 27:3) 
David lived with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his own household. David brought his two wives, Achinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, who had been Nabal's wife from Carmel.

(1 Samuel 27:4) 
When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer tried to find him.

(1 Samuel 27:5) 
Then David said to Achish: 'If I have found favor in your sight, please give me a place in one of the towns in this region where I can live. Why should your servant remain with you here in the royal capital?'

(1 Samuel 27:6) 
So on that very day, Achish gave him Ziklag. This is why Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah even to this present day.

(1 Samuel 27:7) 
The total time David lived in the territory of the Philistines was one year and four months.

(1 Samuel 27:8) 
David and his men would go up and raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. These were the peoples who had lived in that land from ancient times, all the way from Shur to the land of Egypt.

(1 Samuel 27:9) 
David would attack the entire land, leaving no man or woman alive. He would take the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and clothing, then return and come back to Achish.

(1 Samuel 27:10) 
Achish would ask, 'Where did you raid today?' David would answer, 'Against the south of Judah, or against the south of the Jerahmeelites, or against the south of the Kenites.'

(1 Samuel 27:11) 
David would not spare a single man or woman to bring them back to Gath, reasoning: 'Otherwise, they might speak against us and reveal what David truly did.' This was David’s practice for all the time he lived in the land of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 27:12) 
So Achis believed David, thinking: 'He has truly made himself detestable to his own people, Israel, and so he will be my servant forever.'

(1 Samuel 28:1) 
It happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel. And Achis said to David: "Know this for sure, you and your men will go out with me into the camp."

(1 Samuel 28:2) 
And David said to Achis: "Now you will see what your servant can do." And Achis said to David: "Then I will make you the guardian of my life for all time."

(1 Samuel 28:3) 
Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all of Israel mourned for him. They buried him in his city, Ramah. And Saul had removed the mediums and diviners from the land.

(1 Samuel 28:4) 
So the Philistines gathered and came and set up camp in Shunem. Saul also gathered all of Israel and came to Gilboa.

(1 Samuel 28:5) 
And Saul saw the Philistine camp and was greatly afraid; his heart was utterly terrified.

(1 Samuel 28:6) 
So he consulted the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him—not through dreams, nor through priests, nor through prophets.

(1 Samuel 28:7) 
And Saul said to his servants: "Find me a woman who possesses a spirit of divination, so I can go to her and consult through her." And his servants said to him: "There is a woman with a spirit of divination in Endor."

(1 Samuel 28:8) 
So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes. He went with two men, and they came to the woman at night. He said to her: "Divine for me using your spirit, and bring up for me whomever I tell you."

(1 Samuel 28:9) 
And the woman said to him: "Behold, you know what Saul has done, and how he has removed the mediums and diviners from the land. Why then are you setting a trap for my life, so that I may be killed?"

(1 Samuel 28:10) 
And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying: "As the Lord lives, no harm will come to you because of this matter."

(1 Samuel 28:11) 
And the woman said to him: "Whom shall I bring up for you?" And he said: "Bring up Samuel for me."

(1 Samuel 28:12) 
But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice and said to Saul: "Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul!"

(1 Samuel 28:13) 
And the king said to her: "Do not be afraid. What did you see?" And the woman said to Saul: "I saw divine beings ascending from the earth."

(1 Samuel 28:14) 
He said to her: "What is his appearance?" And she said: "An old man is ascending, and he is wrapped in a cloak." Then Saul understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself to the ground and worshipped.

(1 Samuel 28:15) 
But Samuel said to Saul: "Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?" And Saul said: "I am in great distress because the Philistines are fighting against me. Moreover, God has departed from me and will no longer hear me, neither through the hand of prophets nor through dreams. Therefore, I have called you to show me what I should do."

(1 Samuel 28:16) 
And Samuel said: "Why do you ask me, since the Lord has departed from you and has gone over to your neighbor?"

(1 Samuel 28:17) 
For the Lord will do to you exactly as He spoke through me: He will tear the kingdom from your hand and give it to your neighbor, David.

(1 Samuel 28:18) 
Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord, nor did you carry out His fierce anger against Amalek—for this reason, the Lord has done to you what you are suffering now.

(1 Samuel 28:19) 
And the Lord will also give Israel, along with you, into the hand of the Philistines. Therefore, tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me, and the Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 28:20) 
Immediately, Saul fell full length upon the ground, for he was greatly terrified because of Samuel's words. And he had no strength in him because he had not eaten any food all that day.

(1 Samuel 28:21) 
So the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly distressed. And she said to him: "Behold, your handmaid obeyed your voice, and I risked my life to listen to the words you spoke to me."

(1 Samuel 28:22) 
Now therefore, you also obey the counsel of your handmaid. Let me place a morsel of bread before you. Eat it so you may be refreshed and able to travel.

(1 Samuel 28:23) 
But he refused and said: "I will not eat." However, his servants and the woman compelled him, and at last he listened to their voice. He rose from the ground and sat upon the couch.

(1 Samuel 28:24) 
Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house. She hurried and killed it, then she took flour and mixed it and baked unleavened bread under the ashes.

(1 Samuel 28:25) 
And she set it before Saul and before his servants. They ate, and then they rose and traveled that same night.

(1 Samuel 28:1) 
It happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel. Achis then said to David: 'You must know for certain that you and your men will go out with me in the battle camp.'

(1 Samuel 28:2) 
And David said to Achis, 'Now you will see what your servant is able to do.' Achis then said to David, 'Then I will keep you as my personal guard and protect your life every day.'

(1 Samuel 28:3) 
Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all of Israel mourned for him. They buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had previously removed all the mediums and diviners from the land.

(1 Samuel 28:4) 
So the Philistines gathered and came to encamp in Shunem. But Saul also gathered all of Israel, and they came to Gilboa.

(1 Samuel 28:5) 
And when Saul saw the Philistine camp, he became terrified, and his heart was overwhelmed with fear.

(1 Samuel 28:6) 
So he consulted the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him—neither through dreams, nor through the priests using the Urim and Thummim, nor through prophets.

(1 Samuel 28:7) 
Then Saul said to his servants, 'Search for a woman who has a familiar spirit, and I will go to her to inquire through her.' His servants then told him, 'There is a woman with a familiar spirit in Endor.'

(1 Samuel 28:8) 
So Saul changed his appearance and put on other clothes. Then he, with two men, went and came to the woman by night. And he said to her, 'Perform divination for me by your familiar spirit, and bring up for me the one I will tell you.'

(1 Samuel 28:9) 
And the woman said to him, 'Look, you know what Saul has done and how he has removed the mediums and diviners from the land. Why then are you setting a trap for my life, that I may be killed?'

(1 Samuel 28:10) 
And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, 'As the Lord lives, no harm will come to you because of this matter.'

(1 Samuel 28:11) 
Then the woman said, 'Whom shall I bring up for you?' And he replied, 'Bring up Samuel for me.'

(1 Samuel 28:12) 
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. She said to Saul, 'Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!'

(1 Samuel 28:13) 
And the king said to her, 'Do not be afraid. What did you see?' And the woman said to Saul, 'I saw a divine being ascending from the earth.'

(1 Samuel 28:14) 
Then he said to her, 'What is his appearance like?' She replied, 'An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a cloak.' And Saul understood that it was Samuel. He then bowed himself to the ground and paid homage.

(1 Samuel 28:15) 
But Samuel said to Saul, 'Why have you disturbed me, causing me to be brought up?' Saul replied, 'I am in great distress. The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He has answered me nothing, neither through prophets nor through dreams. That is why I have called upon you, so you may show me what I am to do.'

(1 Samuel 28:16) 
And Samuel said, 'Why do you consult me, since the Lord has departed from you and has gone over to your neighbor, David?'

(1 Samuel 28:17) 
For the Lord will do to you exactly what He spoke through me. He will tear the kingdom from your hand and give it to your neighbor, David.

(1 Samuel 28:18) 
Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord, nor did you carry out His fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the Lord has done to you what you now suffer.

(1 Samuel 28:19) 
And the Lord will also give Israel, along with you, into the hand of the Philistines. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me in the realm of the dead. And the Lord will deliver the entire army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

(1 Samuel 28:20) 
Immediately, Saul fell full length to the ground, terrified by Samuel's words. He had no strength left in him, for he had eaten no food all that day and night.

(1 Samuel 28:21) 
So the woman came to Saul, seeing that he was greatly troubled. She said to him, 'Look, your handmaid obeyed your voice, and I risked my life by performing this for you, and I listened to your words that you spoke to me.'

(1 Samuel 28:22) 
Now, please listen to your handmaid's voice. Let me set a morsel of bread before you, and eat, so that you may regain your strength and be able to travel.

(1 Samuel 28:23) 
But he refused, saying, 'I will not eat.' However, his servants and the woman urged him strongly. At last, yielding to their persistence, he rose from the ground and sat upon the couch.

(1 Samuel 28:24) 
Now the woman had a fattened ox in her house. She quickly killed it and, taking flour, mixed it and baked unleavened bread under the ashes.

(1 Samuel 28:25) 
And she set it before Saul and his servants. When they had eaten, they rose and departed that very night.

(1 Samuel 29:1) 
So the Philistines gathered all their military companies and forces at Aphek, a strategic location for battle. Meanwhile, the army of Israel set up their camp by the spring located in Jezreel, another key tactical position.

(1 Samuel 29:2) 
The Philistine commanders were marching their troops, arrayed by companies of hundreds and thousands. David and his men were marching at the very rear, accompanying King Achis.

(1 Samuel 29:3) 
Then the Philistine commanders asked, 'Who are these Hebrews joining our ranks?' And Achis responded to the Philistine commanders, saying, 'Is this not David, who was a servant of King Saul of Israel? He has been with me for a long time, for days and years, and I have found no fault in him or any sign of disloyalty since he defected to me until this very day.'

(1 Samuel 29:4) 
However, the Philistine commanders became angry with Achis concerning David. They told him, 'Send this man away. Let him return to the place where you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle, lest he become our adversary during the fight. How else could he regain favor with his own master, Saul, except by turning against us and sacrificing the lives of these very men?'

(1 Samuel 29:5) 
They further questioned, 'Is this not the same David about whom they sang in their dances, saying: Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands?'

(1 Samuel 29:6) 
So Achis called David and said to him, 'As the Lord lives, you are upright, and you have been good in my sight. Your coming and going with me in the camp has been without issue. I have found nothing evil in you from the day you came to me until this very day. However, you do not please the other Philistine commanders.'

(1 Samuel 29:7) 
'Therefore, turn back now and go in peace. Do not displease the eyes of the Philistine commanders by remaining with us.'

(1 Samuel 29:8) 
David then said to Achis, 'What have I done? Or what fault have you found in your servant from the day I have been in your sight until this very day, that I should not come and fight against the enemies of my lord, the king?'

(1 Samuel 29:9) 
Achis answered David and said, 'I know that you are good in my eyes, as blameless as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have declared: He shall not go up with us into battle.'

(1 Samuel 29:10) 
'Therefore, depart early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord, the men who came with you. And when you have risen in the night and dawn begins to break, go your way.'

(1 Samuel 29:11) 
So David and his men rose early in the morning to depart at daybreak and return to the land of the Philistines. Meanwhile, the Philistines themselves marched up to Jezreel, ready for battle.

(1 Samuel 29:1) 
The Philistines gathered all their military divisions at Aphek. But Israel set up their camp by the spring in Jezreel.

(1 Samuel 29:2) 
The Philistine lords marched with their armies, organized into groups of hundreds and thousands. David and his men were bringing up the rear of the military column with Achish.

(1 Samuel 29:3) 
And the Philistine commanders said to Achish, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish replied to the Philistine commanders, "Is this not David, who was a servant of Saul, the king of Israel? He has been with me for many days, even years, and I have found nothing wrong in him since he defected to me, up until this very day."

(1 Samuel 29:4) 
Therefore, the Philistine commanders became angry with Achish and said to him, "Let the man go back and stay in the place where you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle, lest he become hostile towards us when we are engaged in battle. And how else could he appease his master, if not by turning against these very men of ours?"

(1 Samuel 29:5) 
"Is this not the David about whom they sang in their festive dances, saying: 'Saul has slain a thousand, but David has slain ten thousand'?"

(1 Samuel 29:6) 
So Achish called David and said to him, "As the Lord lives, you are upright and good in my sight. Your conduct, both your coming and going among us in the camp, has been above reproach. I have found nothing wrong in you from the day you came to me until this very day. But you are not pleasing to the Philistine commanders."

(1 Samuel 29:7) 
"Therefore, return and go in peace, so that you do not give offense to the Philistine commanders."

(1 Samuel 29:8) 
David then said to Achish, "What wrong have I done? Or what fault have you found in me, your servant, from the day I first came before you until this very day, that I should not be allowed to come and fight against the enemies of my lord, the king?"

(1 Samuel 29:9) 
Achish answered David, "I know you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders have plainly declared: 'He must not go up with us into battle.'"

(1 Samuel 29:10) 
"Therefore, rise early in the morning, you and your men who came with you. And as soon as you have risen while it is still dark, and then see the first light of day, you must depart."

(1 Samuel 29:11) 
So David and his men rose early that morning to depart from the land of the Philistines. The Philistines, for their part, advanced into Jezreel.

(1 Samuel 30:1) 
When David and his men arrived back at Ziklag on the third day, they found the city completely raided and burned to the ground by fire.

(1 Samuel 30:2) 
Their wives, sons, and daughters—both the young and the old—had been taken away as captives.

(1 Samuel 30:3) 
So David and all the people with him began to weep loudly, crying until they were completely exhausted and had no more tears left to shed.

(1 Samuel 30:4) 
Among those taken captive were David's two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, who had been Nabal's wife from Carmel.

(1 Samuel 30:5) 
David became terribly distressed because the people began to talk about stoning him, for everyone's spirit was bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord, his God.

(1 Samuel 30:6) 
Then David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, 'Bring me the ephod.' So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.

(1 Samuel 30:7) 
And David inquired of the Lord, saying, 'Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them or not?' The Lord replied to him, 'Pursue them: for you will surely overtake them and rescue everyone and everything.'

(1 Samuel 30:8) 
So David went, along with the six hundred men who were with him. And they came to the Wadi Besor, where some of the exhausted men rested there.

(1 Samuel 30:9) 
David continued the pursuit with four hundred men, while the two hundred who were too weary to cross the Wadi Besor remained behind.

(1 Samuel 30:10) 
They found an Egyptian man out in a field and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink,

(1 Samuel 30:11) 
They also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. After he ate, his spirit returned to him, and he was revived, because he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three full days and three full nights.

(1 Samuel 30:12) 
David then asked him, 'Whose servant are you? Where do you come from? And where are you going?' The Egyptian replied, 'I am a young Egyptian man, a servant of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago because I became ill.'

(1 Samuel 30:13) 
He continued, 'Indeed, we raided the Negev of the Cherethites, and the territory against Judah, and the territory against Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.'

(1 Samuel 30:14) 
David asked him, 'Can you lead me to this raiding party?' The Egyptian answered, 'If you swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, I will lead you to this party.'

(1 Samuel 30:15) 
So David swore to him. And the Egyptian led him, and there the raiders were, scattered across the entire open country, eating, and drinking, and celebrating as if it were a feast day, because of all the great plunder and spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.

(1 Samuel 30:16) 
And David attacked them from dawn until the evening of the next day, and not a single one of them escaped, except four hundred young men who had mounted camels and fled.

(1 Samuel 30:17) 
And David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, from his own wives down to the little ones. They had plundered absolutely nothing of the smaller or larger items, nor of the sons and daughters, nor of the spoil, nor of anything else they had carried off. David had brought everything back.

(1 Samuel 30:18) 
They also drove away all the flocks and herds. And concerning that plunder, they declared, 'This is David's plunder!'

(1 Samuel 30:19) 
When David returned, he came to the two hundred men who had been too weary to follow him, and whom he had made to stay by the Wadi Besor. They came out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him.

(1 Samuel 30:20) 
As David approached the people, he greeted them peacefully.

(1 Samuel 30:21) 
But every wicked and worthless man among the men who had gone with David responded, saying, 'Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any part of the plunder we recovered. Rather, let it be enough for each man to take his wife and children; when they have them, they can leave.'

(1 Samuel 30:22) 
But David said, 'My brothers, you must not do this with what the Lord has given us. He protected us, and delivered the raiders who attacked us into our hands.'

(1 Samuel 30:23) 
Nor should anyone listen to you concerning this matter: for the share will be equal for those who went down to the battle and for those who remained with the supplies. They shall divide it similarly.'

(1 Samuel 30:24) 
And it came to pass that, from that time and up to the present day, this was established as a statute, and a judgment, and a just custom in Israel.

(1 Samuel 30:25) 
So David came to Ziklag and sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, 'Accept this blessing from the Lord's plunder!'

(1 Samuel 30:26) 
He sent portions to those who were in Bethel, to those in Ramoth in the Negev, and to those in Jattir,

(1 Samuel 30:27) 
and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,

(1 Samuel 30:28) 
and to those in Racal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,

(1 Samuel 30:29) 
and to those in Hormah, and to those in Borashan, and to those in Athach,

(1 Samuel 30:30) 
and to those in Hebron, and to all the remaining places in which David himself and his men had lived and traveled.

(1 Samuel 30:1) 
When David and his men returned to Ziklag on the third day, they discovered that the Amalekites had launched a surprise attack into the southern region and Ziklag itself. The Amalekites had raided Ziklag, and they had set the entire place on fire.

(1 Samuel 30:2) 
They had also taken the women captive, and everyone else who was there—from the youngest child to the oldest person. They hadn't killed anyone, but they had taken them all away.

(1 Samuel 30:3) 
So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it had been burned down with fire. Their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.

(1 Samuel 30:4) 
Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they could no longer shed tears.

(1 Samuel 30:5) 
For David's two wives had also been taken captive: Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal the Carmelite's wife.

(1 Samuel 30:6) 
And David was greatly distressed, because the people were planning to stone him. For every man was bitter in his soul over his sons and his daughters. Yet, David strengthened himself in the Lord, his God.

(1 Samuel 30:7) 
Then David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, 'Bring me the ephod.' And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.

(1 Samuel 30:8) 
And David inquired of the Lord, saying, 'Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them, or not?' And the Lord said to him, 'Pursue them, because you will surely overtake them and rescue everyone.'

(1 Samuel 30:9) 
So David went, along with the six hundred men who were with him. They came as far as the Wadi Besor, where some of the men, exhausted, stayed behind.

(1 Samuel 30:10) 
But David pursued with four hundred men, for two hundred men had stayed behind because they were too weak and could not cross the Wadi Besor.

(1 Samuel 30:11) 
And they found an Egyptian man in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink,

(1 Samuel 30:12) 
And they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten these, his spirit returned to him and he was refreshed, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.

(1 Samuel 30:13) 
Then David said to him, 'Whose are you, and where are you from?' He replied, 'I am a young Egyptian man, a servant of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago.'

(1 Samuel 30:14) 
Indeed, we raided the southern region of the Cherethites, and against Judah, and the southern part of Caleb's territory, and we burned Ziklag with fire.

(1 Samuel 30:15) 
David asked him, 'Can you lead me to this raiding party?' He replied, 'Swear to me by God that you will not kill me, and that you will not hand me over to my master, and I will lead you to this raiding party.'

(1 Samuel 30:16) 
And he led him. And behold, they were spread out over the surface of the entire land, eating and drinking, and celebrating as if it were a festival, because of all the plunder and spoils they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.

(1 Samuel 30:17) 
And David struck them from dawn until the evening of the next day. No one escaped from them, except four hundred young men who mounted camels and fled.

(1 Samuel 30:18) 
And David rescued everything the Amalekites had taken. David also rescued his two wives.

(1 Samuel 30:19) 
And nothing was missing for them, from the least to the greatest, neither sons nor daughters, nor spoils, nor anything else they had stolen. David brought everything back.

(1 Samuel 30:20) 
And David took all the flocks and herds, and drove them before him. And the people said, 'This is David's plunder.'

(1 Samuel 30:21) 
Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to continue and had not been able to cross the Wadi Besor. They came out to meet David and the people who were with him. And when David approached the men, he greeted them peacefully.

(1 Samuel 30:22) 
Then every wicked and evil man among those who had gone with David responded, saying, 'Because they didn't go with us, we will give them nothing from the plunder we rescued. Let each man just take his wife and children and go away.'

(1 Samuel 30:23) 
But David said, 'You shall not do this, my brothers, after the Lord has saved us and delivered into our hands the raiders who attacked us.'

(1 Samuel 30:24) 
And no one will listen to you in this matter. For the share will be equal for the one who goes down to battle and the one who remains with the baggage. They shall divide it equally.

(1 Samuel 30:25) 
And from that day forward, this was established and commanded as a law, and it has set a standard of justice in Israel even to this present day.

(1 Samuel 30:26) 
When David returned to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, his close associates, saying, 'Receive a blessing from the Lord's plunder.'

(1 Samuel 30:27) 
To those in Bethel, and to those in Ramoth of the Negev (the southern region), and to those in Jattir,

(1 Samuel 30:28) 
And to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,

(1 Samuel 30:29) 
And to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,

(1 Samuel 30:30) 
And to those in Hormah, and to those in Bor-ashan, and to those in Athach,

(1 Samuel 30:31) 
And to those in Hebron, and in all the other places where David himself and his men had stayed.

(1 Samuel 31:1) 
The Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from the Philistines. Many of them were killed on Mount Gilboa.

(1 Samuel 31:2) 
The Philistines attacked Saul and his sons. They killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, all sons of Saul.

(1 Samuel 31:3) 
The battle raged fiercely around Saul. The archers, skilled with their bows, found him and wounded him severely with their arrows.

(1 Samuel 31:4) 
Saul said to his armor-bearer: "Draw your sword and kill me, so that these uncircumcised Philistines do not come and kill me and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer refused, because he was terrified by the great fear. So Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.

(1 Samuel 31:5) 
When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his own sword and died with him.

(1 Samuel 31:6) 
So Saul died, along with his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together on that day.

(1 Samuel 31:7) 
But the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond the Jordan River, saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead. They abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and settled in those places.

(1 Samuel 31:8) 
On the next day, the Philistines came to strip the bodies of the slain. They found Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.

(1 Samuel 31:9) 
They cut off Saul's head and stripped him of his armor. Then they sent messengers throughout the Philistine land to announce the news in the temples of their idols and to their people.

(1 Samuel 31:10) 
They placed Saul's armor in the temple of Astaroth, and they hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan.

(1 Samuel 31:11) 
But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,

(1 Samuel 31:12) 
all their valiant men rose up and marched all night. They took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. Then they came to Jabesh-Gilead and burned the bodies there.

(1 Samuel 31:13) 
And they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.
