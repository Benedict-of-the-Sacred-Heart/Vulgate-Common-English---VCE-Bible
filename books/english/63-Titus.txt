(Titus 1:1:1) 
Paul, a servant of God, and moreover an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith that God chose for His people, and according to the knowledge of the truth that leads to genuine godliness.

(Titus 1:1:2) 
This is all for the hope of eternal life, which God—He who cannot lie—promised even before the ages of time began.

(Titus 1:1:3) 
But at the proper time, God revealed His Word through the preaching that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:4) 
To Titus, my beloved son in our common faith: May grace and peace be with you from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.

(Titus 1:1:5) 
For this very purpose I left you behind in Crete: to set right what was still unfinished and to appoint priests—who are spiritual leaders—in every city, just as I instructed you.

(Titus 1:1:6) 
For a priest must be a man without blemish, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who are not accused of wild living or being disobedient.

(Titus 1:1:7) 
For a bishop—as God’s steward—must be without blemish; he must not be arrogant, not quick-tempered, not prone to much wine, not violent, and not greedy for dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:8) 
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, and self-controlled.

(Titus 1:1:9) 
He must hold fast to the faithful teaching that is in line with true doctrine, so that he may be able to encourage others with sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it.

(Titus 1:1:10) 
For there are many disobedient people, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially those who insist on circumcision.

(Titus 1:1:11) 
It is necessary to silence them, for they are overthrowing entire households by teaching things they ought not to, all for the sake of dishonest gain.

(Titus 1:1:12) 
One of their own, a prophet from among them, once said: 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.'

(Titus 1:1:13) 
This testimony is true. For this reason, you must rebuke them sharply so that they may become sound in the faith.

(Titus 1:1:14) 
They must no longer pay attention to Jewish fables and to the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

(Titus 1:1:15) 
To those who are pure, everything is pure. But to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, for both their mind and conscience are defiled.

(Titus 1:1:16) 
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:1) 
But you, Titus, must teach what is appropriate for sound, holy doctrine.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:2) 
Tell the older men to be sober, prudent, self-controlled, and sound in their faith, in their charity for others, and in their patience.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:3) 
Likewise, tell the older women to conduct themselves in a holy manner. They must not be slanderers, nor should they be enslaved to much wine, but rather they should be good teachers of what is right.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:4) 
This way, they can teach the younger women to be prudent and to love their husbands and their children,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:5) 
to be discreet, chaste, self-controlled, managing their households well, kind, and submissive to their own husbands. This way, the word of God will not be blasphemed or spoken ill of.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:6) 
Likewise, encourage the younger men to be self-controlled in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:7) 
In everything, you yourself, Titus, must set an example of good works for them. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, and seriousness,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:8) 
and let your message be sound and beyond reproach. This way, any opponent will be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us Christians.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:9) 
Tell servants to be submissive to their own masters in everything. They should be pleasing to them, not talking back,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:10) 
not stealing, but rather demonstrating complete trustworthiness in everything, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in all things.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:11) 
For the grace of God, our Savior, has appeared to all mankind,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:12) 
training us, the faithful, to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires. The grace of God teaches us to live soberly, justly, and piously in this present age,

(Titus 2:Titus 2:13) 
while we await the blessed hope: the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:14) 
He gave Himself for us, in order that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do good works.

(Titus 2:Titus 2:15) 
Say these things, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:1) 
Remind them to submit to the governmental rulers and the authorities, to always obey what is commanded by law, and to be ready and willing for every good work.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:2) 
Remind them not to speak evil of anyone, not to be quarrelsome but to be gentle, always showing perfect humility and kindness to all people.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:3) 
For at one time, we ourselves were also foolish and without understanding, disobedient to God's law, deceived by sin, enslaved to many kinds of earthly desires and corrupt pleasures, living lives full of malice and envy, hateful to others, and always hating one another.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:4) 
But then, the goodness of God and the loving kindness of our Divine Savior, Our Lord Jesus Christ, was fully revealed to us.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:5) 
He saved us, not because of any righteous deeds that we ourselves had done, but solely according to His own great mercy. He saved us through the life-giving washing of Baptism, which is the renewal and rebirth given by the Holy Spirit.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:6) 
God poured out this same Holy Spirit on us in abundance, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:7) 
This was so that, having been justified and made righteous by His grace and favor, we might become true heirs to His promises, holding the certain hope of eternal life.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:8) 
This is a most trustworthy saying. And concerning these things, I want you to teach and insist constantly, so that those who truly believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good works. These are indeed good and truly profitable things for all mankind.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:9) 
But avoid foolish questions and pointless debates, and endless genealogies, and quarrels and legal disputes over the Law; for these things are useless and completely worthless.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:10) 
As for a man who promotes heresy and division within the Church, after you have warned him once and then a second time, have nothing more to do with him or his teachings.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:11) 
You should know that a person like this is thoroughly corrupted and is actively sinning, because he stands condemned by his own self-chosen judgment and his rejection of the truth.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:12) 
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis as quickly as possible, for I have made plans to spend the winter there.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:13) 
Diligently help Zenas, who is an expert in the Law, and Apollos on their journey, making sure that they lack nothing they might need.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:14) 
And let our Christian people also learn to devote themselves to doing good works, especially for urgent and necessary needs, so that they will not be unproductive or useless in their faith.

(Titus 3:Titus 3:15) 
Everyone who is with me here sends their greetings to you. Greet all those who love us because of our shared faith in Christ. May the grace and divine favor of God be with all of you always. Amen.
