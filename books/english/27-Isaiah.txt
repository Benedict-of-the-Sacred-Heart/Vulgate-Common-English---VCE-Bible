(Isaiah 1:1) 
This is the vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah.

(Isaiah 1:2) 
Listen, universe. Listen, Earth, for the Lord has spoken. “I have raised up children, but they have rejected me.”

(Isaiah 1:3) 
The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel doesn't know me, and my people haven't understood me.

(Isaiah 1:4) 
Woe to the sinful nation, to a people burdened with iniquity, to the evil seed, to the wicked sons! They have forsaken the Lord, blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, and turned back.

(Isaiah 1:5) 
Why will you be struck again, since you are adding to your sin? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is heavy.

(Isaiah 1:6) 
From the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds, bruises, and open sores that are not bound up or softened with oil.

(Isaiah 1:7) 
Your land is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. In your presence, foreigners devour your land, and it is desolate as though destroyed by enemies.

(Isaiah 1:8) 
And the daughter of Zion will be left like a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city that is destroyed.

(Isaiah 1:9) 
Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have been like Sodom, and like Gomorrah.

(Isaiah 1:10) 
Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom. Give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.

(Isaiah 1:11) 
“What are your many sacrifices to me?” says the Lord. “I am full of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts, and I don’t want the blood of calves, lambs, or goats.”

(Isaiah 1:12) 
When you come before me, who has required this of you, that you tread my courts?

(Isaiah 1:13) 
Don’t offer any further sacrifice in vain. Incense is an abomination to me. New moons, sabbaths, and other festivals I cannot endure. Your iniquity and your gatherings!

(Isaiah 1:14) 
Your new moons and your appointed feasts, my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.

(Isaiah 1:15) 
And when you stretch out your hands, I will turn my eyes away from you. And when you multiply your prayer, I will not hear, for your hands are full of blood.

(Isaiah 1:16) 
Wash yourselves, be clean. Remove the evil of your thoughts from before my eyes. Stop doing evil!

(Isaiah 1:17) 
Learn to do good. Seek judgment. Help the oppressed. Judge for the orphan. Defend the widow.

(Isaiah 1:18) 
“Come now, and let us reason together,” says the Lord. “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”

(Isaiah 1:19) 
If you are willing, and if you listen to me, you shall eat the good of the land.

(Isaiah 1:20) 
But if you are not willing, and provoke me to anger, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 1:21) 
How has the faithful city become a prostitute, full of judgment? Justice dwelt in her, but now murderers.

(Isaiah 1:22) 
Your silver has become dross, your wine is mixed with water.

(Isaiah 1:23) 
Your leaders are disloyal. They are companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes. They follow after rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, and the widow's case does not come before them.

(Isaiah 1:24) 
Therefore, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Woe! I will console myself over my adversaries and take vengeance on my enemies.”

(Isaiah 1:25) 
I will turn my hand against you, and I will melt your dross as with lye, and I will remove all your tin.

(Isaiah 1:26) 
I will restore your judges as they were at first, and your counselors as in the beginning. After that, you will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.

(Isaiah 1:27) 
Zion will be redeemed with judgment, and those who turn to her with righteousness.

(Isaiah 1:28) 
And the destruction of the wicked and sinners alike; and those who have forsaken the Lord will be consumed.

(Isaiah 1:29) 
For they will be ashamed of the idols, those things that they desired, and they will be ashamed of the groves which they have chosen.

(Isaiah 1:30) 
For they will be like an oak whose leaves wither, and like a garden whose water fails.

(Isaiah 1:31) 
And the strong will be like tow, and his work like a spark, and they will burn together, and there is no one to extinguish them.

(Isaiah 2:1) 
This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw regarding Judah and Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 2:2) 
In the end times, the mountain of the Lord's temple will be prepared, at the top of all the mountains, and will be raised above all hills. And all the nations will flow to it.

(Isaiah 2:3) 
And many people will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths.” For the law will come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 2:4) 
He will judge the nations and rebuke many people. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.

(Isaiah 2:5) 
O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.

(Isaiah 2:6) 
For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been filled with all sorts of wickedness like before. They are filled with fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and their young men are in league with foreigners.

(Isaiah 2:7) 
Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. Their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.

(Isaiah 2:8) 
Their land is filled with idols: the work of their hands, what their fingers have made.

(Isaiah 2:9) 
So man bows down, and the man is humbled, and you do not forgive them.

(Isaiah 2:10) 
Enter into the rock, and hide yourself in the dust, from the face of the fear of the Lord and from the glory of His majesty.

(Isaiah 2:11) 
The eyes of the proud men are humbled, and the loftiness of the men will be bowed down. And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

(Isaiah 2:12) 
For the day of the Lord of hosts will be against all who are proud and lofty, against everyone who is lifted up, and he will be humbled.

(Isaiah 2:13) 
And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lofty, and against all the oaks of Bashan,

(Isaiah 2:14) 
and against all the high mountains, and against all the elevated hills,

(Isaiah 2:15) 
and against every high tower, and against every fortified wall,

(Isaiah 2:16) 
and against all the ships of Tarshish and against everything that seems like a beautiful picture.

(Isaiah 2:17) 
So the loftiness of man will be bowed down, and the pride of men will be humbled. And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

(Isaiah 2:18) 
And the idols will utterly vanish.

(Isaiah 2:19) 
And men will enter into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth, from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He arises to strike the earth.

(Isaiah 2:20) 
In that day, a man will throw away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which he made for himself to worship moles and bats,

(Isaiah 2:21) 
so that he may enter the caverns of the rocks and the crevices of the cliffs, from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He arises to strike the earth.

(Isaiah 2:22) 
Therefore cease to be proud of man, in whose nostrils is breath, for he is esteemed, of what account is he?

(Isaiah 3:1) 
Behold, the Lord of hosts will take away all the bread and all the water that is needed to live from Jerusalem and Judah,

(Isaiah 3:2) 
He will remove their strong and brave soldiers, their judges, their prophets, their fortune-tellers, and their elders,

(Isaiah 3:3) 
their rulers, those held in high regard, their counselors, their skilled craftsmen, and those eloquent in speech.

(Isaiah 3:4) 
And I will make children their princes, and the immature will rule them.

(Isaiah 3:5) 
The people will be in chaos, one person against another, each against his neighbor. The child will insult the elder, and the vulgar will disrespect the noble.

(Isaiah 3:6) 
Surely a man will seize his brother in the house of his father, saying, “You have a cloak, so be our leader, and under your hand, let there be a sword.”

(Isaiah 3:7) 
In that day, he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a physician; for in my house there is no bread nor clothing. Do not make me the leader of the people.”

(Isaiah 3:8) 
For Jerusalem will fall, and Judah will be brought down, because their language and the foolishness of their deeds are against the Lord, provoking the eyes of His majesty.

(Isaiah 3:9) 
The expression on their faces testifies against them, and they proclaim their sin like Sodom, without hiding it. Woe to their souls, for they have brought evil upon themselves.

(Isaiah 3:10) 
Tell the just that it is well, because they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.

(Isaiah 3:11) 
Woe to the wicked! For the reward of his hands will be given to him.

(Isaiah 3:12) 
My people, those who bless you are deceiving you and turning the path of your footsteps upside down.

(Isaiah 3:13) 
The Lord stands in judgment, and He stands to judge the peoples.

(Isaiah 3:14) 
The Lord will come to judgment with the elders of His people and its princes, for you have consumed the vineyard, and the plunder of the poor is in your houses.

(Isaiah 3:15) 
Why do you crush my people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 3:16) 
And the Lord said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, walking with outstretched necks, ogling with their eyes, strutting as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,

(Isaiah 3:17) 
therefore the Lord will scrape the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will expose their hair.”

(Isaiah 3:18) 
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their sandals, the crescents, and the necklaces,

(Isaiah 3:19) 
the bracelets, the pendants, and the headbands, the anklets, the sashes, and the perfume bottles,

(Isaiah 3:20) 
the rings, the mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.

(Isaiah 3:21) 
Instead of perfume, there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of elaborate hairstyles, baldness; instead of a robe, a sackcloth.

(Isaiah 3:22) 
Your men will fall by the sword, and your strong ones in battle.

(Isaiah 3:23) 
And its gates will lament and mourn, and the land, desolated, will sit.

(Isaiah 3:24) 
And seven women will seize one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes; only let us be called by your name, take away our reproach.”

(Isaiah 3:25) 
In that day the Lord will take away the finery of their sandals, the crescents, the necklaces, and the pendants,

(Isaiah 3:26) 
the dresses, the cloaks, the veils, and the shawls.

(Isaiah 3:27) 
And there will be decay instead of fragrance, a rope instead of a belt, baldness instead of elaborate hairstyles, and a sackcloth instead of a robe.

(Isaiah 3:28) 
And the daughter of Zion will remain like a shelter in a vineyard, like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, and like a city that has been destroyed.

(Isaiah 4:1) 
And in that day, seven women will take hold of one man, saying: "We will eat our own bread, and dress ourselves in our own clothes; only let us be called by your name, and take away our disgrace."

(Isaiah 4:2) 
In that day, the Messiah will be the glory and honor of God, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and glory of those of Israel who are saved.

(Isaiah 4:3) 
And it will be that those who are left in Zion, and those who remain in Jerusalem, will be holy, all who are written in the book of life in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 4:4) 
When the Lord washes away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purges the blood of Jerusalem from within her, by the spirit of justice and the spirit of fire.

(Isaiah 4:5) 
The Lord will create a cloud by day and smoke by night over the whole area of Mount Zion, and over all its assemblies; the glory will be a defense for all.

(Isaiah 4:6) 
There will be a tent to provide shade from the heat of the day, and a place of refuge and a shelter from the storm and from the rain.

(Isaiah 5:1) 
I will sing to my Beloved a song of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My Beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.

(Isaiah 5:2) 
He enclosed it, and cleared the stones from it. He planted the best vines. He built a tower in the middle, and he built a wine press in it. He waited for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.

(Isaiah 5:3) 
So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.

(Isaiah 5:4) 
What more could I have done for my vineyard, that I have not done? Why did I wait for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes?

(Isaiah 5:5) 
Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down.

(Isaiah 5:6) 
I will make it desolate; it shall not be pruned, nor shall it be tilled. Thorns and thistles shall come up, and I will command the clouds not to rain upon it.

(Isaiah 5:7) 
For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are its chosen plants. I waited for judgment, but behold, oppression; and for justice, but behold, a cry.

(Isaiah 5:8) 
Woe to those who join house to house, and add field to field, so that you come to another's property. Will you alone dwell in the midst of the earth?

(Isaiah 5:9) 
In my ears, the Lord of hosts said, "Surely many houses shall be desolate, great and beautiful, without inhabitant.

(Isaiah 5:10) 
For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath of wine, and a bushel of seed shall yield only a quart.

(Isaiah 5:11) 
Woe to those who rise early in the morning to follow drunkenness, who linger over wine until late in the evening, and are inflamed by wine.

(Isaiah 5:12) 
In harp and lyre, tambourine and flute, and wine, are their works, but they do not regard the work of the Lord, nor do they consider the work of his hands.

(Isaiah 5:13) 
Therefore my people have been led captive, because they have no knowledge, and their glory is famished, and their multitude is dried up with thirst.

(Isaiah 5:14) 
Therefore hell has enlarged its soul, and opened its mouth without limit, and its glorious and famous people shall go down there.

(Isaiah 5:15) 
And the man shall be bowed down, and the mighty man shall be brought low, and the eyes of the proud shall be humbled.

(Isaiah 5:16) 
And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice.

(Isaiah 5:17) 
And the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat shall be for the wanderers.

(Isaiah 5:18) 
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with a cart rope.

(Isaiah 5:19) 
Who say, "Let him hasten, and let his work come quickly, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!"

(Isaiah 5:20) 
Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

(Isaiah 5:21) 
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

(Isaiah 5:22) 
Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink!

(Isaiah 5:23) 
Who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the justice of the just!

(Isaiah 5:24) 
Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, so their root shall be rottenness, and their flower shall go up like dust in the wind: because they have despised the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 5:25) 
Therefore the anger of the Lord has been kindled against his people, and he has stretched out his hand against them, and struck them, and the mountains were troubled, and they were made as corpses in the middle of the streets.

(Isaiah 5:26) 
For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.

(Isaiah 5:27) 
He will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and he will whistle to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they will come quickly, swiftly.

(Isaiah 5:28) 
There is none who is weary or stumbles among them; none will slumber or sleep. Nor will the belt of their loins be untied, nor the strap of their sandals be broken.

(Isaiah 5:29) 
Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hooves of their horses are like flint, and the wheels of their chariots are like a whirlwind.

(Isaiah 5:30) 
Their roaring is like a lion, and they will roar; and they will snarl like lions. They will roar like the sea, and if you look at the land, behold, there is darkness of distress, and the light is darkened in its gloom.

(Isaiah 6:1) 
In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on His throne, high and lifted up; and the temple was filled with the train of His robe.

(Isaiah 6:2) 
Above Him stood the Seraphim: each one had six wings; with two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.

(Isaiah 6:3) 
And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory."

(Isaiah 6:4) 
And the doorposts of the temple shook at the voice of the one crying out, and the house was filled with smoke.

(Isaiah 6:5) 
Then I said: "Woe is me, for I have been silent, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!"

(Isaiah 6:6) 
Then one of the Seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.

(Isaiah 6:7) 
And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips, and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin will be purged."

(Isaiah 6:8) 
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said: "Here I am, send me."

(Isaiah 6:9) 
And He said: "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'"

(Isaiah 6:10) 
Harden the hearts of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and I heal them."

(Isaiah 6:11) 
And I said: "How long, O Lord?" And He said: "Until the cities are laid waste, without inhabitants, and the houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate."

(Isaiah 6:12) 
And the Lord will take away the people, and there will be much left in the midst of the land.

(Isaiah 6:13) 
And if there is still a tenth part left in it, it will return, and it will be consumed, as a terebinth and as an oak that casts its root in the earth, the holy seed will stand in it.

(Isaiah 7:1) 
When Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to fight against it, but they couldn't conquer it.

(Isaiah 7:2) 
The news came to the house of David that the Syrians were allied with Ephraim. The heart of the king was disturbed, and the heart of his people was disturbed, just as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.

(Isaiah 7:3) 
Then the Lord said to Isaiah: "Go out to meet King Ahaz, you and your son, near the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the fuller's field."

(Isaiah 7:4) 
Say to him, 'Be careful, and keep calm. Don't be afraid, and don't let your heart be troubled by the two smoldering stumps of these firebrands, in the fury of Rezin, the Syrians, and the son of Remaliah.'

(Isaiah 7:5) 
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying:

(Isaiah 7:6) 
'Let us go against Judah, and weaken it, and divide it, and take it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in its midst.'

(Isaiah 7:7) 
Thus says the Lord God: "It shall not stand, and it shall not happen."

(Isaiah 7:8) 
Because the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin, and within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be so broken that it will no longer be a people.

(Isaiah 7:9) 
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. Unless you believe, you will not endure."

(Isaiah 7:10) 
The Lord then spoke again to Ahaz, saying:

(Isaiah 7:11) 
"Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God, either in the depths below or in the heights above."

(Isaiah 7:12) 
But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not test the Lord."

(Isaiah 7:13) 
Then Isaiah said: "Hear now, O house of David: Is it not enough for you to be wearying to men, that you are also wearying to God?

(Isaiah 7:14) 
Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call His name Emmanuel.

(Isaiah 7:15) 
He shall eat butter and honey, so that He may know how to reject evil and choose good.

(Isaiah 7:16) 
For before the Child knows how to refuse evil and choose good, the land which you dread shall be forsaken by the face of its two kings.

(Isaiah 7:17) 
The Lord will bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your father's house, days that have not come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah--the king of the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 7:18) 
In that day, the Lord will whistle for the fly that is in the farthest parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

(Isaiah 7:19) 
They will come, and they will all rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorns, and on all pastures.

(Isaiah 7:20) 
In that day, the Lord will shave with a hired razor, those who are beyond the River, with the king of Assyria's hand, the head, and the hair of the feet, and will take away the beard.

(Isaiah 7:21) 
And it shall be in that day, that a man shall feed a young cow, and two sheep.

(Isaiah 7:22) 
And because of the abundance of milk they give, he will eat butter, because butter and honey will be eaten by everyone who is left in the land.

(Isaiah 7:23) 
And it shall be in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand silver coins, shall be for thorns and briers.

(Isaiah 7:24) 
With arrows and bows they will come there, because all the land will be thorns and briers.

(Isaiah 7:25) 
And on all the mountains that are cultivated with a hoe, you will not fear thorns and briers, but they will be for grazing cattle and for the treading of sheep.

(Isaiah 8:1) 
And the Lord said to me: “Get a big book, and write on it with a human stylus: ‘Quick to plunder, hurry to take spoils.’”

(Isaiah 8:2) 
I called reliable witnesses to myself, including Uria the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah.

(Isaiah 8:3) 
I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: “Call his name, ‘Quick spoils, hurry to take spoils.’”

(Isaiah 8:4) 
Because before the child knows how to say ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ the power of Damascus will be taken away, along with the spoils of Samaria, before the king of the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 8:5) 
The Lord spoke to me again, saying:

(Isaiah 8:6) 
“Because this people has rejected the waters of Siloë, which flow quietly, and has embraced Rasin, and the son of Remaliah:

(Isaiah 8:7) 
for this reason, see, the Lord will bring upon them the strong and abundant waters of the river, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and it will rise over all its channels, and will flow over all its banks.

(Isaiah 8:8) 
And it will go through Judah, overflowing and passing through, even to the neck: and it will stretch out its wings, filling the breadth of your land, O Emmanuel.

(Isaiah 8:9) 
Be joined together, you peoples, and be overcome, and listen, all those far off: strengthen yourselves, and be overcome. Gird yourselves, and be overcome.

(Isaiah 8:10) 
Take counsel together, and it will be broken: speak a word, and it will not happen: for God is with us.

(Isaiah 8:11) 
For thus the Lord said to me with a strong hand, and taught me not to go the way of this people, saying:

(Isaiah 8:12) 
“Do not call it a conspiracy: for everything that this people speaks is a conspiracy: and do not fear their fear, nor be afraid.

(Isaiah 8:13) 
Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: let Him be your fear, and let Him be your terror.

(Isaiah 8:14) 
And He will become a sanctuary, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense to the two houses of Israel, a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 8:15) 
And many will stumble against them, and will fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

(Isaiah 8:16) 
Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

(Isaiah 8:17) 
And I will wait for the Lord, who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in Him.

(Isaiah 8:18) 
Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given to me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.

(Isaiah 8:19) 
And when they say to you: “Seek out those who consult spirits and diviners, who chirp and mutter in their incantations: should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the living from the dead?

(Isaiah 8:20) 
Turn to the law and the testimony. If they do not speak according to this word, they will have no dawn.

(Isaiah 8:21) 
And it will pass through it, oppressed and hungry: and when it is hungry, it will be angry, and will curse its king and its God, and will look up.

(Isaiah 8:22) 
And it will look to the earth, and see distress and darkness, gloom and anguish, and a darkness oppressing, and it will not be able to escape from the anguish.

(Isaiah 9:1) 
The people who were walking in darkness saw a great light: those who inhabited the region of the shadow of death, light arose for them.

(Isaiah 9:2) 
You multiplied the people, but You didn't increase their joy: they will rejoice before you, just as those who rejoice in the harvest, in the way victors exult with seized spoils.

(Isaiah 9:3) 
For the yoke of His burden, and the rod of His shoulder, and the rod of His oppressor, You have shattered, as in the day of Midian.

(Isaiah 9:4) 
Because all of the boots of the war are with tumult, and with blood, and with fire as fuel.

(Isaiah 9:5) 
For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Strong God, Father of the age to come, Prince of Peace.

(Isaiah 9:6) 
His government will be multiplied, and there will be no end of peace: He will sit upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to establish it and strengthen it in judgment and justice, from now on and forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

(Isaiah 9:7) 
The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it fell on Israel.

(Isaiah 9:8) 
All the people will know, Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, who in pride and arrogance of heart, say:

(Isaiah 9:9) 
The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with squared stones: the sycamores were cut down, but we will fill with cedars.

(Isaiah 9:10) 
And the Lord raised up the adversaries of Rasin over him, and roused up his enemies.

(Isaiah 9:11) 
Syria from the east, and the Philistines from the west: who devoured Israel with their whole mouth. In all these, His wrath is not turned away, but still His hand is outstretched.

(Isaiah 9:12) 
And the people have not turned back to Him who strikes them, nor have they sought the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 9:13) 
And the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, the elder and the younger, in one day: the head, the prophet, and the tail, the doctor of lies.

(Isaiah 9:14) 
And there were those who blessed this people, and there were those who were blessed by it: therefore those who bless you deceive you, and they destroy the way of your feet.

(Isaiah 9:15) 
Because of this, the Lord will not rejoice in His joy, and will not have mercy on His orphan: because of this, there will be those who will rejoice in his youth, and He will not have mercy on his widow.

(Isaiah 9:16) 
Because all the people and those who speak wickedness: in all these, His wrath is not turned away, but still His hand is outstretched.

(Isaiah 9:17) 
Because wickedness is kindled as a fire, it will devour thorns and briers, and it will burn the forests, and will envelop the smoke of the elevation.

(Isaiah 9:18)

(Isaiah 9:20) 
Manasseh against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, and both together against Judah. In all these, His wrath is not turned away, but still His hand is outstretched.

(Isaiah 10:1)

(Isaiah 10:3) 
What will you do in the day of visitation, and of the calamity coming from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?

(Isaiah 10:5) 
Woe to Assyria, the rod of my fury, and the staff in whose hand is my indignation.

(Isaiah 10:6) 
I will send him against a dissembling nation, and I will give him orders against the people of my wrath, to take away the spoils, and to seize the prey, and to tread him down like the mire of the streets.

(Isaiah 10:7) 
But he will not think this way, and his heart will not consider it this way: but it will be in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.

(Isaiah 10:8) 
For he says: “Are not my princes also kings?

(Isaiah 10:9) 
Is not Chalanon just like Carchemis? Is not Emath just like Arphan? Is not Samaria just like Damascus?

(Isaiah 10:10) 
Because he said, “My hand has made the kingdoms of idols, and their images which were in Jerusalem and in Samaria.”

(Isaiah 10:11) 
Shall I not, as I have done in Samaria and its idols, do the same in Jerusalem and its images?

(Isaiah 10:12) 
And it shall come to pass when the Lord has finished all His works on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of the eyes of his pride.

(Isaiah 10:20) 
And it will be in that day: the remnant of Israel, and those who will be saved from the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them: but they will rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

(Isaiah 10:21) 
A remnant will return, the remnant, I say, of Jacob, to the most powerful God.

(Isaiah 10:22) 
For if your people, Israel, will be as the sand of the sea, the remnant of them will return: a consummation that is decreed with justice will overflow.

(Isaiah 10:26) 
And the Lord of hosts will stir up a scourge against him according to the slaughter of Midian in the rock of Oreb: and his rod over the sea, and he will lift it up in the way of Egypt.

The Spirit of God will rest on him: a spirit of wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and power, a spirit of knowledge and love of God.

(Isaiah 11:3) 
He will be filled with fear and awe of God. He will not judge by mere appearances, nor decide by what he hears.

(Isaiah 11:4) 
He will judge with justice for the poor and decide with equity for the oppressed. He will strike the land with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.

(Isaiah 11:5) 
Righteousness will be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.

(Isaiah 11:6) 
The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the kid; the calf and the lion and the fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them.

(Isaiah 11:10) 
In that day the root of Jesse will stand as a signal for the peoples; the nations will seek him, and his resting place will be glorious.

(Isaiah 11:11) 
In that day the Lord will again lift his hand to recover the remnant of his people who are left from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea.

The Lord will utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt; he will wave his hand over the River [Euphrates] with his scorching wind, and will split it into seven streams, so that one can cross on foot.

(Isaiah 11:16) 
There will be a highway for the remnant of his people who are left from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.

(Isaiah 12:1) 
In that day, you will say, “I will give thanks to You, Lord, because though You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.”

(Isaiah 12:2)

They are coming from a faraway land, from the edge of the universe. The Lord and the instruments of his wrath will destroy the entire earth.

(Isaiah 13:6) 
Wail, for the day of the Lord is near, it will come like an unexpected disaster sent by the Almighty.

(Isaiah 13:7) 
Because of this, every hand will go limp, and every heart will be filled with sorrow.

(Isaiah 13:8) 
They will be terrified, and fear and pain will grip them. They will writhe in agony, like a woman giving birth. They will look in shock at each other; their faces will be aflame.

(Isaiah 13:9) 
Behold, the day of the Lord will come, a cruel day, filled with wrath and anger, to make the land a wasteland, and to destroy the sinners who live in it.

(Isaiah 13:10) 
The stars of the sky and their constellations will not give off their light. The sun will be darkened at its rising, and the moon will not shine.

(Isaiah 13:11) 
I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their sin. I will end the pride of the arrogant, and I will humble the arrogance of the mighty.

(Isaiah 13:12)

(Isaiah 13:18) 
Their bows will crush the young men. They will show no compassion for the fruit of the womb, nor will their eyes pity the children.

(Isaiah 13:19) 
Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed them.

(Isaiah 13:20) 
It will never be inhabited again, nor will it be rebuilt from generation to generation. No Arab will pitch his tent there, and no shepherds will rest there.

(Isaiah 13:21) 
But wild animals will rest there, and the houses will be filled with jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and hairy demons will leap around.

(Isaiah 13:22) 
Hyenas will howl in its fortresses, and wild dogs will howl in its luxurious palaces. Its time is almost here, and its days will not be prolonged.

(Isaiah 14:1) 
In the day when God gives you rest from your hard labor, and your wandering, and your harsh servitude, in which you formerly served,

(Isaiah 14:2) 
you will recite this parable against the king of Babylon, saying:

(Isaiah 14:3) 
“How has the oppressor ceased? The exactor, gone?

(Isaiah 14:4) 
The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers:

(Isaiah 14:5) 
who struck the peoples with an incurable wound in anger, who subdued the nations in fury, with an unceasing persecution.

(Isaiah 14:6) 
He struck peoples with an incurable wound, and subdued the nations with fury, with a persecution that never ceased.

(Isaiah 14:7) 
How have you fallen from the sky, O Lucifer, who rose in the morning? You have fallen to the earth, who wounded the nations?

(Isaiah 14:8) 
You said in your heart: “I will ascend into the sky, above the stars of God I will raise my throne, I will sit on the mountain of the covenant, on the sides of the north:”

(Isaiah 14:9) 
“I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the Most High.”

(Isaiah 14:10) 
Yet you will be brought down to hell, to the depths of the pit.

(Isaiah 14:11) 
Those who see you will gaze at you, and say: “Is this the man who troubled the earth, who moved kingdoms,

(Isaiah 14:12) 
who made the world a wilderness and destroyed cities, who did not open the prison to his bound ones?”

(Isaiah 14:13) 
All the kings of the nations have slept in glory, each in their own houses.

(Isaiah 14:14) 
But you are cast out of your tomb like an aborted branch, covered with the slain by the sword, and by those descending to the foundations of the pit, like a rotting corpse.

(Isaiah 14:15) 
You will not dwell with them in the tomb, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people: the seed of the wicked shall not be reckoned forever.

(Isaiah 14:16) 
Prepare slaughter for his sons, for the iniquity of their fathers, lest they rise, and inherit the land, and fill the face of the world with slaughter.

(Isaiah 14:17) 
And I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts, and I will destroy the name of Babylon, and its remnants, and its seed, and its offspring, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 14:18) 
And I will make it a possession for hedgehogs, and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 14:19) 
The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying: “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it be, and as I have planned, so shall it happen:

(Isaiah 14:20) 
“That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains I will trample him down: and his yoke shall be taken away from them, and his burden shall be removed from their shoulder.”

(Isaiah 14:21) 
This is the plan that I have planned over the whole earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

(Isaiah 14:22) 
For the Lord of hosts has decreed, and who can make it void? And his hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?

(Isaiah 14:23) 
In the year that Ahaz died, this prophecy was made:

(Isaiah 14:24) 
Do not rejoice, O Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken: for from the root of the serpent will come forth a basilisk, and his seed will devour the bird.

(Isaiah 14:25) 
And the firstborn of the poor shall be fed, and the poor will rest in confidence: and I will destroy your root with famine, and I will kill your remnants.

(Isaiah 14:26) 
Howl, gate; cry out, city; tremble, Philistia, all of you, for smoke will come from the north, and there is no one to retreat from his throng.

(Isaiah 14:27) 
What will be answered to the messengers of the nation? That the Lord has founded Zion, and in it the poor of his people will hope.

(Isaiah 15:1) 
The burden concerning Moab. In one night, Ar of Moab was destroyed, and it became silent.

(Isaiah 15:2) 
In one night, Moab was destroyed and became silent. In one night, Chîr of Moab was destroyed and became silent.

(Isaiah 15:3) 
The house of Moab goes up to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medaba. They have shaved off their beards and cut off every hand.

(Isaiah 15:4) 
In its streets, they wear sackcloth. On its rooftops and in its squares, there is wailing, weeping.

(Isaiah 15:5) 
My heart will wail for Moab. Its refugees flee to Zoar, and they weep as they go up the ascent of Luhith. On the road to Horonaim, they cry out a cry of destruction.

(Isaiah 15:6) 
The waters of Nimrim will be desolate, because the grass is dried up and the green things have withered, and there is nothing.

(Isaiah 15:7) 
Therefore, the remnant of their possessions and everything they saved will be carried across the stream to the weeping willows.

(Isaiah 15:8) 
For a cry has gone around the borders of Moab. Its wailing reached as far as Gallim and its cries as far as the well of Elim.

(Isaiah 15:9) 
For the waters of Dibon are full of blood. I will put more troubles on Dibon, and upon the lion of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.

(Isaiah 16:1) 
Send tribute to the ruler of the land, from the desert fortress, to the mountain of Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 16:2) 
And the people of Moab will be like frightened birds, or like fledglings driven from their nests.

(Isaiah 16:3) 
Give advice and make decisions. Provide shade in the heat of the day, as if it were night. Protect the fugitives, and do not betray the wanderers.

(Isaiah 16:4) 
Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you; be a refuge from the destroyer. For the oppressor is finished, the devastation is complete, the plunder is ended, and the oppression has ceased.

(Isaiah 16:5) 
A throne will be established in mercy, and on it will sit, in truth, a judge of the house of David. He will be a just judge, seeking justice, and quick to do righteousness.

(Isaiah 16:6) 
We have heard of Moab's pride—exceedingly proud—and its arrogance and boastfulness. But his boasting is empty.

(Isaiah 16:7) 
Therefore Moab will wail for Moab, and everyone will lament. You will all mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.

(Isaiah 16:8) 
The terraces of Heshbon are destroyed. The lords of the nations have trampled the choice vines of Sibmah, whose branches extended across the sea, even to Jazer. They reached into the desert.

(Isaiah 16:9) 
So I weep with the weeping of Jazer over the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you, Heshbon and Elealeh, with my tears, because the shouts of those who trample the grapes have fallen on your summer fruits and your harvest.

(Isaiah 16:10) 
Gladness and joy are gone from the orchards; in the vineyards there will be no singing or shouting; those who tread the winepress will not tread out wine.

(Isaiah 16:11) 
Therefore, my heart mourns for Moab like a harp, and my inmost being for Kir-hareseth.

(Isaiah 16:12) 
When Moab appears, weary on the high places, and goes to its sanctuary to pray, it will not prevail.

(Isaiah 16:13) 
This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning Moab in the past.

(Isaiah 16:14) 
But now the Lord says: 'Within three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab's glory will be despised, with all its great multitude, and those who remain will be few and feeble.'

(Isaiah 17:1) 
The prophecy concerning Damascus. Pay attention! Damascus will fall, and it will be like a pile of rubble.

(Isaiah 17:2) 
The cities of Aroer are abandoned and left for flocks to roam, with no one to scare them away.

(Isaiah 17:3) 
Ephraim will be stripped of its fortifications, and Damascus of its kingdom, and the remnant of Syria will be like the glory of the sons of Israel, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 17:4) 
In that day, the glory of Jacob will be diminished, and his flesh will become lean.

(Isaiah 17:5) 
It will be like gathering the grain, and his arm will cut down the harvest. It will be like gathering the remaining grain in the valley of Rephaim.

(Isaiah 17:6) 
Only a few survivors will remain, like the grapes that are left after the harvest, or a few olives left on the branch, or a few olives on the top, or in the corners of the branches, says the Lord God of Israel.

(Isaiah 17:7) 
In that day, mankind will look to the One who made him, and his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 17:8) 
He will not look to the altars, the work of his own hands, nor will he look to what his fingers have made. He will not regard the groves or temples of idols.

(Isaiah 17:9) 
In that day, his fortified cities will be abandoned, like the abandoned forests and fields which the sons of Israel left. Everything will become desolation.

(Isaiah 17:10) 
Because you have forgotten God, your salvation, and have not remembered your strength, you will plant the planting of faithlessness and sow the seed of the foreigner.

(Isaiah 17:11) 
On the day you plant, you will make a barrier. And in the morning your seed will blossom, but the harvest will be taken away on the day of your death.

(Isaiah 17:12) 
Woe to the multitude of peoples who roar like the roaring of the sea, and to the tumult of the nations who rage like the raging of mighty waters.

(Isaiah 17:13) 
The nations rage like the raging of many waters, but God will rebuke them, and they will flee far away, like the dust of the mountains before the wind, and like a whirlwind before the storm.

(Isaiah 17:14) 
At evening, there is chaos. Before dawn, there is nothing. And then, pay attention, there is the despoiling of many.

(Isaiah 17:15) 
The peoples, like ash, are consumed. Fire has consumed them, and there is no one to extinguish it.

(Isaiah 17:16) 
There will be no one to have mercy on them. Therefore, they will bear their iniquities.

(Isaiah 17:17) 
The sword is prepared against them, and against the people who feared Me, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 18:1) 
Alas, O land where the drums sound, that is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,

(Isaiah 18:2) 
who send emissaries across the sea, in papyrus boats upon the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation that has been torn and worn down: to a fearsome people from then and after: a nation expecting and trampled down, whose land the rivers divide.

(Isaiah 18:3) 
All who live on earth, when the banner is raised on the mountains, you will hear: and when the trumpet sounds, you will hear.

(Isaiah 18:4) 
For thus the Lord says to me: I will remain still, and I will consider in My place, like the summer in its heat, like clouds on the day of harvest.

(Isaiah 18:5) 
For before the harvest, when the grain is perfected, and the flower ripens, and turns into sour grapes, it will be cut with sickles, and the branches will be taken, and the vines will be cut down.

(Isaiah 18:6) 
And they will be left together for the birds of the mountains, and the beasts of the earth: and you will abandon them to the birds of summer, and all the beasts.

(Isaiah 18:7) 
At that time a gift will be brought to the Lord of hosts by a people torn and worn down, and by a fearsome people from then and beyond: from a nation expecting, and trampled down: whose land the rivers divide; to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, Mount Zion.

(Isaiah 19:1) 
The burden of Egypt: Behold, the Lord will come swiftly in a cloud, and He will enter Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof.

(Isaiah 19:2) 
And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

(Isaiah 19:3) 
And the spirit of Egypt shall be broken in the midst thereof, and I will cast down its counsel; and they shall consult idols and wizards, and those who have familiar spirits and diviners.

(Isaiah 19:4) 
And I will deliver Egypt into the hand of cruel lords, and a hard king shall rule over them, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 19:5) 
And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dry.

(Isaiah 19:6) 
And the rivers shall fail, and the flowing streams shall be diminished and dried up: the reed and the bulrush shall wither.

(Isaiah 19:7) 
The meadows by the river, in the mouth of the river, and every thing that is sown by the river, shall be dried up, and shall be no more.

(Isaiah 19:8) 
And the fishermen shall mourn, and all that cast a hook into the river shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.

(Isaiah 19:9) 
The workers in fine flax shall be confounded, and the weavers of fine linen, and they that make the webs.

(Isaiah 19:10) 
And there shall be in that day five cities in the land of Egypt, speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts: one shall be called the city of the sun.

(Isaiah 19:11) 
In that day there shall be an altar of the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a title of the Lord near its borders.

(Isaiah 19:12) 
And it shall be for a sign and for a testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the Lord because of the oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a defender, and He will deliver them.

(Isaiah 19:13) 
And the Lord shall be known by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and they shall worship with sacrifices and oblations: and they shall vow vows to the Lord, and perform them.

(Isaiah 19:14) 
And the Lord will strike Egypt with a plague, and will heal it: and they shall turn to the Lord, and He will hear them, and will heal them.

(Isaiah 19:15) 
In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians: and the Assyrian shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

(Isaiah 19:16) 
In that day shall Egypt be the third to Israel, with the blessing of the Lord of hosts, saying: Blessed be my people of Egypt, and the work of my hands of the Assyrians, and my inheritance of Israel.

(Isaiah 20:1) 
In the year the general Tharthan was sent to Ashdod by Sargon, the king of Assyria. The general then fought against Ashdod, and captured it,

(Isaiah 20:2) 
At that time, the Lord gave a message through Isaiah, the son of Amoz. He said: “Go, take off the sackcloth from your waist, and take off your sandals.” Isaiah did as he was told, going about naked and barefoot.

(Isaiah 20:3) 
Then the Lord said: “As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years, as a sign and a wonder regarding Egypt and Ethiopia,

(Isaiah 20:4) 
So will the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, both young and old. They will be naked and barefoot, and their backsides will be exposed—the humiliation of Egypt.

(Isaiah 20:5) 
They will be terrified and ashamed of Ethiopia and Egypt, their hope and glory. On that day, they will say, “That is what happened to our hope. We fled to Egypt for help, but the king of Assyria will come and destroy us.”

(Isaiah 21:1) 
This is a prophecy about the desert by the sea. As a sudden storm from the south, sweeping in from the desert, from a terrifying land,

(Isaiah 21:2) 
a difficult vision was announced to me. Who will tell it to everyone?

(Isaiah 21:3) 
The one who sees it is troubled. The one who hears it is stunned.

(Isaiah 21:4) 
My pain is turned into something terrifying: as if I am in labor and writhing. I am so worried that I can't hear clearly; I am so upset that I can't see clearly.

(Isaiah 21:5) 
My heart is troubled. Fear and trembling have come over me. The night that I longed for is now a nightmare.

(Isaiah 21:6) 
Set the table. Station the guards. Eat and drink! Prepare to stand up, and polish your shields.

(Isaiah 21:7) 
The Lord said to me, “Go, appoint a watchman. Let him announce whatever he sees.

(Isaiah 21:8) 
The watchman saw a chariot with two horses, and a rider on a donkey and a camel. He paid careful attention to what he saw, with a great deal of fear.

(Isaiah 21:9) 
Then the watchman, sounding the alarm, cried out: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower during the day, and I am standing on my guard all night.

(Isaiah 21:10) 
Behold, here comes a chariot with two horses! He gave the answer and said, “Babylon has fallen, and all of its carved idols are shattered on the ground.”

(Isaiah 21:11) 
This is a prophecy about the land of Edom. The people of Seir are calling to me: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”

(Isaiah 21:12) 
The watchman said: “Morning is coming, and also night. If you wish to know more, then come back again.”

(Isaiah 21:13) 
This is a prophecy about Arabia. Those who travel through the thickets of the forests in Arabia, you Dodanites, should prepare to rest.

(Isaiah 21:14) 
Bring water to the thirsty. You who live in the land of Tema, meet the fleeing people with food.

(Isaiah 21:15) 
For they have fled before the swords, before the drawn sword, before the stretched bow, and before the battle.

(Isaiah 21:16) 
For the Lord said to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count, all the glory of Kedar will be gone:

(Isaiah 21:17) 
and the remaining number of the strong archers of the sons of Kedar will be diminished.” This is the Lord God of Israel speaking.

(Isaiah 22:1) 
This prophecy concerns the valley of Jerusalem. Why have you gathered everyone and ascended to the roofs?

(Isaiah 22:2) 
Jerusalem is full of shouting. It is a city of exultation. Your slain are not slain by the sword, nor have they died in battle.

(Isaiah 22:3) 
Your leaders have all fled together. They were bound by archers, and all your captives were bound together.

(Isaiah 22:4) 
Therefore I said: “Turn away from me. Let me weep bitterly. Do not press me to console myself because of the desolation of the daughter of my people.”

(Isaiah 22:5) 
For the day of the Lord of hosts will be a day of tribulation, and of trampling, and of confusion in the valley of vision, to break down the wall, and to cry to the mountain.

(Isaiah 22:6) 
Elam took up the quiver with the chariot of the horseman; the shield uncovered its strength.

(Isaiah 22:7) 
Your choicest valleys will be full of chariots, and the horsemen will set themselves in array before the gate.

(Isaiah 22:8) 
Then the covering of Judah was revealed, and you looked to the armor of the house of the forest.

(Isaiah 22:9) 
You saw that the breaches in the city of David multiplied, and that you gathered the waters of the lower pool.

(Isaiah 22:10) 
You have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and have torn down houses to fortify the wall.

(Isaiah 22:11) 
You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water, but you did not look to him who made it, nor did you have any regard for him who formed it long ago.

(Isaiah 22:12) 
In that day, the Lord God of hosts summoned you to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.

(Isaiah 22:13) 
But instead, there is joy and gladness, slaughtering cattle and killing sheep, eating meat, and drinking wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.”

(Isaiah 22:14) 
Then the Lord of hosts revealed it in my ears: “Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord God of hosts.

(Isaiah 22:15) 
Thus says the Lord God of hosts: “Go, enter to this one who dwells in the temple, to Shebna, who is over the house.

(Isaiah 22:16) 
Say, “What do you have here? Or whom do you have here, that you have cut out a tomb for yourself here, cutting out a tomb on high, and carving a dwelling for yourself in the rock?”

(Isaiah 22:17) 
Behold, the Lord will hurl you away violently. He will toss you. He will wind you up.

(Isaiah 22:18) 
He will wrap you up and toss you like a ball, into a vast and spacious land. There you will die, and there will be the chariot of your glory, the shame of your master’s house.

(Isaiah 22:19) 
I will hurl you from your position, and I will cast you down from your office.

(Isaiah 22:20) 
And it shall be in that day: I will summon my servant Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah,

(Isaiah 22:21) 
And I will clothe him with your tunic, and I will strengthen him with your belt, and I will give your authority into his hand. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

(Isaiah 22:22) 
And I will place the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.

(Isaiah 22:23) 
And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house.

(Isaiah 22:24) 
And they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the small vessels, from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of musical instruments.

(Isaiah 22:25) 
In that day, says the Lord of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will be removed, and it will break and fall, and the burden that was upon it will perish, for the Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 23:1) 
A prophecy about Tyre: Wail, all the ships on the sea, for the city of Tyre has been utterly destroyed. All the sailors will cry out once they come ashore.

(Isaiah 23:2) 
The sailors of Sidon, who come and go, will realize what happened to Tyre, and will cry out over what Tyre has lost.

(Isaiah 23:3) 
Tyre was a great merchant city, and the people of many nations relied on her for their food and goods, especially as she controlled the seas.

(Isaiah 23:4) 
The sea will be ashamed, saying, "I have not given birth, nor have I given any life to those who live in Tyre."

(Isaiah 23:5) 
When the news reaches Egypt, all the people will cry out with anguish over what has befallen Tyre.

(Isaiah 23:6) 
Go to Tarshish, and lament, you who live on the island of Tyre.

(Isaiah 23:7) 
Is this the city of joy, which has always been a place of traders and the hub of sea commerce?

(Isaiah 23:8) 
Who is responsible for the downfall of Tyre? Tyre, the city of merchants, whose merchants are princes, and whose traders are the most honored people in the world?

(Isaiah 23:9) 
The Lord of Hosts has decided to do this, to humble all the glory of Tyre, and bring shame to all the nobles on the earth.

(Isaiah 23:10) 
Go through your land like a river, daughter of Tarshish, and see what has happened to your wealth.

(Isaiah 23:11) 
The Lord has reached out His hand over the sea and shaken the kingdoms. He has given a command against the land of Canaan, that Tyre be utterly destroyed.

(Isaiah 23:12) 
And He said, "You will never again be joyful, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, go over to Cyprus. There you will find no rest." You will find no peace there.

(Isaiah 23:13) 
Look at the land of the Chaldeans, a nation that did not exist before the Assyrians founded it. They have captured the strongest soldiers of Tyre and destroyed its palaces. They have laid it waste.

(Isaiah 23:14) 
Wail, you ships of Tarshish, for your strength has been destroyed.

(Isaiah 23:15) 
In that day, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the length of a king's reign. After seventy years, Tyre will be like a prostitute who sings and plays the harp to attract customers.

(Isaiah 23:16) 
After seventy years, the Lord will visit Tyre and restore its prosperity. Tyre will return to her trade and will be in demand with all the kingdoms of the world.

(Isaiah 23:17) 
Her profits and her wages will be dedicated to the Lord. They will not be stored up or hoarded, but will be used for the benefit of those who live before the Lord, so that they may have plenty to eat and good clothing.

(Isaiah 24:1) 
Behold, the Lord will make the earth a desolation, and will lay it waste; and will turn it upside down, and will scatter its inhabitants.

(Isaiah 24:2) 
And as with the people, so with the priest; and as with the servant, so with his master; as with the handmaid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.

(Isaiah 24:3) 
The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.

(Isaiah 24:4) 
The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the lofty people of the earth languish.

(Isaiah 24:5) 
The earth is defiled under its inhabitants: because they have transgressed the laws, they have changed the ordinance, they have broken the everlasting covenant.

(Isaiah 24:6) 
Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein shall be desolate: therefore the inhabitants thereof shall be mad, and few men shall be left.

(Isaiah 24:7) 
The wine mourns, the vine languisheth, all the merry of heart sigh.

(Isaiah 24:8) 
The mirth of tabrets hath ceased, the noise of them that rejoice is ended, the joy of the harp is silent.

(Isaiah 24:9) 
They shall not drink wine with a song; the drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

(Isaiah 24:10) 
The city of vanity is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

(Isaiah 24:11) 
There shall be a cry in the streets because of wine; all joy is forsaken; the mirth of the land is gone away.

(Isaiah 24:12) 
In the city there is desolation, and the gate is broken with pieces.

(Isaiah 24:13) 
For it shall be thus in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the people: as if a few olives should remain, that have been shaken out of the olive tree: or grapes when the vintage is done.

(Isaiah 24:14) 
These shall lift up their voice, and give praise; in the islands of the sea they shall glorify the name of the Lord.

(Isaiah 24:15) 
Therefore glorify ye the Lord in the doctrine of fire, in the islands of the sea the name of the Lord God of Israel.

(Isaiah 24:16) 
From the ends of the earth we have heard praises, the glory of the just one. And I said: My secret to me, my secret to me. Woe is me! the prevaricators have prevaricated: and with the prevarication of transgressors they have prevaricated.

(Isaiah 24:17) 
Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O thou inhabitant of the earth.

(Isaiah 24:18) 
And it shall come to pass, that he that shall flee from the noise of the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.

(Isaiah 24:19) 
The earth shall be shaken, it shall be greatly moved, it shall be broken asunder as a cup, and shall be moved to and fro like a tent: and the iniquity thereof shall be heavy upon it.

(Isaiah 24:20) 
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall visit upon the sword his hard, and great, and strong one, upon Leviathan the piercing serpent, and upon Leviathan the winding serpent: and shall slay the whale that is in the sea.

(Isaiah 24:21) 
In that day there shall be a vineyard of red wine: sing ye to it.

(Isaiah 24:22) 
I am the Lord that keep it; I will suddenly give it drink: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

(Isaiah 24:23) 
In that day there shall be a vineyard of wine: sing ye to it.

(Isaiah 25:1) 
Lord, You are my God; I will praise You, and I will give thanks to Your name because You do wonders, fulfilling ancient plans with faithfulness. Amen.

(Isaiah 25:2) 
For You have made the city into a heap of rubble, the fortified city.

(Isaiah 25:3) 
You have turned the city into ruins, and cast down its buildings never to be rebuilt.

(Isaiah 25:4) 
Therefore, a strong people will praise You; the city of the powerful nations will fear You.

(Isaiah 25:5) 
For You have become the refuge of the poor, the refuge of the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm, and a shade from the heat. The shadow of the powerful is like an impetuous storm.

(Isaiah 25:6) 
Like heat in a dry land, You will calm the tumult of the foreigners. Like heat in a dry land, You will humble the pride of the arrogant.

(Isaiah 25:7) 
And the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples on this mountain a feast of rich foods, a feast of purified wine, of rich marrow, of purified wine, well-strained.

(Isaiah 25:8) 
And He will destroy on this mountain the veil that covers all peoples, the woven garment that covers all nations.

(Isaiah 25:9) 
He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and He will take away the reproach of His people from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.

(Isaiah 25:10) 
In that day it will be said, “Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him; we will exult and rejoice in His salvation.”

(Isaiah 25:11) 
For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain; and Moab will be trampled under Him, as straw is trampled in a cart.

(Isaiah 25:12) 
And He will stretch out His hands over them, as the swimmer stretches out to swim; and He will bring low their pride with the trampling of their hands.

(Isaiah 25:13) 
He will bring down the high fortifications of your walls, humble them, and cast them down to the ground.

(Isaiah 26:1) 
In the land of Judah, our strong city is located. The Savior will be placed there. The Savior will be present within her.

(Isaiah 26:2) 
Open the gates! Let those enter who do what is right, who uphold the truth.

(Isaiah 26:3) 
The old error has passed away. You will preserve peace, because we put our hope in You.

(Isaiah 26:4) 
Lord, we put our hope in You along the path of Your judgment. The memory of Your name is our longing and desire.

(Isaiah 26:5) 
I desired You in my soul at night, and with my spirit within me, I will rise early in the morning to meet You.

(Isaiah 26:6) 
For when Your judgments come to the earth, those who live on Earth will learn justice.

(Isaiah 26:7) 
If the wicked are removed, they will not see the glory of the Lord. Shame will befall them, and the zeal of the people will consume them. Now, fire will consume the adversaries.

(Isaiah 26:8) 
Lord, You will grant us peace, for You have performed all our works for us.

(Isaiah 26:9) 
Lord our God, we have been dominated by lords other than You. But now we remember Your name only.

(Isaiah 26:10) 
They are dead, they shall not live: they shall fall, and shall not rise again. Therefore, You have visited and punished them, and have destroyed all memory of them from the earth.

(Isaiah 26:11) 
You have increased the nation, Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified. You have widened all the borders of the land.

(Isaiah 26:12) 
Lord, in tribulation they visited You. In times of distress, as in childbirth, I whispered a prayer.

(Isaiah 26:13) 
As a woman with child cries out in her labor pains, so we have become before You, Lord.

(Isaiah 26:14) 
We conceived, and it seemed we gave birth to wickedness, but we have produced a spirit of salvation.

(Isaiah 26:15) 
The dead will not live, nor will those who have fallen rise again. Therefore, You have visited and punished them, and have destroyed all memory of them.

(Isaiah 26:16) 
You have increased the nation, Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified. You have moved the borders of the earth.

(Isaiah 26:17) 
Lord, in tribulation they visited You, in times of distress they cried out as if in childbirth.

(Isaiah 26:18) 
As a woman in her pregnancy approaches childbirth and suffers, and cries out in her pain, so we are before You, Lord.

(Isaiah 26:19) 
Your dead will live, their bodies will rise. Awake, and sing, you who dwell in the dust, for Your dew is the dew of light, and You will crush the land of giants.

(Isaiah 26:20) 
Go, my people, enter your chambers, close your door behind you. Hide yourself a little while, until the wrath passes.

(Isaiah 26:21) 
For the Lord will come out of His place to punish the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth. The earth will reveal its blood, and it will no longer hide its dead.

(Isaiah 27:1) 
In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:

(Isaiah 27:2) 
Our strong city is Zion: God will place salvation in it like a wall and a rampart.

(Isaiah 27:3) 
Open the gates, that the just nation may enter, the one that keeps the truth.

(Isaiah 27:4) 
The old error has passed away: keep peace, peace: because we have hoped in You.

(Isaiah 27:5) 
You have hoped in the Lord throughout the ages, in the Lord, the strongest; therefore, He has destroyed the inhabitants of the high places, a lofty city.

(Isaiah 27:6) 
He will humble the high city, He will humble it to the ground, He will bring it down to the dust.

(Isaiah 27:7) 
The foot will tread it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.

(Isaiah 27:8) 
For Zion is eternal, and the poor will dwell in it.

(Isaiah 27:9) 
And there will be a direct path, and it will be called the holy way: the polluted will not pass through it, and this is the right way for you, so that you do not go astray.

(Isaiah 27:10) 
There will not be a lion there, and the harmful beast will not ascend it, nor will it be found there: but those who have been freed will walk.

(Isaiah 27:11) 
And those redeemed by the Lord will return, and will come to Zion with praise, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they will obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow will flee away.

(Isaiah 27:12) 
I, I am your comforter. Who are you, that you should be afraid of the face of mortal man, and of the son of man, who is like grass that is dried up?

(Isaiah 27:13) 
And have you forgotten the Lord your Maker, who stretched out the heavens, and founded the earth? And you have been in constant fear all day long because of the face of the fury of the oppressor: where is the fury of the oppressor?

(Isaiah 27:14) 
Quickly he will come, who cries out, and he will not die in the pit, nor will his bread fail.

(Isaiah 27:15) 
But I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea, and moves its waves: the Lord of hosts is My name.

(Isaiah 27:16) 
And I have put My words in your mouth, and I have protected you in the shadow of My hand: that I may plant the heavens, and found the earth, and say to Zion: You are My people.

(Isaiah 27:17) 
Arise, arise, stand up, Jerusalem, who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of wrath: you have drunk to the bottom of the cup of drunkenness, and you have drained it.

(Isaiah 27:18) 
There is none to guide her from all the sons she has brought forth: and there is none who will hold her hand from all the sons she has nourished.

(Isaiah 27:19) 
Two things have happened to you: who will grieve over you? Desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword; who will comfort you?

(Isaiah 27:20) 
Your sons have fainted, they have lain down at the head of all the ways like a buffalo in a snare, full of the indignation of the Lord, the wrath of your God.

(Isaiah 27:21) 
Therefore, hear these things, you poor thing, and you who are drunk, but not with wine.

(Isaiah 27:22) 
Thus says the Lord your Lord, and your God, who will fight for His people: Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of drunkenness, the cup of indignation: you will drink it no more.

(Isaiah 27:23) 
And I will put it in the hand of those who have humbled you, who have said to your soul: Bow down, that we may pass: and you have made your back as the ground, and as a way for those who pass by.

(Isaiah 28:1) 
Woe to the proud wreath of the drunkards of Ephraim, to the fading flower that is their glorious beauty, those who are on the top of the fertile valley, overcome by wine.

(Isaiah 28:2) 
Behold, the Lord is strong and mighty; he shall come as a storm of hail, a devastating whirlwind, like a torrent of many waters overflowing. He will cast them down to earth with a strong hand.

(Isaiah 28:3) 
The proud wreath of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trampled underfoot.

(Isaiah 28:4) 
And the fading flower of their glory, which is on the top of the fertile valley, will be like the first fruit before summer. Whoever sees it, immediately devours it while it is still in their hand.

(Isaiah 28:5) 
In that day, the Lord of Hosts will be a crown of glory and a crown of joy to the remnant of His people:

(Isaiah 28:6) 
And a spirit of judgment to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who return to battle.

(Isaiah 28:7) 
But even these err because of wine and stagger in drunkenness. The priest and the prophet have erred through wine, they are swallowed up by wine, they wander in drunkenness, they do not know the one who sees, they do not understand judgment.

(Isaiah 28:8) 
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no clean place.

(Isaiah 28:9) 
Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? To those just weaned, those removed from the breast?

(Isaiah 28:10) 
For it is: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, a little here, a little there.

(Isaiah 28:11) 
For with stammering lips and a foreign tongue, he will speak to this people.

(Isaiah 28:12) 
To whom he said: "This is my rest, take your rest." But they would not listen.

(Isaiah 28:13) 
So the word of the Lord will be to them: precept upon precept, precept upon precept, a little here, a little there; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

(Isaiah 28:14) 
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers, who are among this people in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 28:15) 
Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, and with hell we have made a pact: when the overflowing scourge passes through, it will not come upon us, because we have made lies our refuge, and we are protected by deceit."

(Isaiah 28:16) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will lay in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a cornerstone, precious, founded on the foundation: he who believes will not be in haste.

(Isaiah 28:17) 
And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line; and the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hidden place.

(Isaiah 28:18) 
And your covenant with death will be annulled, and your pact with hell will not stand; when the overflowing scourge comes, you will be crushed by it.

(Isaiah 28:19) 
As often as it passes, it will take you away; for it will pass through every morning and through the day and through the night, and it will be terror, the mere hearing of the message.

(Isaiah 28:20) 
For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the covering is too narrow to wrap oneself in.

(Isaiah 28:21) 
For as the Lord will be enraged on Mount Perazim, so will he be moved in the valley of Gabaon, to do his work, his strange work, and to accomplish his task, his alien task.

(Isaiah 28:22) 
So now do not be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong, for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord God of Hosts, determined against the whole earth.

(Isaiah 28:23) 
Give ear and hear my voice; listen and hear my speech.

(Isaiah 28:24) 
Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he open and harrow his land all day?

(Isaiah 28:25) 
Does he not level its surface and then scatter the dill, the cumin, and then sow the wheat, barley, and spelt in its proper place?

(Isaiah 28:26) 
And God teaches him how to work, He instructs him.

(Isaiah 28:27) 
For the dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a flail, and the cumin with a rod.

(Isaiah 28:28) 
Bread is prepared by crushing it, but he will not always be threshing it; nor will he crush it with the wheel of a cart, nor break it with the hooves of his animals.

(Isaiah 28:29) 
This also comes from the Lord of Hosts: his wondrous counsel, and his great work.

(Isaiah 29:1) 
Woe to Jerusalem, Jerusalem, city where David dwelled! Let the years pass: turn your cycles, and I will gather Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 29:2) 
Jerusalem shall be in distress and I will bring sorrow to the city. Jerusalem will become a city of pain for me.

(Isaiah 29:3) 
I will besiege Jerusalem and surround it like a ball or a wheel.

(Isaiah 29:4) 
Jerusalem will be humbled and speak from the earth. Your voice will be heard as if it came from the dust. You will be like a python, and your whispers will be heard from the ground.

(Isaiah 29:5) 
Your many enemies will be like dust. Their great power will be quickly destroyed.

(Isaiah 29:6) 
The Lord of hosts will come and punish you with thunder, with earthquake, with loud noise, with storm, with tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

(Isaiah 29:7) 
And the multitude of all the nations that fought against Jerusalem will be like a dream. All those who battled against and besieged Jerusalem will be like a dream.

(Isaiah 29:8) 
As a hungry man dreams he is eating, but when he wakes, his stomach is empty, or as a thirsty man dreams he is drinking, but when he wakes, he is exhausted and his soul is still thirsty, so it will be with the multitude of all the nations that warred against Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 29:9) 
Be astonished, and wonder, and be delighted, and cry out. Be drunk, but not with wine, and stagger, but not with strong drink.

(Isaiah 29:10) 
God has poured out a spirit of deep sleep on you, and closed your eyes. He has covered the eyes of your prophets and seers.

(Isaiah 29:11) 
Every vision will be like the words of a sealed book. If you give the book to someone who can read, and you say, "Read this", he will reply, "I cannot; it is sealed."

(Isaiah 29:12) 
If the book is given to someone who cannot read and you say, "Read this," he will reply, "I do not know how to read."

(Isaiah 29:13) 
The Lord has said, "Because this people approaches me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

(Isaiah 29:14) 
Therefore, I will confound this people with new and wondrous actions, and I will take away the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent.

(Isaiah 29:15) 
Woe to those who are deep in heart, and hide their counsel from the Lord, and whose works are in the dark, who say: "Who sees us? And who knows us?"

(Isaiah 29:16) 
Your thinking is perverse, like the clay of the potter. Will the thing made say to the maker, "He did not make me?" Or will a work say to the craftsman, "He does not understand?"

(Isaiah 29:17) 
In a little while, will Lebanon not be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted as a forest?

(Isaiah 29:18) 
In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see after darkness and obscurity.

(Isaiah 29:19) 
The meek will increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 29:20) 
For the mighty will be brought to nothing, the oppressor will be finished, and all those who watched for iniquity will be cut off.

(Isaiah 29:21) 
They cause men to sin in the word, and supplant those who rebuke in the gate, and they turn aside from the just.

(Isaiah 29:22) 
Therefore, thus says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham, "Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will his face now be sad.

(Isaiah 29:23) 
But when he sees his children, the works of my hands in their midst, sanctifying my name, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will fear the God of Israel.

(Isaiah 29:24) 
And those who err in spirit will know understanding, and the murmurers will learn the law.

(Isaiah 30:1) 
Woe to the sons of the desert, says the Lord, who begin plans that are not from Me, and weave a fabric of deception, not by My Spirit, so that they pile sin upon sin.

(Isaiah 30:2) 
They travel to go down to Egypt, and have not asked My counsel, trusting in the shadow of Pharaoh, seeking protection in the shelter of Egypt.

(Isaiah 30:3) 
The strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the confidence you have in the shadow of Egypt will be to your disgrace.

(Isaiah 30:4) 
For the leaders of Egypt were at Tanis, and its envoys came to Hanes.

(Isaiah 30:5) 
All will be ashamed because of the people, who will not profit them: they will be of no help, nor of any use, but will bring shame and disgrace.

(Isaiah 30:6) 
The burden of the beasts of the south: in the land of tribulation and anguish, the lion, the lioness, the viper, and the flying serpent: they carry on the shoulders of asses their riches, and on the humps of camels their treasures, to a people who will not profit them.

(Isaiah 30:7) 
Egypt will vainly help and give nothing: therefore I have cried out to Egypt, "Be still."

(Isaiah 30:8) 
Now go, write this in a book, and record it on a tablet, so that it may be for the last day, as a testimony forever.

(Isaiah 30:9) 
For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children unwilling to hear the law of God.

(Isaiah 30:10) 
They say to the seers: “Do not see visions,” and to those who have visions, “Do not look at things that are right; speak to us smooth things, see for us delusions.”

(Isaiah 30:11) 
Turn aside from the way, turn aside from the path, remove the Holy One of Israel from our sight.

(Isaiah 30:12) 
Therefore, the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you despise this word, and trust in deceit and rebellion, and rely on it:

(Isaiah 30:13) 
This iniquity will be for you like a breach, falling and bulging in a wall, which will suddenly come at an unexpected time.

(Isaiah 30:14) 
It will break like a potter's vessel, and be shattered, so that there will not be found among its fragments a piece with which to carry fire from the hearth, or to draw water from the cisterns.

(Isaiah 30:15) 
For the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, says this: “In repentance and silence is your strength, and in hope and in justice will be your power.” But you would not.

(Isaiah 30:16) 
And you said, “No, we will flee on horses.” Therefore you shall flee. “We will ride on swift horses.” Therefore those who pursue you will be swift.

(Isaiah 30:17) 
A thousand men will flee at the sight of one, and at the sight of five you will flee, until you are left like a pole on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.

(Isaiah 30:18) 
And therefore the Lord waits to have mercy on you: and therefore He will be exalted, sparing you: for the Lord is a God of judgment, and blessed are all who wait for Him.

(Isaiah 30:19) 
For a people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: You will weep, and at the sound of your cry, as soon as He hears you, He will answer you.

(Isaiah 30:20) 
And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction: your teacher will not be removed from you, and your eyes will see your teacher.

(Isaiah 30:21) 
And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” neither turning to the right nor the left.

(Isaiah 30:22) 
And you will defile the plates of your carved silver, and the garment of your molten gold, and you will scatter them as an unclean thing: “Get out,” you will say to it.

(Isaiah 30:23) 
And rain will be given to your seed, wherever you sow it in the land: and the bread from the produce of the earth will be most abundant and rich: in that day your livestock will graze in wide pastures.

(Isaiah 30:24) 
And the bulls and the asses that plow the land will eat fodder seasoned with flavor, which has been winnowed in the threshing floor.

(Isaiah 30:25) 
And on every high mountain, and on every elevated hill, there will be streams of flowing water, on the day when many are slain, when the towers fall.

(Isaiah 30:26) 
And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when the Lord binds up the wound of His people and heals the pain of their wound.

(Isaiah 30:27) 
Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar, His burning anger, and heavy to bear: His lips are filled with indignation, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.

(Isaiah 30:28) 
His Spirit is like an overflowing torrent up to the neck: to destroy the nations in vanity, and with the bridle of error that is in the jaws of the peoples.

(Isaiah 30:29) 
Your song will be like the night of a consecrated festival, and the joy of the heart, like one who goes to hear, on the mountain of the Lord, to the strong one of Israel.

(Isaiah 30:30) 
And the Lord will make His glorious voice heard, and will make them hear the strength of His arm, with the indignation of His fury, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a tempestuous attack.

(Isaiah 30:31) 
For at the voice of the Lord, Assyria will be troubled, and it will be struck with the rod.

(Isaiah 30:32) 
And there will be a firm foundation for the rod that the Lord will make to rest upon him, with timbrels and harps, and He will fight against them in battles.

(Isaiah 30:33) 
For Tophet is prepared of old, and it also is prepared for the king: deep and wide: with fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord will burn it like a torrent of sulfur.

(Isaiah 31:1) 
Woe to those who turn to Egypt for help, trusting in horses and chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are strong; but they have not put their trust in the Holy One of Israel, nor sought the Lord.

(Isaiah 31:2) 
But He Who is wise brought evil, and did not withdraw His word; He will arise against the house of the wicked, and against those who help do evil.

(Isaiah 31:3) 
Egypt is a man, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When He stretches out His hand, the helper will fall, and he whom he helps will fall, and they will all perish together.

(Isaiah 31:4) 
For thus says the Lord to me: "As the lion roars and the young lion over his prey, when a multitude of shepherds are called against him, he is not afraid at their voice or disturbed at their clamor, so the Lord of hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill."

(Isaiah 31:5) 
Like birds hovering, so the Lord of hosts will protect Jerusalem; protecting and delivering, passing over and saving.

(Isaiah 31:6) 
Return to Him from whom the children of Israel have deeply departed.

(Isaiah 31:7) 
For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you.

(Isaiah 31:8) 
Then the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the face of the sword, and his chosen men shall pay tribute.

(Isaiah 31:9) 
And his strength shall pass away with fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the standard, says the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.

(Isaiah 32:1) 
Look! A king will rule with perfect justice, and his leaders will govern with righteous judgment.

(Isaiah 32:2) 
And this man, the king, will be like a refuge from the wind, a cover from the scorching heat. He will be like rushing streams of water in a parched land, and the shade of a massive rock in a desolate desert.

(Isaiah 32:3) 
The eyes of those who truly see will no longer be dim, and the ears of those who truly hear will listen with greater attention.

(Isaiah 32:4) 
The minds of the foolish will then understand knowledge, and the tongues of those who stammer will speak quickly and clearly.

(Isaiah 32:5) 
The foolish person will no longer be called a leader, nor will the deceitful be called a great man.

(Isaiah 32:6) 
For the foolish person speaks foolish things, and his heart plots evil. He practices hypocrisy and speaks lies against the Lord. He leaves the hungry soul empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.

(Isaiah 32:7) 
The deceitful also use wicked schemes. He devises evil plans to destroy the humble with lying words, even when the poor man speaks what is right.

(Isaiah 32:8) 
But the noble man plans noble things, and he will stand firm in noble leadership.

(Isaiah 32:9) 
Rise up, you complacent women, and listen to my voice! You overconfident daughters, pay close attention to my words!

(Isaiah 32:10) 
In just a little more than a year, you confident women will be troubled, for the grape harvest will fail completely; no produce will be gathered.

(Isaiah 32:11) 
Tremble, you confident women! Be troubled, you carefree ones! Strip off your fine clothing and expose your bare skin. Gird sackcloth around your waists in mourning.

(Isaiah 32:12) 
Beat your breasts in lamentation for the lovely fields, for the fruitful vine, and for all that was desirable.

(Isaiah 32:13) 
For upon the land of my people, thorns and thistles will grow, covering all the houses of joy in the once jubilant city.

(Isaiah 32:14) 
Indeed, the palace is abandoned, the bustling city is deserted. Gloom and darkness have settled in the desolate caves and ruins for a long time. It will become a place of delight for wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks.

(Isaiah 32:15) 
This will continue until the Spirit from on high is poured out upon us. Then the wilderness will become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be considered a forest.

(Isaiah 32:16) 
And justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will reside in the fruitful field.

(Isaiah 32:17) 
And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quiet confidence and lasting security forever.

(Isaiah 32:18) 
Then my people will dwell in peaceful dwellings, in secure habitations, and in tranquil places of abundant rest.

(Isaiah 32:19) 
But hail will bring down the forest, and the city that caused humiliation will be utterly brought low.

(Isaiah 32:20) 
Blessed are you who sow seeds by all waters, letting the ox and the donkey freely tread the ground.

(Isaiah 33:1) 
Woe to you who plunders others, yet you yourself are not plundered by anyone in return. But when you finish your devastation, you yourself will be devastated in turn! Will you not, when you cease to despise others, then be despised yourself?

(Isaiah 33:2) 
O Lord, have mercy on us; for we have waited and hoped in You. Be our strength and the might of our arm every morning, and be our salvation in our time of tribulation and great distress.

(Isaiah 33:3) 
At the sound of God’s powerful messenger, the nations that oppress His people will flee in terror. From Your rising up in power, the Gentile nations will be scattered.

(Isaiah 33:4) 
And your plunder, O oppressor, will be gathered up by your victims just like a swarm of locusts gathers over a field. Just as locusts gather, so will your spoils be gathered from you.

(Isaiah 33:5) 
Great is the Lord, because He dwells on high, in the heavens above the universe. He has filled Sion (the City of God) with justice and righteousness.

(Isaiah 33:6) 
And there will be faithfulness and stability in your times. The riches of your salvation will be wisdom and true knowledge. The reverence and awe of the Lord Himself is the treasure that God gives to His people.

(Isaiah 33:7) 
Behold, the watchmen who look out from the public squares will weep in sorrow. The messengers of peace, who went to negotiate with the oppressors, will weep bitterly.

(Isaiah 33:8) 
The roads are desolate and deserted; the passage of travelers has ceased. The treaties and covenants made with the oppressor have been made void. He has rejected and destroyed cities, and he has shown no regard for human life.

(Isaiah 33:9) 
The land itself mourns and wastes away in sorrow. Lebanon is put to shame and its forests have withered. The fertile Plain of Sharon has become like a desert, and the rich regions of Bashan and Carmel are devastated.

(Isaiah 33:10) 
Now I will arise, says the Lord. Now I will be exalted in power. Now I will be lifted up and glorified.

(Isaiah 33:11) 
You, the oppressors, will conceive only trouble and bring forth only stubble and chaff. Your own spirit, your own rage and wickedness, will consume you like a devouring fire.

(Isaiah 33:12) 
And the peoples who oppose Me will be like burned lime, reduced to ashes. Like thorns that have been trampled, they will be completely burned up by fire.

(Isaiah 33:13) 
Hear, you who are near to Me, what I have done. And you who are far off, acknowledge My strength and My power.

(Isaiah 33:14) 
The sinners in Sion are terrified. Trembling has seized the hypocrites and the godless. Who among you, then, will be able to dwell with a devouring fire, which is the righteous judgment of God? Who among you will be able to dwell with everlasting burnings?

(Isaiah 33:15) 
It is he who walks in true righteousness and speaks the truth, rejecting dishonest gain from his hand and shaking his hand to refuse every bribe. He stops his ears from listening to talk of bloodshed and closes his eyes from looking upon evil.

(Isaiah 33:16) 
Such a person will dwell securely on high, in elevated places. The fortresses of rocks will be his refuge and his stronghold. He is given his daily bread, and his water supply is sure and constant.

(Isaiah 33:17) 
His eyes will see the King, God Himself, in His splendor and majesty. They will also see the promised land stretching out far away into the distance.

(Isaiah 33:18) 
Your heart will recall the terror and distress of the past. Then you will ask: 'Where is the scribe who recorded the tribute? Where is he who weighed the tax money? Where is the mighty oppressor who counted the towers for siege?'

(Isaiah 33:19) 
You will no longer see the insolent and arrogant people who invaded your land. You will not see the people whose language was so deep and foreign that you could not understand their speech; nor will you hear their arrogant tongue, which you could not comprehend.

(Isaiah 33:20) 
Look upon Sion, the city of our solemn feasts and holy gatherings! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful and prosperous dwelling place. It will be like a tent that will never be taken down; its tent pegs will never be removed for all time, and none of its ropes will ever break.

(Isaiah 33:21) 
For there, in Jerusalem, our Lord will be glorious and powerful. He will be to us like mighty rivers, broad and wide-flowing streams, providing impenetrable defense. No warship rowed by enemies will pass through it, nor will any great ship of war sail upon it.

(Isaiah 33:22) 
For the Lord is our Judge. The Lord is our Lawgiver. The Lord is our King. He Himself will save us.

(Isaiah 33:23) 
The ropes of your enemy's 'ship' (their military strength and siege equipment) are slackened and loose; they will not hold firm. Their mast is so weakened that it cannot stand upright, and their sails cannot hold any wind to move their ships (your captured cities). Then, the plunder of many nations will be divided. Even the lame and weak will seize the spoil and share in the plunder.

(Isaiah 33:24) 
And no resident in the land will say: 'I am sick' or 'I am weak.' The people who dwell in it will have their iniquity, their sins, taken away from them and forgiven.

(Isaiah 34:1) 
Approach, all you nations, and listen carefully.
All you peoples, pay attention.
Let the entire earth hear this, with all its inhabitants.
Let the whole world and everyone living on it understand.

(Isaiah 34:2) 
Because the Lord's strong anger is against all the nations,
and His fury is upon all their armies.
He will destroy them completely,
and hand them over to be slaughtered.

(Isaiah 34:3) 
Their dead bodies will be thrown out unburied.
A terrible stench will rise from their corpses.
The mountains will be soaked and appear to melt away from the vast amount of their blood.

(Isaiah 34:4) 
Then all the stars in the universe will dissolve,
and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll.
All the celestial bodies, like an army, will fall
just as leaves fall from a vine or from a fig tree.

(Isaiah 34:5) 
For My sword has been readied and made to strike in the spiritual realm of God.
Now, behold, it descends upon Edom,
and upon the people whom I have destined for utter destruction.

(Isaiah 34:6) 
The Lord's sword is completely drenched with blood;
it is heavy with fat,
from the blood of symbolic lambs and goats,
from the fat of symbolic rams and bulls.
For the Lord is offering a sacrifice of judgment in Bozrah,
and there will be a great slaughter throughout the land of Edom.

(Isaiah 34:7) 
And the wild oxen, with their great strength, will be brought down with them,
and the mighty bulls along with the wild cattle.
Their land will be drenched and made to drink their blood,
and their soil will be enriched with the fat of their powerful people, set apart for destruction.

(Isaiah 34:8) 
For this is the day of the Lord's vengeance,
the year of recompense, to bring justice for Zion.

(Isaiah 34:9) 
Then Edom's streams will be turned into burning tar,
and its soil into brimstone.
Its entire land will become a blazing inferno of tar.

(Isaiah 34:10) 
It will not be extinguished day or night;
its smoke will rise up forever.
From one generation to the next, it will remain a desolate wasteland.
No one will ever pass through it again, for all eternity.

(Isaiah 34:11) 
The pelican and the hedgehog will possess it.
The owl and the raven will make their home there.
God will stretch over it the measuring line of emptiness,
and the plummet of annihilation, ensuring its complete destruction.

(Isaiah 34:12) 
Her nobles will no longer be found there.
Indeed, there will be no one left to be her kings or princes either.

(Isaiah 34:13) 
Thorns will grow in her palaces,
and nettles and brambles in her fortresses.
It will become a lair for jackals,
and a dwelling place for ostriches.

(Isaiah 34:14) 
Wild demons will meet with howling hyenas;
and the hairy satyrs will cry out to one another.
There, the night hag will come to rest,
and find her own place of quiet.

(Isaiah 34:15) 
There the screech owl will make her nest, lay her eggs, hatch them,
and gather her young under her wings.
Indeed, kites will also gather there, one calling to another.

(Isaiah 34:16) 
Search diligently in the book of the Lord and read this carefully.
Not one of these prophecies will fail,
nor will any of these creatures be missing their mate or their place.
For the mouth of the Lord has commanded it,
and His very Spirit has gathered them together.

(Isaiah 34:17) 
God Himself has cast lots to determine their portion,
and His hand has measured out their inheritance for them.
They will possess that land forever,
and from generation to generation, they will dwell in it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:1) 
The deserted and pathless regions will rejoice. The solitary wilderness will be glad and will blossom like a lily, bursting forth in life.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:2) 
It will burst forth with abundant growth and will rejoice with overflowing gladness and praise. The splendor of Lebanon will be given to it, and the beauty of Carmel and Sharon. All the people there will see the glory of the Lord and the magnificent beauty of our God.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:3) 
Strengthen the feeble hands and make firm the weak knees.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:4) 
Say to those who are fainthearted: "Be strong, and do not be afraid! Behold, your God will come with divine justice and a just retribution. God Himself will come to rescue and save you."

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:5) 
Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened, and the ears of those who are deaf will be unstopped.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:6) 
Then the lame will leap like a stag, and the tongue of those who cannot speak will be made clear. For waters will burst forth in the deserted regions, and streams of water will flow in the solitary wilderness.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:7) 
The dry ground will be transformed into ponds, and the thirsty land into flowing springs of water. In the dens where wild beasts once lived, there will arise verdant reeds and rushes, turning their desolate homes into a lush swamp.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:8) 
And there will be a designated path and a true road there, and it will be called "the Holy Way." No unclean person will pass through it. This will be a straightforward path for you, so clear that even foolish people will not go astray on it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:9) 
No lion will be there, and no savage beast will go up on it or be found there. Only those who have been set free will walk upon it.

(Isaiah 35:Isaiah 35:10) 
And the Lord's redeemed people will return. They will come to Zion—the holy city of Jerusalem, their spiritual home—with praise, and with everlasting joy upon their heads. They will possess joy and gladness, and all sorrow and sighing will flee far away.

(Isaiah 36:1) 
It happened in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign: Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

(Isaiah 36:2) 
From Lachish, the Assyrian king sent Rabshakeh with a large army to Jerusalem, to confront King Hezekiah. Rabshakeh took his position by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road that leads to the Fuller's Field.

(Isaiah 36:3) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah and the steward of the king's household, along with Shebna the royal scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph and the recorder, went out to meet him.

(Isaiah 36:4) 
Rabshakeh spoke to them, saying: 'Tell Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What is this confidence you rely on? What gives you this certainty?'

(Isaiah 36:5) 
'Do you think you have a strategy and strength sufficient for battle? So, tell me, on whom are you relying now, since you have openly rebelled against me?'

(Isaiah 36:6) 
'Look, you are relying on Egypt, that broken reed staff. If a man leans on it, it will pierce his hand and wound it deeply. That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is to all who trust in him.'

(Isaiah 36:7) 
'But if you tell me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is He not the very One whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, when he commanded Judah and Jerusalem: "You shall worship before this altar only"?'

(Isaiah 36:8) 
'Now, make a pledge to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you can even find enough riders among yourselves for them.'

(Isaiah 36:9) 
'How then can you resist even one of the least of my master's officials? Yet you rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen.'

(Isaiah 36:10) 
'Furthermore, have I come up against this land to destroy it without the Lord's approval? The Lord Himself said to me: "Go up against this land and destroy it."'

(Isaiah 36:11) 
Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh: 'Please, speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah, where all the people listening on the wall can hear you.'

(Isaiah 36:12) 
But Rabshakeh replied: 'Did my master send me to speak all these words only to your master and to you? No, he sent me precisely to the men sitting on the wall, so that they will understand that soon they will be forced to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine with you, from the extreme hunger and thirst of the siege.'

(Isaiah 36:13) 
So Rabshakeh stood up and shouted with a loud voice in the language of Judah, saying: 'Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!'

(Isaiah 36:14) 
'Thus says the king: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will surely not be able to rescue you.'

(Isaiah 36:15) 
'Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, by saying: "The Lord will surely deliver us! This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."'

(Isaiah 36:16) 
'Do not listen to Hezekiah! For thus says the king of Assyria: Make a treaty with me and come out to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern.'

(Isaiah 36:17) 
'Until I come and take you away to a land just like your own land—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.'

(Isaiah 36:18) 
'Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us." Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?'

(Isaiah 36:19) 
'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?'

(Isaiah 36:20) 
'Which among all the gods of these lands have ever delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord should be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'

(Isaiah 36:21) 
But they remained silent and did not answer him a single word, because the king had given a command: 'Do not answer him.'

(Isaiah 36:22) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah and the steward of the king's household, along with Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph and the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in mourning, and they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.

(Isaiah 37:1) 
When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and wrapped himself in sackcloth, then he went into the Temple of the Lord.

(Isaiah 37:2) 
Hezekiah sent Eliacim, who was the steward of the royal palace, and Sobna the scribe, along with the elders of the priests. All of them were covered in sackcloth, and they went to Isaiah, the prophet and son of Amos.

(Isaiah 37:3) 
They said to him: "This is what King Hezekiah says: 'This day is full of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy. It is as if a child has come to the moment of birth, but there is no strength left for the mother to deliver it'—a metaphor for our complete helplessness.'

(Isaiah 37:4) 
"Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, sent to insult the living God and to scorn Him with the words that the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, please offer a prayer for the remnant of us who are still here and remain in Jerusalem."

(Isaiah 37:5) 
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

(Isaiah 37:6) 
And Isaiah said to them: "You shall say this to your master, King Hezekiah: 'This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard—the words with which the young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed and scorned me.'"

(Isaiah 37:7) 
"Behold, I will put a different spirit upon him, and he will hear a rumor, and he will return to his own land. And I will cause him to be struck down by a sword in his own land."

(Isaiah 37:8) 
So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had departed from Lachish.

(Isaiah 37:9) 
Then Sennacherib heard concerning Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, that he was coming out to fight against him. So when he heard this news, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah, saying:

(Isaiah 37:10) 
"You shall say this to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: 'Do not let your God, in whom you place your trust, deceive you by saying: Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'"

(Isaiah 37:11) 
"Behold, you yourself have heard all that the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, and how they utterly destroyed them. Do you truly think you will be able to escape and be delivered?"

(Isaiah 37:12) 
"Did the false gods of the nations, whom my fathers destroyed, deliver them—nations such as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?"

(Isaiah 37:13) 
"Where is the king of Hamath now, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivah?"

(Isaiah 37:14) 
And Hezekiah received the letters from the hands of the messengers and read them. Then he went up into the Temple of the Lord and spread the letters out before the Lord.

(Isaiah 37:15) 
And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:

(Isaiah 37:16) 
"O Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, You who sit enthroned above the Cherubim, You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You are the one who created the universe and the earth itself."

(Isaiah 37:17) 
"Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear. Open Your eyes, O Lord, and see. Hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to blaspheme the living God."

(Isaiah 37:18) 
"It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have laid waste the lands and their territories."

(Isaiah 37:19) 
"And they threw the gods of those nations into the fire, because they were not true gods, but merely the work of human hands—objects of wood and stone. And so the Assyrians utterly destroyed them."

(Isaiah 37:20) 
"And now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are the Lord."

(Isaiah 37:21) 
Then Isaiah, the son of Amos, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib, the king of Assyria—'"

(Isaiah 37:22) 
"These are the words that the Lord has spoken about him: 'The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you as you depart.'"

(Isaiah 37:23) 
"Whom have you scorned and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, and lifted your eyes arrogantly on high? It was against the Holy One of Israel."

(Isaiah 37:24) 
"By the hand of your servants, you have insulted the Lord, and you have said: 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended to the highest peaks of the mountains, to the very top of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest fir trees. I will reach its highest summit, even its densest forest of Carmel.'"

(Isaiah 37:25) 
"I myself have dug wells and drunk water. And with the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the rivers meant to protect the besieged cities."

(Isaiah 37:26) 
"Have you not heard that I—the Lord—ordained this long ago? From ancient days I formed this plan. Now I have brought it to pass, and you have become the instrument for laying waste fortified cities and their defensive mounds."

(Isaiah 37:27) 
"And the inhabitants of those lands were weakened, dismayed, and utterly confounded. They became like the grass of the field, or the plants of the pasture, or the vegetation on the housetops that withers away before it can even mature."

(Isaiah 37:28) 
"I know your resting place, your going out, your coming in, and the path you take, and your furious rage against me."

(Isaiah 37:29) 
"Because you have raged violently against me, and your arrogance has risen to reach my ears, I will put a hook in your nose and a bridle in your mouth, and I will lead you back by the very way you came."

(Isaiah 37:30) 
"And this will be a sign for you, O Hezekiah: This year, you shall eat what grows of itself. In the second year, you shall eat what grows from the first year's harvest. But in the third year, you shall sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."

(Isaiah 37:31) 
"And the remnant that has escaped from the house of Judah, that which remains, shall again take deep root below and bear fruit above."

(Isaiah 37:32) 
"For out of Jerusalem will come forth a remnant, and from Mount Zion will come those who are saved. The fervent zeal of the Lord of Armies will accomplish this."

(Isaiah 37:33) 
"Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor approach it with a shield, nor build a siege ramp against it."

(Isaiah 37:34) 
"By the very road on which he came, he will return. He shall not enter this city, declares the Lord."

(Isaiah 37:35) 
"And I will protect this city and deliver it, for my own sake and for the sake of David, my faithful servant."

(Isaiah 37:36) 
Then the Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead bodies.

(Isaiah 37:37) 
So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, departed and went away. He returned home and settled in Nineveh.

(Isaiah 37:38) 
While he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his pagan god, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with a sword. Then they fled into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place as king.

(Isaiah 38:1) 
In those days, King Hezekiah became very sick, so sick that he was going to die. Isaiah, the son of Amos, who was a prophet of God, came to him and said, "This is what the Lord God says: 'Put your affairs in order—prepare your household for your death—for you will surely die and not live.'"

(Isaiah 38:2) 
When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face toward the wall and began to pray to the Lord God.

(Isaiah 38:3) 
And Hezekiah prayed, saying, "Oh Lord, I beg you, please remember how I have lived before you—I have always walked honestly and with a complete heart, and I have done what you found pleasing." Then Hezekiah wept with great sorrow.

(Isaiah 38:4) 
Then the word of the Lord God came to Isaiah, saying:

(Isaiah 38:5) 
"Go and tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the Lord God, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Now, behold, I will add fifteen more years to your life.

(Isaiah 38:6) 
And I will rescue you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria, and I will protect this city.'"

(Isaiah 38:7) 
And this will be your sign from the Lord God, that the Lord God will indeed do this thing that He has spoken.

(Isaiah 38:8) 
"Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps of Ahaz's sundial—the steps by which it had already descended—to go back ten steps." And the sun's shadow on the sundial did indeed go back ten steps from where it had descended, demonstrating God's power over time.

(Isaiah 38:9) 
This is a written prayer and record by King Hezekiah of Judah, composed after he had been sick and then had recovered from his illness.

(Isaiah 38:10) 
I had said to myself, "In the middle of my life, I will go down to the gates of the grave—the realm of the dead. I thought I would be deprived of the rest of my years."

(Isaiah 38:11) 
I said, "I will no longer see the Lord God in the land of the living. I will not look upon another human being, nor dwell among those who live in the world anymore."

(Isaiah 38:12) 
My generation has been taken away, and my life has been folded up from me like a shepherd's tent. My life has been cut off like a weaver's thread from the loom; while I was still weaving it, He cut me off. From the morning until the evening, you will bring my life to an end.

(Isaiah 38:13) 
I waited patiently until morning, but like a lion, God crushed all my bones. From the morning until the evening, you will bring my life to an end.

(Isaiah 38:14) 
I chirped like a young swallow, and I mourned like a dove. My eyes grew dim from looking upward, constantly begging for help. Lord, I am suffering great violence and oppression—please answer for me.

(Isaiah 38:15) 
What can I say? What will He answer me when He Himself has done this—permitted this to happen? I will remember all my past years in the bitterness of my soul.

(Isaiah 38:16) 
O Lord, if this is how life is lived by men, and if my spirit's life finds its perfection and purpose in such experiences, then you have healed me and given me life again.

(Isaiah 38:17) 
Behold, in my peace—in my supposed rest—my bitterness was most bitter. But you, O Lord, have rescued my soul so that it would not perish; you have cast all my sins behind your back, completely removing them from your sight.

(Isaiah 38:18) 
For the realm of the dead will not give thanks to you, nor will death praise you. Those who descend into the pit—into the grave—will not hope for your truth.

(Isaiah 38:19) 
The living, yes, the living, will give thanks to you, just as I do today. A father will make your truth known to his children.

(Isaiah 38:20) 
O Lord, save me! And we will sing our psalms all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord God.

(Isaiah 38:21) 
And Isaiah said, "Bring a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, and he will recover."

(Isaiah 38:22) 
Then Hezekiah asked, "What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord God again?"

(Isaiah 39:39:1) 
In that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, who was the king of Babylon, sent letters and gifts to King Hezekiah. This was because he had heard that Hezekiah had become ill and then recovered.

(Isaiah 39:39:2) 
King Hezekiah was greatly pleased by their visit and gifts, and he showed them everything in his royal treasury. He revealed his silver, his gold, all his spices, the finest oils, and all the furnishings within his palace. Hezekiah held nothing back from them from his treasures or from all that was under his authority.

(Isaiah 39:39:3) 
After this, the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him: 'What did those men say to you? And where did they come from to reach you?' Hezekiah responded: 'They came to me from a very distant land, from Babylon.'

(Isaiah 39:39:4) 
Isaiah then asked: 'What did they see in your royal palace?' Hezekiah replied: 'They saw everything that is in my house; there was nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.'

(Isaiah 39:39:5) 
Then Isaiah spoke to Hezekiah: 'Listen closely to the message from the Lord of armies.'

(Isaiah 39:39:6) 
Indeed, the days are coming when everything in your royal palace, and all the riches your ancestors have accumulated until this very day, will be taken away to Babylon. Nothing will be left behind, declares the Lord God.

(Isaiah 39:39:7) 
And some of your own sons, those who will be born to you and descend from you, will be taken away. They will be made eunuchs and forced to serve in the palace of the king of Babylon.

(Isaiah 39:39:8) 
Hezekiah responded to Isaiah: 'The message from the Lord God that you have spoken is good.' He then added: 'At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime.'

(Isaiah 40:1) 
“Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God, calling them to be consoled.

(Isaiah 40:2) 
Speak directly and tenderly to Jerusalem; tell her that her time of suffering has been completed. Her iniquity has been forgiven, for she has received from the Lord’s hand a double portion of recompense for all her sins.

(Isaiah 40:3) 
There is a voice of one calling out in the wilderness, saying: “Prepare the road for the Lord! Make the pathways of our God straight in the barren lands!”

(Isaiah 40:4) 
Every low valley will be elevated, and every mountain and hill will be made low. The twisted roads will become straight, and the rough, uneven ground will become smooth pathways.

(Isaiah 40:5) 
And then the radiant glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all humanity will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord God has spoken this truth.

(Isaiah 40:6) 
A voice then commanded: “Cry out!” And I answered: “What message should I proclaim?” The voice responded: “All human beings are as fleeting as grass, and all their earthly splendor is like a fragile wildflower.”

(Isaiah 40:7) 
The grass dries up, and the flower fades away, because the breath of the Lord (like a strong wind) blows over it. Indeed, human beings are as transient as grass.

(Isaiah 40:8) 
The grass dries up, and the flower fades away, but the word and eternal decree of our God remains for all eternity.

(Isaiah 40:9) 
Go up onto a high mountain, you who bring the good news of salvation to Sion! Raise your voice with all your strength, you who proclaim the good news to Jerusalem! Raise it up without fear! Say to the cities of Judah: “Behold, here is your God!”

(Isaiah 40:10) 
Behold, the Lord God will come with overwhelming power, and His mighty arm will have dominion. Behold, His eternal reward is with Him, and His works of salvation are before His face.

(Isaiah 40:11) 
Like a shepherd, He will feed His flock. He will gather the young lambs with His arm and carry them close to His chest, and He Himself will gently lead the ewes that are pregnant or nursing.

(Isaiah 40:12) 
Who has ever measured the waters of the deep in the hollow of His hand, or weighed the entire universe with His palm? Who has measured the mass of the earth with just three fingers, or balanced the mountains on scales and the hills in a balance?

(Isaiah 40:13) 
Who has ever guided the Spirit of the Lord, or who has served as His advisor and taught Him how to act?

(Isaiah 40:14) 
From whom did He receive advice, and who instructed Him, teaching Him the path of righteousness? Who imparted knowledge to Him, and showed Him the way of true understanding?

(Isaiah 40:15) 
Behold, all the nations of the world are like a single drop falling from a bucket, and they are regarded as nothing more than the fine dust that barely registers on a balance scale. Behold, even the great islands are like tiny specks of dust.

(Isaiah 40:16) 
Even the vast forests of Lebanon would not provide enough wood for a fire offering, and its multitude of animals would not be sufficient for a single burnt sacrifice worthy of God.

(Isaiah 40:17) 
All the nations, in His sight, are as if they do not exist. They are accounted as nothing, utterly empty and void of substance.

(Isaiah 40:18) 
To whom, then, will you compare God? Or what created image will you set up as His likeness?

(Isaiah 40:19) 
Can you liken Him to a carved idol? A craftsman casts a statue, and a goldsmith then covers it with plates of gold, while a silversmith fashions silver plates for it.

(Isaiah 40:20) 
One who is too poor to afford metal chooses a piece of wood that will not rot, then seeks a skilled craftsman to prepare an idol that will stand firm and not topple over.

(Isaiah 40:21) 
Do you not know these truths? Have you not heard them proclaimed? Has it not been announced to you from the very beginning of time? Have you not understood the fundamental truth of God’s creation of the entire earth?

(Isaiah 40:22) 
It is He who is enthroned above the spherical earth, and its inhabitants appear before Him like tiny locusts. He effortlessly stretches out the universe as if it were a fine curtain, and spreads it out like a vast tent for habitation.

(Isaiah 40:23) 
He brings the powerful judges and rulers of the world to utter nothingness. He renders the governors of the earth as empty and without substance.

(Isaiah 40:24) 
Indeed, they are neither planted like a tree, nor sown like a seed, nor is their lineage deeply rooted in the earth. Suddenly, He breathes a powerful wind upon them, and they instantly wither away. A whirlwind then carries them off like light stubble.

(Isaiah 40:25) 
“To whom then can you possibly compare Me, or whom will you consider My equal?” says the Holy One of God.

(Isaiah 40:26) 
Lift up your eyes to the cosmic expanse above, and see who created all these things: He who brings out their starry host by number, and calls each one by its unique name. Because of the immensity of His strength, His might, and His power, not one star is missing.

(Isaiah 40:27) 
Why do you complain, O Jacob, and why do you say, O Israel: “My path and my struggles are hidden from the Lord, and my rightful cause is ignored by my God?”

(Isaiah 40:28) 
Do you not know this, or have you not heard? The Lord is the eternal God, the Creator of the entire earth. He does not grow faint, nor does He become weary. His wisdom and understanding are utterly beyond our ability to comprehend.

(Isaiah 40:29) 
He grants strength and vigor to the weary, and He multiplies the might of those who have no power of their own.

(Isaiah 40:30) 
Even the strongest young men will grow weary and faint, and the most robust youths will utterly stumble and fall.

(Isaiah 40:31) 
But those who place their hope and trust in the Lord will find their strength renewed. They will soar on high with wings like eagles, they will run a race and not grow weary, they will walk a long journey and not faint.

(Isaiah 41:1) 
Be silent before Me, you distant lands and coastal regions. Let the nations renew their strength and their resolve. Let them come forward and then speak. Let us all approach together to make our case before judgment.

(Isaiah 41:2) 
Who has raised up from the East a righteous man? Who called him to follow God's will and purpose? Who gave nations into his view, enabling him to humble kings? He will make their armies like dust to his sword, and their forces like stubble scattered by the wind to his bow.

(Isaiah 41:3) 
He will pursue them and pass onward in peace, on a path where his own foot has never walked before—a path made easy by God.

(Isaiah 41:4) 
Who has worked and accomplished these things? Who has called forth all the generations of humanity from the very beginning of time? I am the Lord, the First and the Last, I am He.

(Isaiah 41:5) 
The distant lands saw what happened and became afraid. The farthest regions of the earth were astonished; they drew near and came together.

(Isaiah 41:6) 
Everyone helped his neighbor, and each one said to his brother: 'Take courage! Be strong!'

(Isaiah 41:7) 
The metal craftsman encouraged the goldsmith, who was hammering the idol with his mallet, saying: 'This joining is good!' And he fastened it with nails so that it would not fall or move.

(Isaiah 41:8) 
But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, My beloved friend.

(Isaiah 41:9) 
I have taken you from the very ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I have said to you: 'You are My chosen servant; I have called you, and I have never cast you away.'

(Isaiah 41:10) 
Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be dismayed or look around for help, for I am your God. I have strengthened you and helped you. I have sustained you with the triumphant right hand of My justice.

(Isaiah 41:11) 
Behold, all those who fight against you will be utterly put to shame and disgraced. They will be reduced to nothing and will perish, the men who strive against you.

(Isaiah 41:12) 
You will search for them, but you will not find those who rebelled against you. They will become as if they never existed, and those who waged war against you will be reduced to nothing.

(Isaiah 41:13) 
For I am the Lord your God, holding your right hand firmly, and saying to you: 'Do not fear; I Myself have helped you.'

(Isaiah 41:14) 
Do not be afraid, you humbled people of Jacob, you seemingly insignificant ones from Israel. I Myself have helped you, says the Lord. And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 41:15) 
Behold, I will make you like a new threshing sledge, equipped with sharp, serrated teeth. You will thresh mountains and crush them, reducing the hills to mere dust.

(Isaiah 41:16) 
You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and a strong gale will scatter them. And you yourself will rejoice triumphantly in the Lord, you will find your joy in the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 41:17) 
The poor and the needy are searching for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the Lord, will certainly hear their cries. I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them.

(Isaiah 41:18) 
I will open rivers on the barren heights and springs in the middle of the valleys. I will transform the desert into refreshing pools of water, and the thirsty ground into gushing springs.

(Isaiah 41:19) 
I will plant in the barren wilderness the cedar, the acacia (also called the shittah tree), the myrtle, and the olive tree. I will set in the desert the fir, the elm, and the boxwood all together.

(Isaiah 41:20) 
So that all people may see and fully know, consider deeply, and understand together that the hand of the Lord God has accomplished this, and the Holy One of Israel Himself has created these things.

(Isaiah 41:21) 
Present your case for your gods, says the Lord. Bring forth all your strongest arguments, says the King of Jacob.

(Isaiah 41:22) 
Let your false gods come forward and tell us whatever things are yet to come. Declare to us the events of the past and explain their meaning, so that we may ponder them and understand their ultimate outcome. Or, even better, announce to us the things that are yet to come!

(Isaiah 41:23) 
Announce the things that will happen in the distant future, and then we will know that you truly are gods. Do something good, or do something evil—anything at all—so that we may understand and see it together as evidence.

(Isaiah 41:24) 
Behold, you false gods are absolutely nothing, and anything you do or claim to do is equally nothing. Whoever chooses to worship you is an abomination.

(Isaiah 41:25) 
I have raised up a ruler from the north, and he will come. From the rising of the sun (the East), I will declare his name, and he will bring down rulers and officials as if they were mere mud, trampling them down like a potter treads clay.

(Isaiah 41:26) 
Which of your false gods has announced these things from the beginning, so that we might know? Which of them foretold events long ago, so that we might say: 'He is righteous and true'? There is no one among them who declares anything, no one who proclaims, and no one who even hears your words.

(Isaiah 41:27) 
I, the Lord, am the First to say to Sion: 'Behold, the promised events are already here!' And to Jerusalem, I will send a messenger who brings good news and proclaims it.

(Isaiah 41:28) 
And I, the Lord, looked, and there was not a single one among their idols or their prophets who could give any counsel, or who could answer a single word when asked.

(Isaiah 41:29) 
Behold, all of these idols are empty and worthless. Their works are absolutely nothing, and their sculpted images are mere wind and empty air.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:1) 
Look at My Servant. I uphold Him. He is My chosen one, and my very soul is delighted by Him. I have given My Spirit to rest upon Him; He will bring forth justice to all the nations of the world.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:2) 
He will not shout for attention, nor will He raise His voice in a boastful way. His voice will not be heard loudly in the public squares.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:3) 
He will not break the weakest and most fragile among us, like a bruised reed. He will not extinguish a flickering flame, like a smoldering wick —He will preserve and restore even the weakest. He will faithfully bring forth justice, upholding the truth.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:4) 
He will not grow faint, nor will He be discouraged, until He has established true justice on the earth. Even the distant lands and all the islands will eagerly await His teaching and His law.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:5) 
This is what the Lord God says—He who created the entire universe and stretched out its vastness, He who established the Earth and all that grows from it, He who gives the very breath of life to all people upon it, and the spirit of life to all who walk on its surface.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:6) 
I, the Lord, have called you—My Servant—in righteousness, and I have taken hold of your hand. I have preserved you, and I have given you to be a New Covenant for all people, and a light to all the nations of the world.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:7) 
So that you would open the eyes of those who are spiritually blind. So that you would lead the bound captives out of their confinement. So that you would bring those who sit in the darkness of the prison house into the light.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:8) 
I am the Lord—this is My Name, the name above all names. I will not give My glory to any other, nor will I give the praise due to Me to idols or carved images.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:9) 
Look, the former prophecies have already come to pass. Now I am announcing new things to you. Even before they come into being, I will cause you to hear about them.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:10) 
Sing a new song to the Lord. Let His praise resound from the uttermost ends of the Earth. Let all those who sail on the sea, and everything that fills it—every island, and all their inhabitants—sing praises.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:11) 
Let the desert lands and all their cities lift up their voices in praise. Let the inhabitants of the tents of Kedar rejoice. Let those who dwell in the rock fortresses praise Him. Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:12) 
Let them give all glory to the Lord, and let them declare His praise throughout all the islands.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:13) 
The Lord will go forth like a mighty warrior. He will stir up His holy zeal like a man of war. He will shout His battle cry and cry aloud. He will show His great power over all His enemies.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:14) 
I have been silent for a long time. I have been still and have patiently held Myself back. Now, like a woman in childbirth, I will cry out—I will pant and gasp, and I will destroy and consume all at once.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:15) 
I will lay waste to the mountains and the hills, and I will dry up all their vegetation. I will turn rivers into dry land, like islands, and I will dry up all the stagnant pools.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:16) 
And I will lead those who are spiritually blind in a way they do not know. I will make them walk in paths they have not known before. I will turn the darkness before them into brilliant light, and I will make the crooked paths straight. These are the things I have done for them, and I have not forsaken them.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:17) 
But those who have turned back to their idols will be utterly put to shame. Those who trust in carved images and those who say to molten images, “You are our gods”—they will be confused and humiliated.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:18) 
Listen, you who are spiritually deaf. Look intently, you who are spiritually blind, so that you may truly see.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:19) 
Who is truly blind, except My servant Israel? Who is truly deaf, except the one to whom I have sent My messenger, the prophet? Who is truly blind, except he who has betrayed Me and been given over to his enemies? And who is truly blind, except this servant of the Lord?

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:20) 
You have seen many wonderful things, yet you did not pay attention. You have opened your ears, yet you did not truly hear.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:21) 
The Lord, because of His own perfect righteousness, was pleased to make His law magnificent and to bring it great honor.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:22) 
But this same people—Israel—has been plundered and ravaged. All of them are trapped in snares, and they are hidden away in prison cells. They have become prey, and there is no one to rescue them. They have been plundered, and there is no one who says, “Give it back!”

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:23) 
Who among you will truly listen to this warning? Who will pay attention and truly hear what I am saying about your future?

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:24) 
Who handed Jacob over to be plundered, and Israel over to the robbers? Was it not the Lord Himself, against whom we have sinned? For they were unwilling to walk in His ways, and they refused to listen to His law.

(Isaiah 42:Isaiah 42:25) 
So He poured out upon Israel the heat of His fierce anger and the might of a terrible war. It burned all around them, yet they did not recognize its divine cause. It consumed them with fire, yet they did not understand the meaning of it.

(Isaiah 43:1) 
And now, the Lord who created you, Jacob, and who formed you, Israel, says these things: "Do not be afraid, for I have rescued you, and I have called you by your very own name. You are Mine, My special possession."

(Isaiah 43:2) 
When you pass through difficult waters, I will be with you; even mighty rivers will not overwhelm you. When you walk through fiery trials, you will not be burned, and the flame will not scorch you.

(Isaiah 43:3) 
For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. As a ransom and a price for your freedom, I have given Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba for you.

(Isaiah 43:4) 
Since you became precious and glorious in My eyes, I have loved you. I will give other people in exchange for you, and entire nations for the sake of your life.

(Isaiah 43:5) 
Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bring your descendants from the east, and I will gather you from the west.

(Isaiah 43:6) 
I will say to the north: 'Give them up!' And to the south: 'Do not hold them back!' Bring My sons from distant lands, and My daughters from the farthest ends of the earth.

(Isaiah 43:7) 
Every person who invokes My name, I created them for My glory. I formed them, and I made them for this very purpose.

(Isaiah 43:8) 
Bring forth the people who are spiritually blind, though they possess physical eyes. Bring forth the people who are spiritually deaf, though they have physical ears.

(Isaiah 43:9) 
All the nations have gathered together, and the peoples have assembled. Who among them can declare what is coming, and who can tell us what happened in the distant past? Let them bring their witnesses to justify themselves, so that they may hear and truly say: 'It is true!'

(Isaiah 43:10) 
You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and My chosen servant. This is so that you may know Me, and believe in Me, and truly understand that I am He—the one true God. No other god was formed before Me, and no other god will exist after Me.

(Isaiah 43:11) 
I, even I, am the Lord, and there is no other savior besides Me.

(Isaiah 43:12) 
I am the one who declared the future, and I am the one who brought salvation. I made it known to you, and there was no foreign god among you to do these things. You are My witnesses, says the Lord, and I am God.

(Isaiah 43:13) 
From the very beginning of all things, I am He. There is no one who can rescue anything from My hand. When I choose to act, who can possibly stop or reverse it?

(Isaiah 43:14) 
The Lord, your Rescuer, the Holy One of Israel, says these things: 'For your sake, I have sent forces against Babylon. I will bring down all its defensive bars and gates, and bring ruin to the Chaldeans who boast in their ships.'

(Isaiah 43:15) 
I am the Lord, your Holy One, the One who created Israel, your King.

(Isaiah 43:16) 
The Lord, who made a path through the sea (as in the Exodus), and a way through raging waters, says these things.

(Isaiah 43:17) 
He is the One who led out chariots, horses, and a powerful, mighty army, (referring to the Egyptians). They all lay down together in death and did not rise again. They were crushed and extinguished like a wick of flax.

(Isaiah 43:18) 
Do not dwell on the past events; do not keep thinking about the ancient things.

(Isaiah 43:19) 
Behold, I am now doing something new, and it is already springing forth. Will you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness, and I will create rivers in desolate places.

(Isaiah 43:20) 
The wild beasts of the field will honor Me, even the jackals and the ostriches, because I provide waters in the wilderness and rivers in desolate lands. I do this to give drink to My people, My chosen ones.

(Isaiah 43:21) 
This people I formed and made for Myself; they will proclaim My praise and declare My story to the world.

(Isaiah 43:22) 
But you have not called upon Me, Jacob. And you have not toiled in worship or service for Me, Israel.

(Isaiah 43:23) 
You did not bring Me a ram for your burnt offering, nor did you glorify Me with your animal sacrifices. I did not burden you with grain offerings, nor did I impose upon you the toil of providing incense.

(Isaiah 43:24) 
You did not buy Me sweet cane (for incense) with silver, nor did you satisfy Me with the fat of your sacrifices. Instead, you have made Me serve you with your sins, and you have burdened Me with your iniquities.

(Isaiah 43:25) 
I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, because of My own nature and honor. And I will not remember your sins anymore.

(Isaiah 43:26) 
Challenge Me to a trial: present your case. Tell Me if you have anything to justify yourself.

(Isaiah 43:27) 
Your first ancestral father sinned, and your own spokesmen and mediators have rebelled against Me.

(Isaiah 43:28) 
Therefore, I have profaned your holy princes, and I have given Jacob over to utter destruction, and Israel to disgrace and reproach.

(Isaiah 44:1) 
And now, listen, Jacob, My servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.

(Isaiah 44:2) 
This is what the Lord says, He who made you and formed you from the womb, your helper: Do not fear, My servant Jacob, and be steadfast, Israel, whom I have chosen.

(Isaiah 44:3) 
For I will pour refreshing waters upon the thirsty, and abundant streams upon the dry land; I will pour My Spirit upon your offspring, and My blessing upon your descendants.

(Isaiah 44:4) 
And they will grow up quickly, like grass among other plants, like willows next to flowing water.

(Isaiah 44:5) 
One person will say: 'I belong to the Lord.' Another will declare himself by the name of Jacob. Another will write with his own hand, 'I am the Lord's,' and will be called by the name of Israel.

(Isaiah 44:6) 
This is what the Lord, the King of Israel, says, and its Redeemer, the Lord of all creation: I am the first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no God.

(Isaiah 44:7) 
And who is like Me? Let him call out, and let him declare; let him set forth his claims to Me—from the time I established the ancient people—and let them announce to you the things to come and what will happen.

(Isaiah 44:8) 
Do not fear, nor be troubled. Have I not made you hear and proclaimed these things from that time? Is it not true that I am from the beginning, and there is no God besides Me? There is no other 'rock'—no other false god—that I do not know exists.

(Isaiah 44:9) 
All who make idols are worthless, and their most cherished creations will not profit them. These idol-makers themselves are witnesses that the idols neither see nor understand, so that those who worship them may be put to shame.

(Isaiah 44:10) 
Who formed a god? And who cast a graven image that does absolutely nothing?

(Isaiah 44:11) 
Behold, all who participate in this will be put to shame. The craftsmen are merely human beings. Let them all gather, let them stand forth, and let them be terrified, and together be utterly confounded.

(Isaiah 44:12) 
The blacksmith works with a file, heating it in coals; with hammers he shapes it. He works with the full strength of his arm, but eventually, he hungers and grows faint. He drinks water and becomes weary.

(Isaiah 44:13) 
The wood craftsman stretches out his measuring line, and with a marking tool he sketches it out. He makes it with corners, and with a compass he rounds it. He then fashions an image of a man, as if of a handsome man, and sets it up to sit in a house.

(Isaiah 44:14) 
He cuts down cedars for himself; he takes a holm oak and an oak that grew among the trees of the forest. He plants a pine tree, and the rain nourishes it.

(Isaiah 44:15) 
And some of it will be for a man as fuel. He takes part of it to warm himself, and he kindles it and bakes bread. But from the rest of it, he makes a god and worships it. He carves an idol and bows down before it.

(Isaiah 44:16) 
Half of the wood he burns in the fire, and with it he cooks meat; he roasts his roast and is satisfied. He gets warm and says: 'Ah, I am warm! I have seen the fire!'

(Isaiah 44:17) 
And the rest of it he makes into a god, into a carved image for himself. He bows down before it, and worships, and implores it, saying: 'Save me, for you are my god!'

(Isaiah 44:18) 
They have neither known nor understood, for their eyes are covered so that they cannot see, and their hearts cannot understand.

(Isaiah 44:19) 
Such a person does not think in his mind, nor does he know or understand enough to say: 'I burned half of it with fire, and I baked bread over its coals. I roasted meat and ate it. And from the rest of it, shall I make an idol? Shall I prostrate myself before a mere block of wood?'

(Isaiah 44:20) 
His heart feeds on ashes. He has wandered astray in his mind and cannot deliver his soul, nor can he even recognize and say: 'Surely, there is a lie in my right hand!'

(Isaiah 44:21) 
Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, because you are My servant. I formed you, you are My servant. Israel, do not forget Me.

(Isaiah 44:22) 
I have blotted out your iniquities like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, because I have redeemed you.

(Isaiah 44:23) 
Praise, O heavens, because the Lord has accomplished this! Shout for joy, mountains, and offer praise! Let the forests and every tree in them rejoice! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and Israel will glorify Him!

(Isaiah 44:24) 
This is what the Lord, your Redeemer, says, and He who formed you from the womb: I am the Lord, who makes all things, who stretches out the universe alone, who establishes the earth, and no one was with Me.

(Isaiah 44:25) 
It is I who frustrate the signs of diviners and make fortune-tellers seem like fools. I am He who turns the wise backward and makes their knowledge seem foolish.

(Isaiah 44:26) 
It is I who confirm the word of My servant and fulfill the counsel of My messengers. I am He who says to Jerusalem: 'You shall be built!' and to the cities of Judah: 'You shall be rebuilt!' and I will raise up its desolate places.

(Isaiah 44:27) 
It is I who say to the deep waters: 'Be desolate!' and 'I will dry up your rivers!'

(Isaiah 44:28) 
It is I who say to Cyrus: 'You are My shepherd, and you shall fulfill all My will!' I am He who says to Jerusalem: 'You shall be built!' and to the Temple: 'You shall be founded!'

(Isaiah 45:45:1) 
This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, His anointed one—His chosen instrument, whom I have grasped by his right hand. I have empowered him to subdue nations before him, to make kings turn and flee, and to open city gates before him so that no city gates can be shut against him.

(Isaiah 45:45:2) 
I Myself will go before you, Cyrus, and bring down the mighty rulers of the earth. I will shatter gates of bronze and break into pieces the iron bars of cities.

(Isaiah 45:45:3) 
I will give you hidden treasures and the secret riches stored away in the dark places of conquered cities, so that you may know that I am the Lord. I am the One who calls you by your name, the God of Israel.

(Isaiah 45:45:4) 
It is for the sake of My servant Jacob, for the sake of Israel, My chosen people, that I have called you, Cyrus, by your name and given you a significant title and purpose—even though you do not know Me personally.

(Isaiah 45:45:5) 
I am the Lord, and there is no other God besides Me. There is absolutely no other God. I have armed you and prepared you for your mission, Cyrus, even though you have not known Me.

(Isaiah 45:45:6) 
I do this so that from the rising of the sun to its setting—throughout the entire world—people will know that there is no God besides Me. I am the Lord, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:7) 
I am the One who forms light and creates darkness, just as in the beginning of the universe. I am the One who brings about peace and allows calamity to occur for My purposes. I am the Lord who does all these things.

(Isaiah 45:45:8) 
Let the skies shower down from above, and let the clouds rain down the Righteous One. Let the earth open up and bring forth a Savior, and let righteousness spring up alongside Him. I, the Lord, have created all of this.

(Isaiah 45:45:9) 
Woe to the one who argues with his Maker—a mere piece of pottery among the earthen vessels! Does the clay say to its potter, 'What are you making?' or 'Your work lacks skill!'

(Isaiah 45:45:10) 
Woe to the one who says to a father, 'What kind of child are you bringing into the world?' and to a mother, 'What are you bringing forth in childbirth?'

(Isaiah 45:45:11) 
This is what the Lord says—the Holy One of Israel, your Maker and Former: 'Do you question Me about the future concerning My children? And do you presume to command Me concerning the work of My hands?'

(Isaiah 45:45:12) 
I Myself made the earth, and I created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the universe, and I gave commands to all the stars and celestial bodies within it.

(Isaiah 45:45:13) 
I have raised him up—Cyrus—for a righteous purpose, and I will make all his paths straight. He will command the rebuilding of My city, Jerusalem, and he will release My captive people, the Israelites, not for any ransom or bribe, says the Lord of hosts.

(Isaiah 45:45:14) 
This is what the Lord says: 'The wealth of Egypt and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the tall men of Saba, shall come over to you, O Israel, and be yours. They shall follow behind you, coming over to you in chains of submission. They will bow down to you and plead with you, declaring: "Surely, God is only found with you, and there is no other God besides Him! There is absolutely no other God!"'

(Isaiah 45:45:15) 
Truly, You are a God who remains hidden in Your ways, O God of Israel, our Savior.

(Isaiah 45:45:16) 
All those who worship idols will be confused and ashamed. Together, the makers of false gods will go into confusion and disgrace.

(Isaiah 45:45:17) 
But Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation. You will never be put to shame or disgraced, for all eternity.

(Isaiah 45:45:18) 
For this is what the Lord says—the One who created the universe. He is God, the One who formed the earth, made it, and established it firmly. He did not create it to be a formless void or empty chaos; He formed it specifically to be inhabited. I am the Lord, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:19) 
I have not spoken in secret ways, nor from a dark, hidden place of the earth. I have not said to the descendants of Jacob, 'Seek Me in vain.' I am the Lord, speaking truth and declaring what is right.

(Isaiah 45:45:20) 
Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, you who have been rescued from the nations! They have no knowledge—those who carry around their wooden idols and pray to a god that is powerless to save them.

(Isaiah 45:45:21) 
Declare it, and come forth, and consult together among yourselves! Who has declared these things from the beginning, from ancient times, and foretold them? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me. There is no just God and no Savior apart from Me.

(Isaiah 45:45:22) 
Turn to Me, and be saved, all you ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other God.

(Isaiah 45:45:23) 
I have sworn by My very Self; a word of righteousness has gone out from My mouth, and it will not return to Me unfulfilled: 'For to Me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear allegiance.'

(Isaiah 45:45:24) 
Surely, in the Lord alone, they will say, 'I have righteousness and strength.' To Him shall they come, and all who raged against Him will be put to shame.

(Isaiah 45:45:25) 
In the Lord, all the descendants of Israel shall be justified, and they shall glory and praise Him.

(Isaiah 46:1) 
The idol god Bel has bowed down low, and the idol god Nebo has also stooped low. Their carved images, which you thought were gods, are now merely carried away on the backs of beasts of burden and other animals. These images are a heavy, tiring load for the animals carrying them.

(Isaiah 46:2) 
Both Bel and Nebo have stooped and bowed together, defeated. They could not even save the one who carried their images, nor could they protect the people who worshipped them. The very souls of their devotees will be led away into captivity.

(Isaiah 46:3) 
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and every last one of you from the house of Israel: I am the One who has carried you from your mother’s womb; I am the One who has borne you from the moment you were conceived.

(Isaiah 46:4) 
Even as you grow old, I Myself will be with you; even until your hair turns gray, I will carry you. I am the One who made you, and I am the One who will continue to bear your burdens. I will carry you, and I will save you.

(Isaiah 46:5) 
To whom could you possibly compare Me? Who could you make My equal, or match Me against? Who could you claim is similar to Me?

(Isaiah 46:6) 
Look at those who pour out gold from their money pouches and weigh silver on a scale. They pay a craftsman good wages to shape this metal into what they call a 'god,' and then they worship it and bow down to it.

(Isaiah 46:7) 
They have to carry it on their shoulders and bear its weight. Then they place it in its specific spot, and there it stands, unable to move from that place on its own. If they cry out to it for help, it cannot hear them, nor can it save them from any distress.

(Isaiah 46:8) 
Remember these things, and consider how foolish they are, and be ashamed. Return to your senses, you transgressors, and truly reflect on your hearts.

(Isaiah 46:9) 
Remember the events of ancient ages, for I am God, and there is no other God besides Me. There is absolutely no one like Me in all of existence.

(Isaiah 46:10) 
I am the One who declares the very end from the beginning of all things, and I announce from ancient times events that have not yet even occurred. I alone declare, 'My divine plan will stand, and My entire will shall be accomplished.'

(Isaiah 46:11) 
I am calling a swift bird from the east, and from a far-off land, I am calling forth the man of My divine counsel. I have declared this, and I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, and I will surely accomplish it.

(Isaiah 46:12) 
Listen to me, you who are hardened of heart, those of you who are far away from true righteousness.

(Isaiah 46:13) 
I have brought My righteousness near to you; it will not remain distant. My salvation will not be delayed. And I will grant salvation in Zion, and bestow My glory upon Israel.

(Isaiah 47:1) 
Descend now, O virgin daughter of Babylon, and sit in the dust. Sit on the ground, for there is no longer a throne for you, O only daughter of the Chaldeans. You will never again be called delicate and tender.

(Isaiah 47:2) 
Take the millstone and grind flour (like a slave). Uncover your shame, bare your shoulder, bare your legs as you cross the rivers (because you will be exiled and treated as a slave).

(Isaiah 47:3) 
Your nakedness and disgrace will be revealed for all to see. I will take vengeance, and no one will be able to stop Me.

(Isaiah 47:4) 
For our Redeemer is the Lord of all armies, and His name is the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 47:5) 
Sit in silence, and go into the darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you will no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms (because your dominion is over).

(Isaiah 47:6) 
I was angry with My people, so I let My inheritance be defiled and gave them into your hand (so you could conquer them). But you showed them no mercy, and you greatly intensified your cruel oppression even upon the elderly.

(Isaiah 47:7) 
You said in your heart, 'I will be a sovereign queen forever!' You did not consider these things (your cruelty and the temporary nature of your power), nor did you ever think about what your ultimate end would be.

(Isaiah 47:8) 
Therefore, listen to these things, O luxurious one who sits so securely (in your false sense of safety). You say in your heart, 'I am the only power, and there is no one else like me! I will never be a widow (losing my king or power), nor will I ever experience the sorrow of barrenness (losing my people or prosperity).'

(Isaiah 47:9) 
But these two things will come upon you suddenly, in one single day: barrenness (the loss of your people) and widowhood (the loss of your king and power). All this bitter sorrow will come upon you because of the multitude of your evil sorceries, and because of the immense, powerful enchantments of your sorcerers (which will not save you).

(Isaiah 47:10) 
You had confidence in your wickedness, and you said, 'No one sees me' (meaning, no one can judge me). Your wisdom and your knowledge, which you boasted of, have utterly deceived you. And again, you said in your heart, 'I am the only power, and there is no one else like me!'

(Isaiah 47:11) 
Therefore, evil will come upon you, and you will not know its true origin or how to stop it. Calamity will rush upon you, which you will not be able to expiate or atone for. And misery will come upon you suddenly, which you will not know how to deal with.

(Isaiah 47:12) 
Now stand firm with your enchanters and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored (and placed your trust) from your youth. See if perhaps they can profit you, or if you can, through them, become stronger (against this coming doom).

(Isaiah 47:13) 
You are exhausted by the multitude of your (useless) counsels. Let your diviners of the heavens now stand up and save you—those who gazed at the stars and proclaimed monthly what would come upon you.

(Isaiah 47:14) 
Look, they have become like mere stubble for the fire (easily consumed and gone). They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. They will offer you no comfort like warming coals, nor be a fire to sit by for guidance.

(Isaiah 47:15) 
This is what will become of those for whom you have labored (your sorcerers, enchanters, and diviners). Your merchants, with whom you have traded since your youth, have all gone their own way (abandoning you in your time of need). There is no one left to save you.

(Isaiah 48:48:1) 
Listen to these words, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and have descended from the lineage of Judah. You swear oaths in the name of the Lord and recall the God of Israel, but you do not do so with sincerity or with justice.

(Isaiah 48:48:2) 
For indeed, you were called out from the holy city, Jerusalem. You claimed to rely on the God of Israel, whose name is the Lord of all creation.

(Isaiah 48:48:3) 
The first things I declared to you long ago; they came forth from My mouth and were heard. I suddenly brought them to pass, and they happened just as I said.

(Isaiah 48:48:4) 
I knew that you are stubborn, and your neck is like an iron sinew, making you stiff-necked and rebellious. Your forehead is like bronze, making you hard-headed and unyielding.

(Isaiah 48:48:5) 
I foretold these things to you from that very time. Before they happened, I revealed them to you so that you could not possibly say, 'My idols have done these things, and my carved images and my statues commanded them to happen.'

(Isaiah 48:48:6) 
You have heard it all; now see these things! I have announced everything to you. Will you not listen? From this moment on, I will make you hear new things, things hidden from you, which you have not yet known.

(Isaiah 48:48:7) 
These new things are created and revealed now, not from before this moment. You have not heard them, not yesterday, nor at any time previously, so that you cannot possibly say, 'Behold, I already knew these things.'

(Isaiah 48:48:8) 
You have heard and you have known, and your ear has supposedly been opened; but in truth, you have not truly listened. For I know that you have acted with treachery, and I have called you a transgressor from the moment of your birth.

(Isaiah 48:48:9) 
For the sake of My holy name, I will hold back My intense fury. For My own glory, I will restrain Myself and not let My wrath consume you, so that you do not utterly perish.

(Isaiah 48:48:10) 
Behold, I have refined you in fire, but not with the intention of purifying you perfectly like silver. Rather, I have chosen to refine you in the furnace of affliction and hardship.

(Isaiah 48:48:11) 
For My own sake, yes, for My very own sake, I will do these things so that My holy name may not be blasphemed. My glory I will not give to any other god or being.

(Isaiah 48:48:12) 
Listen to Me, O Jacob, and you, Israel, whom I have called into existence. I Myself am the one true God, I am the First, and I am the Last.

(Isaiah 48:48:13) 
My hand established the earth, and My right hand spread out the entire universe. When I call them, they all stand firm in their places.

(Isaiah 48:48:14) 
Gather together, all of you, and listen! Who among your false prophets or idols has announced these things beforehand? The Lord has chosen His servant, and that servant will accomplish His will against Babylon. His strong arm will come against the Chaldeans.

(Isaiah 48:48:15) 
I have spoken, and I Myself called him forth. I brought him to his task, and I have made his path successful.

(Isaiah 48:48:16) 
Come close to me and listen to these things: From the very beginning of time, I have not spoken in secret. From the moment it happened, I was there. And now, the Lord God has sent me on this mission, and His Spirit is with me.

(Isaiah 48:48:17) 
Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord your God, teaching you what is truly beneficial. I am guiding you along the precise path you should walk.

(Isaiah 48:48:18) 
Oh, if only you had paid attention to My commands! Then your peace would have flowed like a mighty river, and your righteousness would have been like the surging waves of the sea.

(Isaiah 48:48:19) 
Your offspring would then have been as numerous as the sand, and your descendants like its countless grains. Their name would never have been cut off or destroyed from before My presence.

(Isaiah 48:48:20) 
Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Proclaim with shouts of exultation, make this known, and spread it even to the farthest reaches of the earth! Declare: 'The Lord has ransomed His servant, the people of Israel!'

(Isaiah 48:48:21) 
They did not suffer thirst in the desert when He led them out. He made water flow for them from the rock; He split open the rock, and water gushed out for them to drink.

(Isaiah 48:48:22) 
The Lord God says: There is no true peace for the wicked.

(Isaiah 49:1) 
Listen, you distant peoples and remote lands! The Lord called me before I was born. From my mother's womb, He remembered my name and knew who I was.

(Isaiah 49:2) 
He made my words like a sharp sword. He protected me under the shadow of His hand, and made me like a chosen arrow, keeping me hidden in His quiver until the right time.

(Isaiah 49:3) 
And He told me, 'You are My Servant, Israel,' for through you, I will show forth My glory.

(Isaiah 49:4) 
But I had thought, 'I have toiled for nothing! I have spent my strength uselessly and in vain!' Yet, my vindication truly rests with the Lord, and my reward is with my God.

(Isaiah 49:5) 
Now the Lord speaks, He who formed me from the womb to be His Servant, so that I may bring Jacob back to Him. Even if Israel is not gathered to Him by me, still, I am honored in the sight of the Lord, and my God has become my strength.

(Isaiah 49:6) 
And He said: 'It is too small a thing for you to be My Servant only to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the remnant of Israel. Look, I have appointed you as a light to the nations, that you may be My salvation to the ends of the earth.'

(Isaiah 49:7) 
Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to the One despised in soul, to the nation abhorred, to the servant of rulers: 'Kings will see and rise, and princes will worship your Lord, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.'

(Isaiah 49:8) 
Thus says the Lord: 'At an acceptable time, I have heard you, and in the day of salvation, I have helped you. I have preserved you, and I have given you as a covenant to the people, so that you may restore the land and reclaim the desolate inheritances;'

(Isaiah 49:9) 
to say to those who are bound: 'Come forth!' and to those who are in darkness: 'Be revealed!' They will feed along the roads, and their pastures will be on all the bare heights.

(Isaiah 49:10) 
They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the scorching heat or the sun strike them, for their merciful One will lead them, and He will guide them to springs of water.

(Isaiah 49:11) 
And I will turn all My mountains into a clear path, and My highways will be raised up.

(Isaiah 49:12) 
Look, some will come from afar, and behold, others from the north and from the west, and still others from the southern land.

(Isaiah 49:13) 
Praise, O universe! Rejoice, O earth! Mountains, burst forth with praise! For the Lord has comforted His people, and He will have compassion on His afflicted ones.

(Isaiah 49:14) 
But Zion said, 'The Lord has abandoned me, and my Lord has forgotten me.'

(Isaiah 49:15) 
Can a woman forget her infant child, or fail to have compassion for the son she bore? Even if she could forget, I, your God, will never forget you.

(Isaiah 49:16) 
Look, I have inscribed your name on the palms of My hands—a sign of permanent remembrance and possession—and your walls are constantly before My eyes.

(Isaiah 49:17) 
Your builders are hurrying to rebuild you, while those who laid you waste and demolished you will quickly depart from you.

(Isaiah 49:18) 
Lift up your eyes all around, and see! All these who come are gathering to you. 'As I live,' declares the Lord, 'for you will dress yourself with all of them as with an ornament, and you will array yourself with them like a bride,' a metaphor for the Church adorned with its new members.

(Isaiah 49:19) 
For your desolate and ruined land will now be too narrow for its inhabitants. And those who devoured you will be driven far away.

(Isaiah 49:20) 
The children born to you during your desolation will still say in your hearing: 'The place is too confined for me; make room for me to dwell!'

(Isaiah 49:21) 
Then you will say in your heart: 'Who has given birth to all these for me? I was barren and childless, an exile and a captive; so who raised all these? I was forsaken and alone; where then did these come from?'

(Isaiah 49:22) 
Thus says the Lord God: 'Look, I will lift up My hand to the nations and raise My banner to the peoples, and they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders.'

(Isaiah 49:23) 
And kings will be your guardians and queens your nurses. They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground and lick the dust from your feet. Then you will know that I am the Lord; and those who wait for Me will not be put to shame.

(Isaiah 49:24) 
Can plunder be taken from a mighty warrior? Or can a captive be rescued from a powerful tyrant?

(Isaiah 49:25) 
For thus says the Lord: 'Indeed, even the mighty will be taken captive, and what was seized by the strong will be rescued. And those who have judged you, I Myself will judge; and your children, I Myself will save.'

(Isaiah 49:26) 
I will make your enemies eat their own flesh—a metaphor for self-destruction and divine retribution—and they will be drunk with their own blood as with new wine. Then all flesh will know that I am the Lord, your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

(Isaiah 50:1) 
The Lord God says this: "Where is the divorce decree for your mother – the one with which I supposedly dismissed her? Or which of My creditors can you name, to whom I supposedly sold you as payment? Look, it was because of your own sins and wicked deeds that you were sold into captivity, and it was because of your crimes that your mother – the nation of Israel – was divorced from the covenant."

(Isaiah 50:2) 
"Why is it that when I came to you, there was no one present to hear Me? When I called out, there was no one to answer Me. Has My arm of power become so short and weak that I cannot redeem you? Do I lack the strength to deliver you? Watch how, with a single rebuke from Me, I can turn the sea into a desert, and make the rivers run dry. The fish in them will rot away without water, and they will die of thirst."

(Isaiah 50:3) 
I can even clothe the sky itself with darkness, making sackcloth its covering, like a symbol of mourning.

(Isaiah 50:4) 
The Lord God has given Me a trained tongue, so that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word of encouragement and truth. Every morning, He awakens My ear, training Me to listen as a disciple is taught.

(Isaiah 50:5) 
The Lord God has opened My ear to listen, and I have not rebelled against His will; I have not turned away from Him.

(Isaiah 50:6) 
I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. I did not hide My face from insult and from those who spat upon Me.

(Isaiah 50:7) 
The Lord God is My helper, therefore I have not been disgraced. Therefore, I have set My face like a very hard rock, knowing that I will not be put to shame.

(Isaiah 50:8) 
He who justifies Me is near. Who would dare to dispute My claim? Let us stand together and face each other! Who is My adversary? Let him come near to Me!

(Isaiah 50:9) 
Look, the Lord God is My helper! So then, who is the one who will condemn Me? Behold, all of these accusers will wear out like a garment; a moth will consume them.

(Isaiah 50:10) 
Who among you fears the Lord and listens to the voice of His Servant? For he who walks in deep darkness, with no light to guide him, let him put his hope in the Name of the Lord and lean on his God for support.

(Isaiah 50:11) 
But look, all of you who kindle your own fire, who gird yourselves with your own flames of self-reliance, go ahead and walk in the light of your own fire and in the flames you yourselves have kindled! This judgment comes from My hand upon you; you will lie down in sorrow and pain.

(Isaiah 51:1) 
Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord. Look back at the rock from which you were carved—the very quarry from which you were dug.

(Isaiah 51:2) 
Look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave birth to you. Remember, I called him when he was alone; then I blessed him, and I made him into a multitude.

(Isaiah 51:3) 
Therefore, the Lord will bring comfort to Zion. He will comfort all her desolate places and turn her desert into a garden of delights, like the very Garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found there, with heartfelt thanksgiving and the sound of praise.

(Isaiah 51:4) 
Pay attention to me, My people. Listen closely, My nation. For My Law will go forth from Me, and My justice will rest upon the nations as a light for all to see.

(Isaiah 51:5) 
My righteousness is near, My salvation has already gone out. My mighty arm will judge all the peoples. The distant nations are waiting for Me, and they will rely on My mighty arm.

(Isaiah 51:6) 
Lift up your eyes to the physical universe, and then look down upon the earth. For the very heavens will vanish like smoke, and the earth will wear out like a garment. All its inhabitants will perish just like these things. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will never fail.

(Isaiah 51:7) 
Listen to Me, you who know what is right—you, the people of My heart, in whose mouth My Law resides. Do not be afraid of human scorn, and do not fear their blasphemies against you.

(Isaiah 51:8) 
For a worm will consume them just as it consumes a garment. A moth will devour them just as it devours wool. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will endure for all generations.

(Isaiah 51:9) 
Awaken, awaken! Clothe yourself with strength, O mighty arm of the Lord! Awaken as in the ancient days, as in generations long past. Was it not you who struck down Rahab—the proud one—and wounded the dragon? —This refers to God's defeat of Egypt and its pharaoh.

(Isaiah 51:10) 
Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the mighty deep? Was it not you who made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass through?

(Isaiah 51:11) 
And now, those redeemed by the Lord will return. They will come to Zion with songs of praise. Everlasting joy will crown their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and all sorrow and groaning will flee away.

(Isaiah 51:12) 
I myself am your Comforter. Who are you to fear a mortal man? Why are you afraid of a mere son of man who withers like grass?

(Isaiah 51:13) 
Yet you have forgotten the Lord, your Maker, who stretched out the universe and laid the foundations of the earth. You have lived in constant fear all day long because of the fury of the oppressor who was ready to destroy. But where is the fury of that oppressor now?

(Isaiah 51:14) 
The captive will soon be set free, walking out of his bonds. He will not die in the pit, nor will his food fail him.

(Isaiah 51:15) 
For I am the Lord your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar. The Lord of hosts is My Name.

(Isaiah 51:16) 
I have put My words in your mouth, and in the shadow of My hand I have protected you. This is so that you may establish a new order for My people, just as if you were planting the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth. And to Zion, you will declare: 'You are My people!'

(Isaiah 51:17) 
Awaken, awaken, awaken, O Jerusalem! You have drunk from the Lord’s hand the cup of His wrath, draining it to the very dregs. You have consumed and emptied the cup of staggering.

(Isaiah 51:18) 
Among all the sons she bore, there is no one to support her. Among all the sons she nourished, there is no one to take her by the hand.

(Isaiah 51:19) 
These two calamities have befallen you—who then will mourn for you? It is desolation and destruction, famine and the sword. Who will comfort you now?

(Isaiah 51:20) 
Your sons lie helpless, cast away at the head of every street, like a stag caught in a net. They are filled with the Lord’s indignation, overwhelmed by the rebuke of your God.

(Isaiah 51:21) 
Therefore, hear this, you afflicted one, you who are drunk, but not with wine.

(Isaiah 51:22) 
Thus says your Sovereign Lord, your God, who fights for His people: 'Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering, the chalice of My indignation. You will never drink from it again.'

(Isaiah 51:23) 
And I will place that cup into the hand of those who humiliated you and who afflicted you. For you said to your soul: 'Bow down, so that we may pass over.' And you made your body like the ground itself, and like a street for those who walked over you.

(Isaiah 52:1) 
Arise, arise! Put on your strength, O Zion. Put on your glorious garments, Jerusalem, O city of the Holy One of Israel. For no one uncircumcised or unclean will ever again pass through your gates.

(Isaiah 52:2) 
Shake yourself free from the dust, stand up, and be seated in honor, Jerusalem. Release the chains from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

(Isaiah 52:3) 
For this is what the Lord says: You were sold into slavery for no price at all, and you will be redeemed without any payment.

(Isaiah 52:4) 
For this is what the Lord God says: My people went down into Egypt in the beginning to live there as temporary residents. And then, without any just cause, Assyria oppressed them.

(Isaiah 52:5) 
And now, what is left for Me here? says the Lord. For My people have been taken captive for no reason. Their rulers act unjustly, says the Lord, and My holy name is constantly blasphemed all day long because of this injustice.

(Isaiah 52:6) 
Therefore, My people will truly know My name on that day. They will understand that I, the very one who has been speaking to them, am now truly present to act.

(Isaiah 52:7) 
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces and proclaims peace, who announces what is truly good, who proclaims salvation, and who says to Zion: 'Your God reigns as King!'

(Isaiah 52:8) 
Listen! The voice of your watchmen! They have lifted up their voices in joyful song; together they will praise the Lord! For they will see eye to eye, with perfect clarity and shared understanding, when the Lord restores Zion and brings His people home.

(Isaiah 52:9) 
Break forth into joyful shouts and sing praises together, O desolate Jerusalem! For the Lord has already comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem, a certainty for the future.

(Isaiah 52:10) 
The Lord has revealed His holy arm, His mighty power to act, in the sight of all the Gentile nations. And all the ends of the earth will see the salvation that comes from our God.

(Isaiah 52:11) 
Depart, depart! Go out from there, from Babylon! Do not touch anything unclean. Go out from her midst; purify yourselves, you who carry the sacred vessels of the Lord intended for His temple.

(Isaiah 52:12) 
For you will not go out in panicked confusion, nor will you flee in haste like the Exodus from Egypt. For the Lord Himself will go before you, leading the way, and the God of Israel will gather you, protecting your rear.

(Isaiah 52:13) 
Behold, My servant will act with great wisdom and insight, fulfilling God's plan. He will be exalted and lifted up, and He will be exceedingly high in glory, speaking of His future resurrection and ascension.

(Isaiah 52:14) 
Just as many people were utterly astonished at His appearance, so disfigured was His form, beyond that of any man, and His appearance among the sons of men was beyond recognition due to suffering.

(Isaiah 52:15) 
This Servant will sprinkle many nations, performing a priestly purification and cleansing them. Kings will be utterly silent in His presence, standing in awe, for what had never been told to them they will now see, and what they had never heard they will now deeply contemplate regarding God's mysterious plan.

(Isaiah 53:1) 
Who has truly believed the message we have delivered? And to whom has the powerful, saving strength of God been revealed?

(Isaiah 53:2) 
He grew up before God, humble and unassuming, like a new shoot or a root from dry ground. He had no striking appearance, no outward splendor that would attract us. When we looked at Him, there was nothing in His visible form that would make us desire Him.

(Isaiah 53:3) 
He was despised and considered the lowest of men. He was a Man intimately acquainted with sorrows and suffering. His face was as if hidden from us by His suffering, or as if we turned our faces from Him in contempt. Indeed, He was so despised that we did not consider Him worthy of any regard.

(Isaiah 53:4) 
But in truth, He Himself carried our weaknesses and sicknesses, and He Himself bore the burden of our sorrows. Yet we thought of Him as if He were a leper, struck by God's judgment and humiliated.

(Isaiah 53:5) 
But He Himself was truly wounded because of our own rebellious sins. He was crushed and broken because of our wicked deeds. The severe punishment that brought about our peace with God was laid upon Him. And by the bruised marks of His scourging, we are spiritually healed.

(Isaiah 53:6) 
All of us, like wayward sheep, have gone astray. Each one of us has turned aside onto his own sinful path. And the Lord God placed upon Him the collective guilt and sin of all of us.

(Isaiah 53:7) 
He willingly allowed Himself to be offered as a sacrifice, and He did not open His mouth to defend Himself. He was led like a sacrificial sheep to the slaughter. And like a lamb that remains silent before its shearer, so He remained silent, truly not opening His mouth during His trial and suffering.

(Isaiah 53:8) 
He was taken away from oppression and from a biased judgment. And who can truly recount the story of His unique life or His spiritual descendants, seeing that His earthly life was cut short and He was cut off from the land of the living? For it was because of the rebellious sins of My people that I, God the Father, allowed Him to be struck down in death.

(Isaiah 53:9) 
He was indeed appointed a grave with the wicked, but in His death, His actual burial was with the rich. This was so because He had committed no sin, nor was there any deceit found in His words or actions.

(Isaiah 53:10) 
Yet it was the Lord God's divine will to crush Him with profound suffering. He laid down His very life as a perfect sin offering. Because He offered His life as a sin offering, He will see His spiritual offspring, the Church, live eternally. And through His work, the will and divine plan of the Lord will be perfectly accomplished.

(Isaiah 53:11) 
Because of the immense suffering and anguish of His soul, He will see the glorious result of His sacrifice and be completely satisfied. Through His perfect knowledge and the divine wisdom He embodies, My righteous Servant, Jesus Christ, will make many people righteous, and He Himself will carry the burden of their accumulated sins.

(Isaiah 53:12) 
Therefore, I will grant Him a place of supreme honor among the great, and He will distribute the spoils of His victory with the triumphant mighty ones. This ultimate reward is because He willingly surrendered His life unto death, and was counted among common criminals. He Himself bore the full weight of the sins of many, and He interceded in prayer on behalf of all transgressors.

(Isaiah 54:1) 
Rejoice, O barren one who has not given birth! Sing praise and shout for joy, you who have not known the pains of childbirth! For the Lord God says: the children of the deserted woman will be more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband.

(Isaiah 54:2) 
Enlarge the place of your tent. Stretch out the curtains of your dwelling places, do not hold back! Lengthen your ropes, and strengthen your tent stakes.

(Isaiah 54:3) 
For you shall spread out to the right and to the left, and your descendants will inherit the nations, and they will inhabit the cities that were once deserted.

(Isaiah 54:4) 
Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame. Do not be disgraced, for you will not suffer reproach. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.

(Isaiah 54:5) 
For the Lord God, acting as a husband, abandoned you for a time. But then, with a spirit of compassion and sadness, He called you back to be His wife, the wife of His youth. Your Husband says this, and His name is the Lord of Armies. And your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, He shall be called the God of all the earth.

(Isaiah 54:6) 
For a brief, fleeting moment, I abandoned you. But with great acts of mercy, I will gather you back to Myself.

(Isaiah 54:7) 
In a moment of My judgment, I hid My face from you for a short time. But with an everlasting act of mercy, I have had compassion on you, says the Lord God, your Redeemer.

(Isaiah 54:8) 
This covenant of My faithfulness is for Me like the waters of Noah, concerning which I swore that they should never again flood the earth. So now I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, and I will not rebuke you.

(Isaiah 54:9) 
For even if the mountains are removed and the hills tremble and shake, My mercy shall not depart from you. And My covenant of peace will not be shaken, says the Lord God who shows you mercy.

(Isaiah 54:10) 
O poor little one, tossed and battered by a storm, without any earthly comfort: behold, I Myself will lay your foundation stones in their proper order, and I will lay your foundations with sapphires.

(Isaiah 54:11) 
And I will make your battlements of jasper, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of beautiful, precious stones.

(Isaiah 54:12) 
All your children shall be taught directly by the Lord God Himself, and the peace of your children will be abundant.

(Isaiah 54:13) 
And you shall be established in true justice. Stay far from all false accusation and slander, for you will have no reason to fear. And keep away from terror, for it will not come near you.

(Isaiah 54:14) 
Behold, those who gathered against you did so, but not by My counsel. Therefore, whoever gathers against you will surely fall because of you.

(Isaiah 54:15) 
Behold, I Myself created the craftsman who blows the coals in the fire and brings forth a weapon to perform his work. And I Myself created the destroyer to bring about ruin.

(Isaiah 54:16) 
No weapon that is forged against you will succeed. And you shall condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the promised inheritance of the servants of the Lord God, and their righteousness comes directly from Me, says the Lord God.

(Isaiah 55:1) 
All of you who are thirsty, come to the living waters! And you who have no money, hurry, come and buy food and drink. Come and buy wine and milk without any money or cost.

(Isaiah 55:2) 
Why do you spend your money on food that does not truly nourish you, and your labor on things that never genuinely satisfy? Listen to Me, and you will eat what is truly good. Your soul will find delight and richness in true abundance.

(Isaiah 55:3) 
Turn your ear toward Me and come to Me. Listen, and your soul will live. And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, according to the faithful mercies promised to David, which are now fulfilled in the Messiah.

(Isaiah 55:4) 
Indeed, I have given Him (the Messiah) as a witness to all peoples, a leader and a teacher for all the nations.

(Isaiah 55:5) 
Behold, you, O Messiah, will call a nation that does not know you. And nations that did not recognize you will run to you because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has brought you glory.

(Isaiah 55:6) 
Seek the Lord while He may be found. Call upon Him while He is near.

(Isaiah 55:7) 
Let the wicked abandon his sinful path, and the unrighteous man his evil thoughts. Let him return to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him, and to our God, for He is rich in forgiving.

(Isaiah 55:8) 
For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 55:9) 
For as the expanse of the sky is higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts.

(Isaiah 55:10) 
For just as the rain and snow come down from the sky and do not return there, but rather thoroughly water the earth, making it fertile and causing it to sprout, providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater—

(Isaiah 55:11) 
So also will be My Divine Word that comes forth from My mouth. It will not return to Me unfulfilled, but it will accomplish all that I desire, and it will prosper in every mission for which I have sent it.

(Isaiah 55:12) 
Indeed, you will go out with joy, and you will be led forth in peace. The mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their branches in joy.

(Isaiah 55:13) 
Instead of the thorny briar, the fragrant fir tree will grow. And in place of the stinging nettle, the beautiful myrtle tree will flourish. This will bring honor and renown to the Lord, an everlasting sign that will never be removed.

(Isaiah 56:1) 
The Lord God says this: "Guard the divine law and live righteously, because my saving grace is coming soon, and my righteousness is about to be revealed."

(Isaiah 56:2) 
Blessed is the man who does these things, and blessed is the human who keeps hold of these truths. This person keeps the Sabbath holy and does not profane it. This person keeps their hands from doing any evil.

(Isaiah 56:3) 
Let no foreign person who has joined himself to the Lord say, "The Lord has surely separated me from His people." And let no eunuch say, "Behold, I am like a barren tree that cannot bear fruit."

(Isaiah 56:4) 
For the Lord God says this to the eunuchs: "Whoever keeps my Sabbaths, and chooses what pleases me, and holds fast to my covenant with Him..."

(Isaiah 56:5) 
...I will give them a place in my holy house, within my sacred walls, and a name that is better than having sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will never perish."

(Isaiah 56:6) 
And the foreign people who have joined themselves to the Lord to worship Him and to love His name, to be His servants — all of them who keep the Sabbath without profaning it and who hold fast to my covenant —

(Isaiah 56:7) 
— I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be pleasing to me upon my altar, because my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples."

(Isaiah 56:8) 
The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed children of Israel, says this: "I will gather still more people to them, beyond those who are already gathered."

(Isaiah 56:9) 
"All you wild beasts of the open field, come to devour! All you wild beasts of the forest, come!"

(Isaiah 56:10) 
"All of their watchmen are blind; they know nothing at all. They are like mute dogs, unable to bark a warning. They see useless visions, they are always sleeping, and they love to dream."

(Isaiah 56:11) 
"They are like greedy dogs that can never be satisfied. These very shepherds have no understanding. Every one of them has turned aside to their own way, each one consumed by their own greed, from the highest leader to the lowest."

(Isaiah 56:12) 
"They say: 'Come, let us get wine and fill ourselves with drunkenness! And it will be just as it is today, so shall it be tomorrow, and even more abundantly so!'"

(Isaiah 57:1) 
The righteous person dies, and no one takes it to heart. Merciful men are taken away, because no one understands why this is happening. For the righteous person is taken away from the presence of evil.

(Isaiah 57:2) 
Let them come to a peaceful rest. Those who lived righteously will rest in their dwelling place.

(Isaiah 57:3) 
But you, come here, you children of sorcery and wickedness, you offspring of adulterers and harlots.

(Isaiah 57:4) 
At whom do you make sport? Against whom do you widen your mouth and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of rebellion, a deceitful offspring?

(Isaiah 57:5) 
You who burn with lust for idols under every leafy tree, sacrificing children in the valleys, under the high rocks.

(Isaiah 57:6) 
Among the smooth stones, that is your chosen portion; this is your destiny. And to them you poured out drink offerings and offered sacrifices. Will I not be indignant over these things?

(Isaiah 57:7) 
Upon a high and lofty mountain you set up your idolatrous altar, and there you ascended to offer sacrifices to idols.

(Isaiah 57:8) 
And behind the door and behind the doorpost you have placed your pagan symbols. For far from Me, you exposed yourselves and ascended to these high places. You widened your place for such acts and made a covenant with them. You loved their idolatrous rituals, giving yourselves completely to them.

(Isaiah 57:9) 
And you adorned yourself for the foreign king with perfume and oil, and you used many pigments. You sent your envoys far away, and you debased yourself, descending to the very depths of the underworld.

(Isaiah 57:10) 
You wearied yourself with your many, sinful ways, yet you did not say: "I will stop." You found renewed strength in your own efforts; therefore you did not utterly faint.

(Isaiah 57:11) 
For whom were you anxious, and whom did you fear, since you were false and did not remember Me, nor did you consider Me in your heart? Because of this, I also was silent, as if I saw nothing. And you committed evil, yet you thought you had nothing to fear from Me.

(Isaiah 57:12) 
I will expose your supposed righteousness, and your deeds will not bring you any benefit.

(Isaiah 57:13) 
When you cry out, let the idols you have gathered deliver you. A mere breath of wind will carry all of them away, sweeping them off completely. However, he who trusts in Me will inherit the land and will possess My holy mountain (meaning, the true Temple of God).

(Isaiah 57:14) 
And I will say: "Level the road, level it, make the path clear, remove all obstacles from the path of My people."

(Isaiah 57:15) 
For thus says the Exalted and Sublime One, who inhabits eternity, and whose name is Holy: "I, the Holy One, dwell with the contrite and humble in spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite."

(Isaiah 57:16) 
For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry. This is because the human spirit comes forth from My presence, and it is I who give all life and breath.

(Isaiah 57:17) 
Because of the iniquity of his greed, I became angry and struck him. I hid My face from you, and I was intensely angry. And he continued to wander in the way of his own stubborn heart.

(Isaiah 57:18) 
I have seen their ways (of wandering), and I healed them, and I led them back to Me. And I restored comfort to them and to those who mourned for them.

(Isaiah 57:19) 
I create the fruit of the lips—peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near (meaning both Gentiles and Jews, or those far in sin and those struggling nearby), says the Lord, and I heal him.

(Isaiah 57:20) 
But the wicked are like a restless, churning sea that cannot be still, and its waves keep tossing up mire and filth.

(Isaiah 57:21) 
"There is no peace for the wicked," says the Lord God.

(Isaiah 58:1) 
Cry out, do not be silent! Raise your voice like a trumpet, and announce to My people their serious crimes, and to the household of Jacob—the entire nation of Israel—their sins.

(Isaiah 58:2) 
Indeed, they seek Me day after day, and they claim to want to know My ways, acting as if they were a nation that truly practiced justice and and never abandoned the divine judgment of their God. They ask Me for just decisions and claim to want to draw near to God.

(Isaiah 58:3) 
They ask: “Why have we fasted, and You have not noticed? We humble ourselves, and You do not acknowledge it?” But behold, on the very day of your supposed fast, you seek only your own selfish desires, and you exact payment from all your debtors.

(Isaiah 58:4) 
Look! You fast only to engage in strife and quarrels, and you strike others with wicked fists. Do not fast as you have done up to this very day if you expect your cries to be heard on high by God.

(Isaiah 58:5) 
Is this the kind of fast that I, the Lord, have chosen? Is it merely for a person to afflict their body for one day? Is it to bow their head like a drooping reed and spread sackcloth and ashes beneath them? Would you call this a true fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?

(Isaiah 58:6) 
Is not this, rather, the genuine fast that I have chosen: to loosen the bonds that tie people to wickedness, to untie the heavy loads of oppression, to let those who are crushed go free, and to break every oppressive yoke?

(Isaiah 58:7) 
It is to share your bread with the hungry, and to bring the poor and homeless into your own house. When you see someone naked, it is to clothe them; and you must not turn away from your own kin, ignoring their needs.

(Isaiah 58:8) 
Then your light will burst forth like the morning dawn, and your healing will quickly spring up. Your righteousness will go before you, guiding your path, and the glory of the Lord will gather and protect you.

(Isaiah 58:9) 
Then you will call upon the Lord, and He will answer; you will cry out, and He will say: “Here I am!” This will happen if you remove the yoke of oppression from your midst, and stop speaking worthless words, and cease pointing the finger of scorn or accusation, and speaking lies.

(Isaiah 58:10) 
If you truly pour out your soul to the hungry, extending your whole self to them, and satisfy the needs of the afflicted soul, then your light will rise even in the midst of darkness, and your deep gloom will become as bright as the noonday sun.

(Isaiah 58:11) 
And the Lord will give you constant rest and peace forever. He will fill your soul with splendid blessings and invigorate your whole being, strengthening your very bones. You will be like a well-watered garden, and like a spring of water whose life-giving waters never run dry.

(Isaiah 58:12) 
And people will rebuild the long-desolate places through you. You will raise up the foundations that can last for many generations. You will be called “the repairer of the broken walls” and “the restorer of the ancient paths to dwell in.”

(Isaiah 58:13) 
If you turn your foot away from trampling the Sabbath—that is, from doing your own selfish will on My holy day—and if you call the Sabbath a true delight, and the Lord’s holy day glorious, and you truly honor it by not pursuing your own personal ways, and your own will is not found in idle talk or personal business, then these blessings will be yours.

(Isaiah 58:14) 
Then you will find your true delight in the Lord. I will lift you up above all the high places of the earth and feed you with the rich inheritance of Jacob your father. For the mouth of the Lord Himself has spoken these promises.

(Isaiah 59:1) 
Look now, the power of the Lord is not too short or weak that He cannot save; nor is His ear too heavy or deaf to hear the prayers of His people.

(Isaiah 59:2) 
But your moral failures have created a division between you and your God. Your sinful actions have hidden His presence from you, preventing Him from hearing your prayers.

(Isaiah 59:3) 
For your hands are stained with the guilt of bloodshed, and your fingers are defiled by wickedness. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue has uttered malicious falsehoods.

(Isaiah 59:4) 
There is no one who calls for justice, nor anyone who judges with truthfulness. Instead, they put their trust in emptiness, and they speak what is false and useless. They conceive evil schemes, and they bring forth wickedness.

(Isaiah 59:5) 
They hatch the eggs of poisonous serpents, and they weave the webs of spiders. Whoever eats of their eggs will die from the venom, and what they carefully nourish will burst forth as a viper.

(Isaiah 59:6) 
Their spider-like webs of schemes will not serve as clothing for anyone, nor will they be covered by the results of their own actions. For their works are works of injustice, and their hands perform wicked deeds.

(Isaiah 59:7) 
Their feet run quickly towards evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are worthless and destructive thoughts. Ruin and destruction mark their paths.

(Isaiah 59:8) 
They have not known the way of peace, and there is no true justice in their footsteps—meaning their actions and decisions. Their paths are twisted and crooked for them; everyone who walks on such paths will not know peace.

(Isaiah 59:9) 
Because of this, divine justice has moved far away from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hoped for light, but behold, there is only darkness; we looked for brightness, but we walk in thick gloom.

(Isaiah 59:10) 
Like blind people, we grope along a wall, and like those without eyes, we stumble forward. We trip at midday as if it were dark, and in places of abundance, we are like the dead.

(Isaiah 59:11) 
We all roar like bears in distress, and we moan mournfully like doves. We have waited for divine judgment to set things right, but it has not come; we have hoped for salvation, but it remains far from us.

(Isaiah 59:12) 
For our moral failures have multiplied before You, O God, and our sins themselves bear witness against us. Indeed, our wicked deeds are with us always, and we have recognized our own unrighteousness.

(Isaiah 59:13) 
We have been false and lied to the Lord, and we have turned away from following the steps of our God. We have spoken slander and defamation, conceiving and uttering from our hearts words of deceit.

(Isaiah 59:14) 
And true justice has been turned back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has fallen in the public square, and equity has been unable to enter there.

(Isaiah 59:15) 
And truth has been forgotten, and he who turns away from evil becomes prey. And the Lord saw this, and it displeased Him that there was no justice being rendered.

(Isaiah 59:16) 
And He saw that there was no man to intervene—no one to act righteously. He was astonished that there was no one to intercede. So His own mighty power brought salvation for His people, and His righteousness itself sustained them.

(Isaiah 59:17) 
He clothed Himself with righteousness as a breastplate, and put a helmet of salvation upon His head. He dressed Himself with garments of vengeance, and was covered with zeal like a cloak.

(Isaiah 59:18) 
He will come for vengeance, for a just repayment of His indignation against His enemies, and He will render recompense to His adversaries. He will pay back the distant lands according to their deeds.

(Isaiah 59:19) 
And those from the west will fear the Name of the Lord, and those from the rising of the sun will fear His glory, when He comes like a rushing river driven by the very Spirit of the Lord.

(Isaiah 59:20) 
And the Redeemer will come to Mount Zion, and to those in the house of Jacob who turn away from their moral failures, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 59:21) 
"This is My covenant with them," says the Lord: "My Spirit who rests in you, and My words which I have placed in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your children's children," says the Lord, "from this present time and even unto eternity."

(Isaiah 60:1) 
Arise, Jerusalem, and shine forth, for your light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you.

(Isaiah 60:2) 
Behold, thick darkness will cover the earth, and deep gloom will encompass the peoples. But the Lord will rise upon you, and His glory will be visible in you.

(Isaiah 60:3) 
And nations will walk by means of your light, and kings by the brightness of your rising.

(Isaiah 60:4) 
Lift up your eyes all around you and see: all these people have gathered and come to you. Your sons will come from far away, and your daughters will be carried at your side (tenderly, as one carries a beloved child).

(Isaiah 60:5) 
Then you will see this, and you will overflow with joy. Your heart will be amazed and greatly expanded, when the abundance of the sea and the wealth of the nations is turned towards you and comes to you.

(Isaiah 60:6) 
Vast numbers of camels will cover your land, dromedaries from Midian and Ephah. All of them will come from Sheba, bringing gold and frankincense, and proclaiming the praise due to the Lord.

(Isaiah 60:7) 
All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered for your sake; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you. They will be offered upon My altar, which makes propitiation, and I will glorify the house of My majesty.

(Isaiah 60:8) 
Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves returning swiftly to their dovecotes?

(Isaiah 60:9) 
For the distant lands await Me, and the ships of the sea are prepared (ready to sail), so that I may bring your sons from afar, bringing their silver and their gold with them, to the Name of the Lord your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.

(Isaiah 60:10) 
And the sons of foreigners will build your walls, and their kings will serve you. For in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor and mercy, I have had compassion on you.

(Isaiah 60:11) 
And your gates will be opened continuously, day and night, so that the wealth of the nations may be brought to you, and their kings may be led in.

(Isaiah 60:12) 
For any nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish; indeed, those nations will be utterly laid waste and left desolate.

(Isaiah 60:13) 
The glory of Lebanon will come to you—the fir, the boxwood, and the pine together—to adorn the place of My sanctuary. And I will glorify the place where My feet rest (the Temple or My holy habitation).

(Isaiah 60:14) 
And the sons of those who humbled you will come bowed down to you. All who scorned you will prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet. And they will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

(Isaiah 60:15) 
In place of your former state, when you were forsaken and hated, and no one would even pass through you, I will make you an eternal glory, a joy for every generation.

(Isaiah 60:16) 
You will draw sustenance from the nations and be nourished by kings. And you will know that I am the Lord, your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

(Isaiah 60:17) 
Instead of bronze, I will bring you gold; and instead of iron, I will bring you silver; and instead of wood, bronze; and instead of stones, iron. I will make your governance to be peace, and your taskmasters to be justice.

(Isaiah 60:18) 
Violence will no longer be heard in your land, nor devastation or destruction within your borders. Salvation will occupy your walls, and praise will guard your gates.

(Isaiah 60:19) 
The sun will no longer be your light during the day, nor will the brilliance of the moon illuminate you. Instead, the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.

(Isaiah 60:20) 
Your sun will never set again, and your moon will no longer wane, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will come to an end.

(Isaiah 60:21) 
Then all your people will be righteous; they will inherit the land forever. They are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, intended for My glory.

(Isaiah 60:22) 
The smallest among you will become a thousand, and the least will become a mighty nation. I, the Lord, will accomplish this swiftly in its appointed time.

(Isaiah 61:1) 
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me for a specific mission. He has sent me to preach good news to those who are humble and teachable, to heal those whose hearts are broken by sorrow, to announce freedom to those who are held captive, and to declare release to those who are imprisoned.

(Isaiah 61:2) 
He has sent me to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor—a time of grace and salvation—and to declare the day of our God’s justice, when He will bring judgment against His enemies. My mission is also to comfort all who mourn.

(Isaiah 61:3) 
I am sent to bring comfort to the mourners in Zion, and to give them a crown instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness and despair. They will then be called mighty oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for His own glory.

(Isaiah 61:4) 
They will rebuild the ancient ruins that have been desolate for ages. They will restore the cities that were laid waste and scattered throughout many generations.

(Isaiah 61:5) 
And foreigners will stand ready to tend your flocks. The children of strangers will be your farmers and your vinedressers, helping you with your labor.

(Isaiah 61:6) 
But you, the redeemed people, will be called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of our God, serving Him in His holy temple. You will feed on the strength and wealth of the nations, and you will glory in their splendor.

(Isaiah 61:7) 
Instead of the double shame and disgrace you have endured, your people will praise their portion. Because of this, they will possess double in their own land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.

(Isaiah 61:8) 
For I, the Lord, love justice and hate robbery and injustice, even when offered as a burnt offering to me. Therefore, I will truly give them their reward, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

(Isaiah 61:9) 
Their offspring will be known among the nations, and their descendants among the peoples. All who see them will recognize them, that they are the offspring whom the Lord has blessed.

(Isaiah 61:10) 
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul will exult and triumph in my God, for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in the robe of righteousness. He has adorned me like a bridegroom with a garland, and like a bride bedecked with her jewels.

(Isaiah 61:11) 
For just as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and just as a garden causes its seeds to grow, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

(Isaiah 62:1) 
For the sake of the City of God, I will not be silent. For the sake of the people of Jerusalem, I will not rest, until her righteousness shines forth like brilliant light, and her salvation burns brightly like a lamp.

(Isaiah 62:2) 
Then the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings will behold your glory. You will be called by a new name, a name that the mouth of the Lord Himself will declare.

(Isaiah 62:3) 
You will be a crown of splendor in the hand of the Lord, a royal diadem in the right hand of your God.

(Isaiah 62:4) 
You will no longer be called 'Forsaken', and your land will no longer be called 'Desolate'. Instead, you will be called 'My Delight is in Her' (which means God takes pleasure in you), and your land 'Inhabited'. For the Lord Himself takes delight in you, and your land will be settled with people.

(Isaiah 62:5) 
For just as a young man settles down with a virgin, so your sons will settle and live within you. And just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.

(Isaiah 62:6) 
Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have placed watchmen. All day and all night, they will never be silent. You who bring the Lord to remembrance, never be silent.

(Isaiah 62:7) 
And do not give Him any rest, until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her a city praised throughout the earth.

(Isaiah 62:8) 
The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: 'I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies. Foreigners will no longer drink the wine for which you have toiled.'

(Isaiah 62:9) 
Instead, those who harvest the grain will eat it and praise the Lord. And those who gather the wine will drink it in the courtyards of My holy sanctuary.

(Isaiah 62:10) 
Go out, go out through the gates! Prepare the way for the people! Make the highway level, clear away the stones! Raise a banner for all the nations!

(Isaiah 62:11) 
Behold, the Lord has made a proclamation to the furthest ends of the earth! Say to the Daughter of Zion: 'Behold, your Savior comes! His reward is with Him, and His just recompense is before Him.'

(Isaiah 62:12) 
And they will be called 'The Holy People', 'The Redeemed of the Lord'. And you, O Jerusalem, will be called 'Sought Out' and 'A City Never Forsaken'.

(Isaiah 63:1) 
Who is this one coming from the land of Edom, his garments stained crimson from the city of Bozrah? Who is this one, so glorious in his robe, marching forth in the fullness of his power? He answers, “I am the one who proclaims righteousness, and I am a mighty defender to save.”

(Isaiah 63:2) 
So why then are your garments red, and your robes like those of someone treading grapes in a winepress?

(Isaiah 63:3) 
I alone have trodden the winepress, and of all the nations, there was no one with me to help. I trampled them down in my burning fury, and I crushed them in my hot wrath. Their lifeblood splattered upon my garments, and I have stained all my clothing with it.

(Isaiah 63:4) 
For the day of vengeance was determined in my heart, and the year for my people’s deliverance and retribution upon their enemies has now come.

(Isaiah 63:5) 
I looked all around, but there was no helper; I sought, but there was no one to assist. So my own mighty arm brought me victory, and my fierce indignation sustained me and gave me strength.

(Isaiah 63:6) 
And I trampled down entire nations in my fury, and I overwhelmed them with my indignation as if they were drunk. And I brought their power crashing down to the earth.

(Isaiah 63:7) 
I will recount the manifold mercies of the Lord; I will sing praises to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon us. I will recall the abundance of good things He has given to the house of Israel, which He bestowed upon them according to the greatness of His compassion and the multitude of His tender mercies.

(Isaiah 63:8) 
And He said: “Surely they are My people, My children who will not prove false to Me.” And so, He became their Savior.

(Isaiah 63:9) 
In all their affliction, He Himself was not afflicted, for the angel of His presence saved them. In His boundless love and His tender compassion, He personally redeemed them. He carried them and lifted them up throughout all the days of the ages.

(Isaiah 63:10) 
But they, in turn, rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He turned against them as an enemy, and He Himself fought against them.

(Isaiah 63:11) 
Then He remembered the days of old, the days of Moses and His people. The Lord asked, “Where is He who brought out from the sea the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who placed His Holy Spirit within them?”

(Isaiah 63:12) 
It was He who led Moses by his right hand, by His glorious majestic arm. He divided the waters of the sea before them to make for Himself an everlasting name for all time.

(Isaiah 63:13) 
He led them through the deep waters as easily as a horse walks through the desert without stumbling.

(Isaiah 63:14) 
Just like cattle returning to their pasture, the Spirit of the Lord was their guide. In this way, You led Your people, to make for Yourself a glorious name.

(Isaiah 63:15) 
Look down, O Lord, from the highest heavens, and behold us from Your holy and glorious dwelling place. Where is Your zealous care and Your mighty power? Where are the multitude of Your tender mercies and Your deep compassion? Are they now withheld from me?

(Isaiah 63:16) 
For You alone are our Father. Even if Abraham did not know us, and Jacob did not acknowledge us, You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer! From all eternity, this is Your name.

(Isaiah 63:17) 
Why, O Lord, have You allowed us to wander from Your ways? Why have You hardened our hearts so that we no longer revere You? Turn back, we pray, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your own inheritance.

(Isaiah 63:18) 
Why have You momentarily brought low Your holy people? Our enemies have now taken possession of Your holy sanctuary.

(Isaiah 63:19) 
We have become as though we were from the very beginning, when You had not yet ruled over us, and Your name was not yet invoked upon us.

(Isaiah 64:1) 
If only you would tear open the sky and come down to us, the mountains would melt away at your presence and power!

(Isaiah 64:2) 
Just as a fire burns away brushwood, and as a roaring fire makes water boil, so too would these mountains vanish and be utterly consumed. Do this so that you might make your power known to your enemies, and the nations would be terrified at your presence.

(Isaiah 64:3) 
When you have performed awesome, terrible deeds, we have waited for your appearance. You have descended in the past, and the mountains melted away at your presence and power.

(Isaiah 64:4) 
Since the beginning of time, no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen, O God, any other god but you who has prepared such wonders for those who wait for you.

(Isaiah 64:5) 
You come to meet those who rejoice in doing what is right and just. They will remember you as they walk in your paths. But truly, you were angry, and we sinned against you. We have remained in our sins and have been living in them constantly. Yet, even so, we trust that we shall be saved!

(Isaiah 64:6) 
Indeed, all of us have become like something ritually unclean, and all our supposed good deeds are like a soiled, discarded cloth. We have all withered and fallen away like a leaf, and our sins, like a strong wind, have swept us away into darkness.

(Isaiah 64:7) 
There is no one among us who truly calls upon your name, no one who truly rises up to seek and take hold of you. You have hidden your presence from us, and you have crushed us and delivered us into the power of our own sins.

(Isaiah 64:8) 
And yet now, O Lord, you are still our Father. We are merely the clay, and you are our divine Potter. All of us are the complete work of your own hands.

(Isaiah 64:9) 
Do not be angry beyond measure, O Lord, and please do not remember our sins forever! Look upon us, we beg you—we are all your own people.

(Isaiah 64:10) 
Your holy city has become a desolate wasteland. Zion itself has become a barren wilderness. Jerusalem is utterly destroyed.

(Isaiah 64:11) 
The very Temple, the house of our holiness and our glory, where our fathers praised you, has been utterly consumed by fire. And all our precious, desirable things have been reduced to rubble and ruin.

(Isaiah 64:12) 
Despite all these things, O Lord, will you continue to hold yourself back? Will you remain silent and afflict us so severely, allowing us to be utterly destroyed?

(Isaiah 65:65:1) 
Those who had not previously asked Me, searched for Me. Those who had not sought Me, found Me. I said, 'Here I am! Here I am!' to a nation—meaning the Gentiles—that never called upon My name.

(Isaiah 65:65:2) 
I continually extended My hands all day long to a disobedient people—My chosen nation, Israel—who walked in a path that was not good, choosing to follow their own rebellious thoughts.

(Isaiah 65:65:3) 
This is a people who constantly provoke My anger right before My face. They offer sacrifices in pagan gardens and burn incense on altars made of bricks, instead of honoring Me according to My law.

(Isaiah 65:65:4) 
These are people who dwell in tombs and sleep in pagan shrines, seeking to consult the dead. They eat the flesh of swine and have the broth of unclean things in their vessels—all of which are an abomination to Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:5) 
These are the ones who say, 'Keep away from me, do not come near me, for I am holier than you, and you would make me unclean!' Such people will be like smoke, consumed by My fiery anger, a fire that burns continuously throughout the day.

(Isaiah 65:65:6) 
Behold, it is written before Me: I will not remain silent, but I will surely repay. I will give them the full measure of their just retribution into their very laps.

(Isaiah 65:65:7) 
Your wickedness, along with the wickedness of your fathers together, says the Lord, who offered pagan sacrifices upon the mountains and publicly insulted Me upon the hills—I will repay the full measure of all their past sins into their laps.

(Isaiah 65:65:8) 
This is what the Lord says: 'Just as when a cluster of grapes is found to have one good grape, people say, 'Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing within it,' so also will I do for the sake of My faithful servants, so that I will not utterly destroy all of My people.

(Isaiah 65:65:9) 
And I will bring forth a remnant from Jacob, and from Judah will come those who inherit My holy mountains. My chosen ones will possess this land as their inheritance, and My faithful servants will live there securely.

(Isaiah 65:65:10) 
And the plains will become lush pastures for flocks of sheep, and the Valley of Achor—once a place of trouble—will become a peaceful resting place for herds of cattle. This will be for My people who have faithfully sought Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:11) 
But as for you who have abandoned the Lord, you who have forgotten My holy mountain of Zion, you who set a table in honor of the pagan god of Fortune, and who prepare wine offerings for the pagan goddess of Destiny—

(Isaiah 65:65:12) 
I will count you out for the sword, and all of you will fall in a great slaughter. This is because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen. Instead, you did what was evil in My sight and deliberately chose what greatly displeased Me.

(Isaiah 65:65:13) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: 'Behold, My faithful servants will eat and be satisfied, but you who rebelled will hunger. Behold, My servants will drink and be refreshed, but you will thirst. Behold, My servants will rejoice with gladness, but you will be put to utter shame.

(Isaiah 65:65:14) 
Behold, My servants will sing praises with overflowing joy from their hearts, but you will cry out with bitter sorrow in your hearts, and you will wail from the crushing despair of your spirit.

(Isaiah 65:65:15) 
And you who rebelled will leave your names as a curse and an oath for My chosen ones—meaning, 'May God do to me what He did to them.' The Lord God will put you to death, but He will call His faithful servants by a new name, signifying their new identity in Him.

(Isaiah 65:65:16) 
So that whoever is blessed upon the earth will be blessed in the God of Truth, and whoever takes an oath on earth will swear by the God of Truth. This will happen because the former troubles and sorrows are completely forgotten and hidden from My eyes forever.

(Isaiah 65:65:17) 
For behold, I am about to create new heavens and a new earth—a completely renewed creation. The former things, filled with sorrow and sin, will not even be remembered, nor will they ever come to mind.

(Isaiah 65:65:18) 
Instead, you will rejoice and be utterly exultant forever in the things that I am creating. For behold, I am creating Jerusalem to be a source of great rejoicing, and her people to be a source of profound joy.

(Isaiah 65:65:19) 
And I Myself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in My people. In that renewed city and among My people, the sound of weeping and the sound of distressful crying will never be heard again.

(Isaiah 65:65:20) 
In that time, there will no longer be an infant who lives only a few days, nor an old person who fails to complete the full measure of their years. For the one who dies at a hundred years old will be considered a mere child; but the sinner who lives a hundred years will still be cursed and face judgment.

(Isaiah 65:65:21) 
They will build houses and live in them securely. They will plant vineyards and enjoy their fruit.

(Isaiah 65:65:22) 
They will not build a house for someone else to live in; they will not plant a vineyard for someone else to eat its fruit. For the days of My people will be like the days of the Tree of Life itself, and they will fully enjoy the work of their hands.

(Isaiah 65:65:23) 
They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children destined for trouble or calamity. For they and their descendants are the blessed offspring of the Lord, and their grandchildren will remain with them.

(Isaiah 65:65:24) 
And it will be that even before they call out to Me, I will hear them. While they are still speaking their prayers, I Myself will immediately answer them.

(Isaiah 65:65:25) 
The wolf and the lamb will feed together in peace, and the lion will eat straw like the ox—its predatory nature transformed. As for the young serpents, dust will remain their food, signaling the final triumph over evil. There will be no harm or destruction anywhere on My holy mountain of creation, says the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:1) 
The Lord says these things: "The entire universe is My throne, and the earth is where I rest My feet. What kind of house could you possibly build for Me? And what kind of place could be My resting place?"

(Isaiah 66:2) 
"My hand made all these things, and all of them came into being," declares the Lord. "But who am I going to look upon with favor? Only those who are humble in spirit, those who have a contrite spirit, and those who tremble at My words."

(Isaiah 66:3) 
"Whoever sacrifices an ox, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who murders a man. Whoever sacrifices a lamb, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who sacrifices a dog's brain, which is an abomination. Whoever offers a grain offering, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who offers pig's blood, which is unclean. Whoever burns incense as a memorial, yet has no true devotion, is like someone who blesses an idol. All of these are things they have chosen according to their own corrupted ways, and their souls have delighted in their abominable practices."

(Isaiah 66:4) 
"Therefore, I will also choose their vexations, and I will bring upon them the very things they feared. This is because I called out to them, and there was no one who responded. I spoke, and they did not listen. Instead, they did evil in My sight, and they chose what I did not desire."

(Isaiah 66:5) 
"Listen to the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word. Your brethren, who hate you and cast you out because of My name, have said, 'Go far from us, for the Lord is honored!' But the Lord will appear in your joy, and those who persecuted you will be put to shame."

(Isaiah 66:6) 
There is a voice of a people crying out from the city. There is a voice crying out from the Temple. It is the voice of the Lord, rendering retribution to His enemies.

(Isaiah 66:7) 
Before she was in labor, she gave birth. Before her pains came, she bore a male child.

(Isaiah 66:8) 
Who has ever heard such a thing? And who has seen things like this? Will a land give birth to an entire nation in one day? Or will a whole people be born all at once? For Zion has travailed and given birth to her children.

(Isaiah 66:9) 
"Will I, who brings to the point of birth, then close the womb and not let her give birth?" declares the Lord. "Or will I, who forms all things, then shut the womb and prevent new life?" says your God.

(Isaiah 66:10) 
Rejoice with Jerusalem, and exult in her, all you who love her. Rejoice with her with joy, all you who mourn over her.

(Isaiah 66:11) 
so that you may nurse and be filled from the breast of her consolation. So that you may draw milk and overflow with delights from her abundant glory.

(Isaiah 66:12) 
For the Lord says these things: "Behold, I will extend peace to Jerusalem like a flowing river, and like an overflowing torrent, the glory and wealth of the nations will come to you, which you will draw from. You will be carried on her sides, and on her knees, you will be tenderly cared for."

(Isaiah 66:13) 
"Just as a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you. And in Jerusalem, you will find consolation."

(Isaiah 66:14) 
"You will see it, and your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like fresh grass, full of new life. And the hand of the Lord will be known to His servants, but He will show His wrath to His enemies."

(Isaiah 66:15) 
For behold, the Lord will come in fire, and His chariots will be like a whirlwind, to render His fury in indignation and His rebuke in a flame of fire.

(Isaiah 66:16) 
For the Lord will judge with fire and by His sword He will judge all flesh, and many will be slain by the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:17) 
"Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, following one among them in secret rituals, those who eat swine's flesh, and abominable things, and even mice—they will all be consumed together," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:18) 
"For I know their works and their thoughts. I am coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they will come and see My glory."

(Isaiah 66:19) 
"And I will set a sign among them. And from those who are saved among them, I will send them to the nations by the sea: to Africa and Lydia, nations known for their skilled archers; to Italy and Greece; to distant islands, to those who have not heard of Me and have not seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations."

(Isaiah 66:20) 
"And they will bring all your brethren from all nations as an offering to the Lord, conveyed on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and in wagons, to My holy mountain Jerusalem," declares the Lord. "This will be just as the sons of Israel bring their offering in clean vessels into the house of the Lord."

(Isaiah 66:21) 
"And I will also choose some of them, even from the Gentiles, to serve as priests and as Levites," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:22) 
"For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I am making, will stand firm before Me," declares the Lord, "so also will your offspring and your name stand firm forever."

(Isaiah 66:23) 
"And it will be that from one new moon to the next new moon, and from one Sabbath to the next Sabbath, all flesh will come to worship before My face," declares the Lord.

(Isaiah 66:24) 
"And they will go out and see the corpses of the men who transgressed against Me. Their worm will not die, and their fire will not be extinguished. And they will be a terrifying spectacle to all flesh, a perpetual warning against sin."
