(Judith 1:1) 
Arphaxad, the king of the Medes, conquered many nations. He himself built a very powerful city, which he named Ecbatana.

(Judith 1:2) 
He built its walls with squared and cut stones. The walls were seventy cubits high—a cubit being the length from elbow to fingertip—and thirty cubits wide.

(Judith 1:3) 
He also placed towers by its gates, each one a hundred cubits high and sixty cubits wide.

(Judith 1:4) 
He made its gates seventy cubits high and forty cubits wide, so that his armies and his vast numbers of infantry troops could march out to battle.

(Judith 1:5) 
In the twelfth year of his reign, King Arphaxad began to wage war against Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians. Nebuchadnezzar reigned in the great city of Nineveh. In those days, he was conquering and possessing all the upper kingdoms from Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon, and from Cedes, and through all the upper territories as far as the great Euphrates River.

(Judith 1:6) 
He also ruled across the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and Adria, and in the plain of Arioch, king of the Elymaeans. Many nations of the sons of Chelod had also submitted to his rule.

(Judith 1:7) 
Therefore, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians, sent messengers to all those who lived in Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon. He also sent them to those who lived in Carmel and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Esdrelon.

(Judith 1:8) 
He sent messengers to all those who were in Samaria and across the Jordan River, as far as Jerusalem. He sent them to all the land of Jesse, reaching even to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Judith 1:9) 
To all these peoples, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians, sent his envoys.

(Judith 1:10) 
But all of them, with one voice, refused him. They sent his envoys away empty-handed and dismissed them without honor.

(Judith 1:11) 
Then King Nebuchadnezzar, enraged against all that land, swore by his throne and his kingdom that he would take vengeance on all those regions.

(Judith 1:12) 
In the thirteenth year of his reign, he gathered together all those who served alone in his army and who were prepared to fight Arphaxad, for his own might.

(Judith 1:13) 
This vast force consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand fighting infantrymen, and twelve thousand archers on horseback. He distributed them throughout his most level plains.

(Judith 1:14) 
He fortified his troops over an abundance of waters, and he marched up to King Arphaxad in the great plain of Ragau.

(Judith 1:15) 
King Arphaxad advanced to meet him with his infantry, his cavalry, and a very great and numerous army.

(Judith 1:16) 
But King Nebuchadnezzar struck down Arphaxad, along with his forces and all his cavalry, and put them to flight.

(Judith 1:1) 
In the twelfth year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, when he ruled the Assyrians from the great city of Nineveh, Arphaxad was king over the Medes in Ecbatana.

(Judith 1:2) 
This King Arphaxad had built massive walls around Ecbatana using squared and carefully cut stones. Each wall section was seven feet wide, thirty cubits long (a cubit is roughly 18 inches), and sixty-six cubits high.

(Judith 1:3) 
He also constructed gate towers that were one hundred cubits tall and sixty cubits wide at their foundation.

(Judith 1:4) 
The actual gates themselves were seventy cubits high and forty cubits wide, specifically designed to allow powerful armies to march out and infantry to form their battle lines.

(Judith 1:5) 
During this period, King Nebuchadnezzar waged war against King Arphaxad, utterly defeating Arphaxad's army in every engagement.

(Judith 1:6) 
Nebuchadnezzar captured Arphaxad's cavalry, all his chariots, and his entire military force.

(Judith 1:7) 
He then seized control of Arphaxad's territory. When Nebuchadnezzar reached Ecbatana, he completely demolished its towers and walls, reducing all its strongholds to rubble.

(Judith 1:8) 
Nebuchadnezzar captured Arphaxad in the Ragau mountains, executed him, and then returned to Nineveh. He brought with him all the plunder from his army, including horses, chariots, and captured warriors.

(Judith 1:9) 
Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army stayed in Nineveh for one hundred and twenty days, celebrating their victory with continuous feasting and drinking.

(Judith 1:10) 
After these hundred and twenty days of celebration, King Nebuchadnezzar sent messengers to all the peoples living in Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon.

(Judith 1:11) 
He also sent messages to the nations in Carmel, Kedar, and Gilead, as well as to all of Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon.

(Judith 1:12) 
The messengers were sent to everyone in Samaria, all the people living across the Jordan River up to Jerusalem, and throughout all the land of Jesse (which is Judea), extending as far as the borders of Ethiopia.

(Judith 1:13) 
King Nebuchadnezzar sent his envoys to all these diverse peoples and regions.

(Judith 1:14) 
However, with one accord, every single one of them defied him and refused to join him in his military campaign.

(Judith 1:15) 
They openly scorned his authority. Consequently, his messengers returned to him empty-handed, having failed in their mission.

(Judith 1:16) 
King Nebuchadnezzar became extremely furious with all those lands. He solemnly swore by his royal throne and his kingdom that he would exact vengeance upon all of these rebellious regions.

(Judith 1:17) 
Therefore, in the very next year, his thirteenth year of reign, Nebuchadnezzar immediately dispatched Holofernes, the commander-in-chief of his army, leading all his military might.

(Judith 1:18) 
He gave Holofernes strict orders to attack and conquer all the territory of Coele-Syria and its surrounding regions, specifically targeting those who had spoken proudly and defied him.

(Judith 1:19) 
Holofernes began his campaign with a massive army: one hundred and twenty thousand infantrymen, and twelve thousand cavalry, complete with their chariots and crews.

(Judith 1:20) 
He led his entire army, with all their horses and chariots, up into the mountainous regions. He marched through them and then deployed his forces across all the land of Gabba.

(Judith 1:21) 
He successfully conquered all their territories, from the highest mountains down to Chaion, extending even to the borders of Ethiopia—a vast area indeed.

(Judith 1:22) 
Holofernes then advanced against all the descendants of Ishmael and Keturah. He established his camp in the desert, extending as far as Ephron, and continued his campaign by crossing through Arabia.

(Judith 1:23) 
He encircled all the descendants of Midian, set fire to every one of their cities, and seized all their military camps.

(Judith 1:24) 
He arrived in the plain of Damascus during the wheat harvest. There, he burned all their crops, and systematically cut down all their trees and vineyards, devastating their land.

(Judith 1:25) 
A profound dread of Holofernes now fell upon all the inhabitants of Cilicia, Damascus, and those who resided in Lebanon.

(Judith 1:26) 
Holofernes then sent messengers to all the people living in Syria-Zobah and throughout all the coastal regions.

(Judith 1:27) 
He sent them also to those residing in Phoenicia, Gaza, Ashkelon, and other coastal towns.

(Judith 1:28) 
The messengers went to the inhabitants of Joppa and Ekron, as well as to all the people of Israel and the entire land of Jesse (Judea), extending once more to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Judith 1:29) 
In response, everyone from these regions came out to meet Holofernes, wearing crowns on their heads and carrying olive branches—symbols of peace and surrender.

(Judith 1:30) 
They prostrated themselves before him on the ground, showing him profound deference and homage.

(Judith 1:31) 
They pleaded with him, saying, 'Oh great lord, our lord, take from us whatever pleases you.'

(Judith 1:32) 
'Treat your servants as you see fit.'

(Judith 1:33) 
'Behold, we and all our possessions are completely at your disposal.'

(Judith 1:34) 
'All our regions, our fortresses, and our cities are laid before you.'

(Judith 1:35) 
'Use them as you please, and as seems best to you.'

(Judith 1:36) 
And so, in those days, all these regions and peoples found peace and agreement with Holofernes.

(Judith 1:37) 
They all gathered together peacefully in one place to signify their submission.

(Judith 1:38) 
After receiving their submission, Holofernes descended from their mountainous territories.

(Judith 1:39) 
He then established his military camps throughout all their borders and lands.

(Judith 1:40) 
And at this point, he also received the submission of all the people of Israel.

(Judith 2:1) 
In the thirteenth year of King Nabuchodonosor's reign, on the twenty-second day of the first month, a decree was issued from the palace of Nabuchodonosor, the king of the Assyrians, concerning how he would defend himself.

(Judith 2:2) 
And so he called together all the elders, all the generals, and all his warriors. He held a secret council with them.

(Judith 2:3) 
And he told them that his plan was to conquer the entire known world.

(Judith 2:4) 
Everyone living in Nineveh had heard this. They knew how Nabuchodonosor, the king of the Assyrians, had defeated Arphaxad on the great plain, and how he had then taken control of all the vast population of the Eastern lands.

(Judith 2:5) 
They also knew how he had seized their cities and provinces, conquering them all the way to the borders of Ethiopia.

(Judith 2:6) 
So, King Nabuchodonosor of the Assyrians sent messengers throughout all the land, to every man who dwelled within the entirety of his borders.

(Judith 2:7) 
And he declared to them that they must prepare themselves for a war against the entire known world.

(Judith 2:8) 
But every single one of them united to oppose him. They became enraged in his presence, and sent him away, his demands rejected and his purpose unfulfilled.

(Judith 2:9) 
Then Nabuchodonosor, consumed by furious and immense anger, called Holofernes, the commander of his army, and said to him:

(Judith 2:10) 
"Look, you have left my presence, and you refused to listen to my words of peace" —this is Nabuchodonosor's perspective, implying the regions didn't listen to his 'offer' of submission.

(Judith 2:11) 
"Now, command that you gather a vast army: one hundred and twenty thousand infantry soldiers and twelve thousand cavalry."

(Judith 2:12) 
"And then, march out against all the lands to the west, because they have disobeyed the command of my own mouth."

(Judith 2:13) 
"And proclaim to them that they must prepare for war and send me ten thousand men from each city and province throughout all their territory."

(Judith 2:14) 
And he commanded Holofernes to spare no one, except those who willingly offered themselves to him in servitude.

(Judith 2:15) 
And he ordered him that all who resisted his command should be put to death.

(Judith 2:16) 
Then Holofernes departed from the presence of his king. He called together all his elders, generals, and warriors.

(Judith 2:17) 
And he gathered one hundred and twenty thousand chosen men, along with twelve thousand cavalry, complete with their archers.

(Judith 2:18) 
He also took with him an countless multitude of camels, mules, and donkeys. He requisitioned many supply ships, and made sure to prepare wood and water provisions for himself and his army.

(Judith 2:19) 
He himself marched out, and his entire army, fully equipped with cavalry, chariots, archers, catapults, and every kind of war machine.

(Judith 2:20) 
And he traveled through every place, through every land, every region, every nation, every people, every language group, every tribe, every province, every city, and every village —this is hyperbole to emphasize the extent of his campaign.

(Judith 2:21) 
He reached the borders of Nineveh, crossed the Euphrates River, and then traversed the entirety of Mesopotamia.

(Judith 2:22) 
He came to the borders of Cilicia and marched through all its territories.

(Judith 2:23) 
He then arrived at the borders of Syria and advanced through all its lands.

(Judith 2:24) 
Next, he reached the borders of Phoenicia and passed through all its regions.

(Judith 2:25) 
He proceeded to the borders of Palestine and advanced through all its territories.

(Judith 2:26) 
He then reached the borders of Judea and marched through all its lands.

(Judith 2:27) 
From there, he arrived at the borders of Idumea and passed through all its regions.

(Judith 2:28) 
He then came to the borders of Arabia and moved through all its territories.

(Judith 2:29) 
After that, he reached the borders of Egypt and advanced through all its lands.

(Judith 2:30) 
He proceeded to the borders of Libya and marched through all its regions.

(Judith 2:31) 
From there, he arrived at the borders of Ethiopia and passed through all its territories.

(Judith 2:32) 
He then reached the borders of Persia and moved through all its lands.

(Judith 2:33) 
Next, he came to the borders of Media and advanced through all its regions.

(Judith 2:34) 
He proceeded to the borders of the Chaldeans and marched through all their territories.

(Judith 2:35) 
He then reached the borders of the Assyrians and passed through all their lands.

(Judith 2:36) 
From there, he arrived at the borders of Babylon and moved through all its regions.

(Judith 2:37) 
Next, he came to the borders of Susiana and advanced through all its territories.

(Judith 2:38) 
He proceeded to the borders of the Elamites and marched through all their lands.

(Judith 2:39) 
He then reached the borders of the Parthians and passed through all their regions.

(Judith 2:40) 
Finally, he arrived at the borders of the Indians and moved through all their territories.

(Judith 2:1) 
It happened that when Holofernes, the chief commander of the Assyrian armies, heard this, he became extremely angry. He then planned to crush all the land—meaning, to utterly destroy all nations—just as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Assyria, had commanded him.

(Judith 2:2) 
He called all the high-ranking elders, and the military leaders, and the officers of his army. In their presence, he shared his plan with them.

(Judith 2:3) 
And he said: "My heart is set. I will not spare any land. Just as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Assyria, has spoken, so I will do."

(Judith 2:4) 
He added, saying: "Behold, our king, Nebuchadnezzar, has commanded me to go to every land and to wipe out all those who have not submitted to him."

(Judith 2:5) 
He continued to speak, now directly to Holofernes, as if he himself was Nebuchadnezzar: "And you, Holofernes, who are the commander of my army, go ahead, and I will lead the way for you. I will go with you, and we will not spare any people who have not submitted to me."

(Judith 2:6) 
He added, as Nebuchadnezzar instructing Holofernes: "And you, prepare an army for yourself. Gather for yourself men from all the men who are in my army."

(Judith 2:7) 
And Holofernes called his commanders and the officers of the army. He counted those who were prepared for the campaign.

(Judith 2:8) 
And they assembled the army. There were one hundred thirty thousand infantrymen and twelve thousand cavalrymen, in addition to the baggage and wagons, which were in great abundance, signifying a massive force.

(Judith 2:9) 
And Holofernes sent messengers into every region he planned to conquer. These messengers made sure that provisions like food, water, wood, straw, hay, and every kind of sustenance were prepared for his army as it advanced.

(Judith 2:10) 
He himself marched through Cilicia, striking down all who resisted him. He advanced as far as the borders of Japheth—a region possibly referring to northern territories or descendants of Japheth. He then marched through all the sons of Ophir and Media, and he struck down all who resisted him, reaching the borders of Syria.

(Judith 2:11) 
And Holofernes marched through Syria Sobal, and all of Mesopotamia. He struck down all who resisted him, and he arrived at the borders of Cilicia—retracing his steps to consolidate his vast territorial gains.

(Judith 2:12) 
Holofernes then came into Idumaea, and into Moab, and into the land of the sons of Ammon. He captured them, and he devastated their cities. He passed through all the land, striking down all who resisted him, and he reached as far as the borders of the Arab regions.

(Judith 2:13) 
Holofernes came into Upper Galilee and into all the land of Canaan. He struck down all who resisted him, and he seized all their territories, and he established his forces there.

(Judith 2:14) 
Holofernes then came into the plain of Esdraelon, near Dothan, and he established his forces there—positioning himself strategically in the heart of the land.

(Judith 2:15) 
Holofernes came into all the mountainous regions. He passed through every land, striking down all who resisted him, and reached as far as the borders of Samaria.

(Judith 2:16) 
Holofernes then came into all the land beyond the Jordan River. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—continuing his relentless expansion.

(Judith 2:17) 
Holofernes also came into all the land beyond Lebanon. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—further extending his dominion.

(Judith 2:18) 
Holofernes then came into all the coastal land. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there.

(Judith 2:19) 
Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his campaign of domination continued without pause.

(Judith 2:20) 
And Holofernes came into all the desert land. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no region unconquered.

(Judith 2:21) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—demonstrating his overwhelming power.

(Judith 2:22) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his reach now extending far and wide.

(Judith 2:23) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his campaign was total.

(Judith 2:24) 
Holofernes then came into all the coastal land again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—reinforcing his grip on these crucial areas.

(Judith 2:25) 
Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—confirming his complete conquest.

(Judith 2:26) 
And Holofernes came into all the desert land again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no part untouched by his devastation.

(Judith 2:27) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his control was absolute.

(Judith 2:28) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his dominion was firmly established.

(Judith 2:29) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his destructive path knew no bounds.

(Judith 2:30) 
Holofernes then came into all the coastal land a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—the cycle of conquest and re-conquest continued relentlessly.

(Judith 2:31) 
Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his command was repeatedly enforced.

(Judith 2:32) 
And Holofernes came into all the desert land a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his army was an omnipresent threat.

(Judith 2:33) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—each conquest solidifying his brutal reign.

(Judith 2:34) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his authority was felt everywhere.

(Judith 2:35) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no doubt about his absolute power.

(Judith 2:36) 
Holofernes then came into all the coastal land a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his relentless campaign of subjugation continued.

(Judith 2:37) 
Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his domination was total and unyielding.

(Judith 2:38) 
And Holofernes came into all the desert land a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his presence was felt in every corner of the conquered lands.

(Judith 2:39) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his control over the region was absolute and continually reinforced.

(Judith 2:40) 
And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his empire was now stretched across a vast and diverse set of regions, all subjected to his will.

(Judith 3:1) 
And the children of Israel, who lived in the land of Judea, heard everything that Holofernes had done to the rulers of the nations. They heard how he had plundered all their regions and laid waste to all their territories.

(Judith 3:2) 
So they feared him greatly, and they also feared the immense power of his army. It was an exceedingly vast army, prepared to consume and conquer all the land.

(Judith 3:3) 
They were deeply troubled and trembled with fear before him.

(Judith 3:4) 
They secured all the borders of their land. They occupied all the high mountains and fortified places, and they set up defenses within them.

(Judith 3:5) 
They ritually purified their clothing and put on sackcloth as a sign of mourning. They threw themselves face down on the ground all around God's Temple. They cried out loudly, weeping that Holofernes would kill those serving around the altar and seize their Holy Temple.

(Judith 3:6) 
And they sent messengers to every border of Israel, telling them to prepare their cities to face Holofernes and to gather together in every stronghold.

(Judith 3:7) 
And all of Israel gathered together with one accord, intending to protect their own lives, as well as the lives of their wives, their children, their livestock, and all their animals.

(Judith 3:8) 
Every man of strength and every warrior from Israel was called together into one unified force.

(Judith 3:9) 
They occupied and strengthened their high mountain positions, and they fortified their cities.

(Judith 3:10) 
Again, they ritually purified their clothing and put on sackcloth. They threw themselves face down on the ground, and they begged God to save them.

(Judith 4:1) 
When the children of Israel heard that Holofernes, the king of the Assyrians, was greatly expanding his territory and that he was coming towards them by way of the coastal road,

(Judith 4:2) 
they were extremely afraid of him, considering all that he had done to the regions that were near them.

(Judith 4:3) 
They were also greatly alarmed by the sheer size of his army, because they had no way to resist them.

(Judith 4:4) 
The people of Israel grew weary with fear, and they cried out to the Lord their God with great urgency. Both the men and their wives humbled themselves with fasting and prayers.

(Judith 4:5) 
The priests dressed themselves in sackcloth and placed ashes on their heads in the midst of Israel. They cried out to the Lord with all urgency that He would protect His people Israel.

(Judith 4:6) 
Ozias announced to Joakim, the high priest, and to all the elders of their cities, that everyone should gather in Jerusalem.

(Judith 4:7) 
They wrote to all the inhabitants of Israel who were in Samaria, in the mountainous regions, and those who were beyond the Jordan. They ordered that everyone should hurry and prepare the roads for defense, the very roads Holofernes had approached.

(Judith 4:8) 
They fortified all the high mountain passes through which an enemy could easily pass, and they placed garrisons in the towns.

(Judith 4:9) 
They took their positions on the tops of the mountains and fortified them, placing their army to guard the routes.

(Judith 4:10) 
And word came to Holofernes, according to reports that involved Joakim, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for battle and had blocked the mountain passes.

(Judith 4:11) 
Holofernes was greatly inflamed with anger. He called all the princes of Moab, the leaders of Ammon, and all the prefects of the coastal region to him.

(Judith 4:12) 
He said to them, 'Tell me, sons of Canaan, who are these people who dwell in the mountains? What are their cities like? How large is their army, and what is the source of their strength? Why do they resist me and refuse to surrender to me?'

(Judith 4:13) 
Achior, the leader of all the sons of Ammon, answered and said, 'Hear, O lord, a word from your servant. I will tell you the truth about this people who live in the mountains, according to what is known about the children of Israel.'

(Judith 4:14) 
This people originated from the Chaldeans.

(Judith 4:15) 
They settled first in Mesopotamia but refused to follow the ancestral gods who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 4:16) 
They departed from their idolatrous ways and worshipped the God of the universe, the true God whom they had come to know.

(Judith 4:17) 
The Chaldeans then drove them away from their gods, so they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.

(Judith 4:18) 
From there, they migrated and came into the land of Canaan. There, they multiplied greatly and became very powerful, possessing much gold, silver, and vast herds of livestock.

(Judith 4:19) 
Then they went down into Egypt and became such an immense multitude that no one could count their descendants.

(Judith 4:20) 
The Egyptians afflicted them with forced labor in clay and brick-making, humiliating them until they became slaves.

(Judith 4:21) 
They cried out to their God, and He struck the land of Egypt with miraculous signs, bringing them out from among the Egyptians.

(Judith 4:22) 
God parted the Red Sea for them, and He led them through the desert of Sinai, providing for all their needs abundantly.

(Judith 4:23) 
They lived in the land of Canaan, where God established them as they built cities and planted trees. All the peoples from the mountains were rooted out before them.

(Judith 4:24) 
They became exceedingly powerful in gold and silver, and in their vast herds of livestock, so that their multitude could not be counted.

(Judith 4:25) 
But they sinned against their God and made idols. Because of this, they were cast out from their land and scattered throughout every land.

(Judith 4:26) 
When they did not sin before their God, their God was merciful to them, because He hates iniquity.

(Judith 4:27) 
But when they turned aside from the way He had given them to walk in, they were destroyed in war by many nations and led away into lands that were not their own.

(Judith 4:28) 
And now they have returned to their God, even after enduring hunger, thirst, and many enemies in the desert. Because they returned to Him, they have plundered every nation that fell into their hands.

(Judith 4:29) 
In every place where the children of Israel were, their God saved them. He prepared places for them in the mountains and established them there.

(Judith 4:30) 
And now, therefore, my lord king, if there is any iniquity in this people, and they are sinning against their God, let us discover it. Then we can go up against them and conquer them.

(Judith 4:31) 
But if there is no offense in this nation, I advise you to keep away from them, lest their Lord perhaps defend them and you become a disgrace to all the earth.

(Judith 4:32) 
When Achior finished speaking these words, all the people around the camps murmured.

(Judith 4:33) 
Holofernes' princes and all his ministers, as well as the nearby leaders of the Moabites and Ammonites, were enraged by Achior's words.

(Judith 4:34) 
They said, 'Shall we then be unable to strike the children of Israel because their strength is great and their God helps them?'

(Judith 4:35) 
Holofernes said, 'Who is God besides Nabuchodonosor? He alone is lord and king, and God of all the earth! He himself will strike them down through my hand.'

(Judith 4:36) 
They led Achior out of the camps and took him as far as the mountains, where they tied him to a tree and left him.

(Judith 4:37) 
Then they returned to their own camps.

(Judith 4:38) 
The children of Israel took Achior and brought him to Ozias and the leaders of the city, and he sat in their midst.

(Judith 4:39) 
He recounted to them everything that Holofernes had spoken, and all the words that the people had said, and the threats Holofernes had made against Israel.

(Judith 4:40) 
The people prostrated themselves on the ground, worshipped God, and cried out to the Lord, saying:

(Judith 4:1) 
But the children of Israel, who were living in the land of Judea, heard about all the things Holofernes had done to the chiefs of the nations and how he had plundered all their holy places. They were greatly terrified of him.

(Judith 4:2) 
They were extremely agitated because of Holofernes, and because of what could happen to the city of Jerusalem, and to the Temple of the Lord their God.

(Judith 4:3) 
For they had only very recently returned from a great slaughter, and all the people of Judea had just been gathered back from the captivity that devastated Jerusalem.

(Judith 4:4) 
And all the people were still new to the land of Judea, and their sacred vessels, the altar, and the Temple itself had only just been restored from their defilement.

(Judith 4:5) 
So they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem.

(Judith 4:6) 
And they began to seize all the tops of the highest mountains, and they fortified these with strongholds, and they gathered provisions in preparation for war.

(Judith 4:7) 
And Joakim, the high priest, wrote to those who were in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which is opposite Esdraelon, near the great plain, facing it.

(Judith 4:8) 
Through this place, an exit could be provided for the enemy to pass through to Judea, so they should cut off access there, preventing the enemy from passing through.

(Judith 4:9) 
For the approach to Judea was difficult and narrow, almost like a path for only two people, so that no more than one, or at most two, could pass through at the same time.

(Judith 4:10) 
And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord their God with great urgency, and they humbled their souls with much fasting.

(Judith 4:11) 
And the priests, and the Levites, and all who were living in Jerusalem, girded themselves with sackcloth, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, and put ashes on their heads.

(Judith 4:12) 
And the priests covered the altar with sackcloth, and they offered sacrifices to the Lord, and also made solemn vows to the Lord.

(Judith 4:13) 
And they cried out to the Lord God of Israel, asking that He would not deliver them as prey to those who wanted to destroy them and to cast down their inheritance—the land and the covenant given to them.

(Judith 4:14) 
And the Lord heard their voice, and He looked upon their affliction.

(Judith 4:15) 
And all the people of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, began to prostrate themselves before the Temple, to pray humbly to the Lord, and to sprinkle ashes on their heads.

(Judith 4:16) 
And dressed in sackcloth, they cried out to the Lord with all their might, that He would visit His people Israel with goodness and salvation.

(Judith 4:17) 
And that He would overthrow the enemy's army in the sight of those who were provoking them to such torment.

(Judith 4:18) 
And that He would scatter the powerful army of Holofernes, which wanted to kill them.

(Judith 4:19) 
And after two days, all the children of Israel abstained from all the produce of the land.

(Judith 4:20) 
And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.

(Judith 4:21) 
Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.

(Judith 4:22) 
So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.

(Judith 4:23) 
Therefore, all the children of Israel in the land of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, fasted for thirty days before the Lord, and prayed without ceasing.

(Judith 4:24) 
And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.

(Judith 4:25) 
Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.

(Judith 4:26) 
So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.

(Judith 4:27) 
And just as our fathers fasted in the desert, and just as Moses fasted for forty days and nights, so also let us fast in this war.

(Judith 4:28) 
And they placed the war on Mount Zion before the Lord, and the war in the city of Jerusalem before the Lord.

(Judith 4:29) 
And Joakim the high priest said to those who were in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, that they should not give the enemies an exit.

(Judith 4:30) 
And that they should hold the mountain under siege, and that the city should be fortified with strong defenses.

(Judith 4:31) 
So they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem.

(Judith 4:32) 
And all who were in these places, hearing the word of the high priest and the prefect, feared Holofernes greatly, and all gathered together as one to help their brothers.

(Judith 4:33) 
And in all their cities, and in all their borders, they prepared for war and fortified their cities.

(Judith 4:34) 
And they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem, telling them to hold the mountain under siege, and that the city should be fortified with strong defenses.

(Judith 4:35) 
Therefore, all the children of Israel in the land of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, fasted for thirty days before the Lord, and prayed without ceasing.

(Judith 4:36) 
And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.

(Judith 4:37) 
Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.

(Judith 4:38) 
So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.

(Judith 4:39) 
And just as our fathers fasted in the desert, and just as Moses fasted for forty days and nights, so also let us fast in this war.

(Judith 4:40) 
And they placed the war on Mount Zion before the Lord, and the war in the city of Jerusalem before the Lord.

(Judith 5:1) 
It was reported to Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army, that the children of Israel were preparing themselves for battle and had closed off the mountain passes. They had also taken control of every high mountain peak and placed guards there.

(Judith 5:2) 
Holofernes became extremely angry. He called together all the princes of Moab, the leaders of Ammon, and all the governors from the coastal regions.

(Judith 5:3) 
He said to them: 'Tell me, what kind of people are these who live in the mountains? What is their city, or what are their cities? How strong are they? What is their excellence, given that they have offered me so little resistance and have not come out to meet me?'

(Judith 5:4) 
Then Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, replied and said: 'If you would be pleased to listen, my lord, I will speak the truth in your presence about these people who live in the mountains, and no lie will come out of my mouth.'

(Judith 5:5) 
These people are descendants of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 5:6) 
They first settled in Mesopotamia, because they refused to follow the gods of their ancestors, who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 5:7) 
They turned away from the ways of their fathers and served a multitude of idols.

(Judith 5:8) 
And because of this, the anger of their God rose against them. They were driven out of their homeland and migrated to the region of Mesopotamia, where they lived for a long time.

(Judith 5:9) 
Their God told them to leave their dwelling place and go into the land of Canaan. They settled there and became extremely wealthy in gold, silver, and vast numbers of livestock.

(Judith 5:10) 
Then they went down into Egypt and lived there for four hundred years, so much so that their descendants multiplied greatly.

(Judith 5:11) 
But when the king of Egypt dominated them and oppressed them with forced labor, building cities with bricks and clay, they cried out to their Lord. Their Lord then struck the entire land of Egypt with various plagues.

(Judith 5:12) 
Their God then led them out of the land of Egypt and performed wonders for them.

(Judith 5:13) 
He divided the Red Sea into twelve parts and led them across on dry ground. He drowned all those who pursued them, along with their great army, in that same sea.

(Judith 5:14) 
They took the land of Edom and of all the children of Moab, and they lived in it, as they came into Canaan.

(Judith 5:15) 
They drove out all the inhabitants of the mountainous land.

(Judith 5:16) 
They lived in the regions of these lands and became powerful in the mountains of Edom and Syria. They settled there.

(Judith 5:17) 
As often as they did not sin in the sight of their God, good things were with them. For their God hates iniquity.

(Judith 5:18) 
But after they turned away from the path that their God had given them, they were destroyed in wars by many nations. Many of them were led away captive into lands that were not their own.

(Judith 5:19) 
The temple of their God was brought low, their dwelling places on earth were destroyed, and their heavenly sacrifice—the sacrifices they offered to God—was laid waste.

(Judith 5:20) 
But when they returned to their Lord God, coming up from the captivity where they had been scattered, and took possession of Jerusalem—where their Sanctuary is—and settled in the mountains, because the mountains had been desolate:

(Judith 5:21) 
Now, my lord the king, if you would be pleased to inquire of your servant, if there is any iniquity among them in the sight of their God, let us go up to them. For then their God can deliver them to you, and they will be brought under the yoke of your power.

(Judith 5:22) 
However, if there is no offense committed by these people in the sight of their God, we will not be able to resist them. For their God will defend them, and we will become a disgrace to the entire world.

(Judith 5:23) 
And it came to pass: when these words that Achior had spoken ceased, all the princes of Holofernes became very angry. They planned to kill him, saying:

(Judith 5:24) 
'Who is this man, to say to the children of Israel that their God will defend them? As if they truly have the strength of demons!'

(Judith 5:25) 
Now then, Holofernes, commander of the army, because his words are true, let us seize him and send him into the city of Bethulia. Then we will see him killed along with the others.

(Judith 5:26) 
So that when the city is captured, he too will perish by our hand. Then he will know that Holofernes is as powerful as our god, and our land will take revenge with their spears.

(Judith 5:27) 
Holofernes then said to Achior: 'Because you have prophesied, saying that the nation of Israel is defended by their God, you are to show that there is no God except Nebuchadnezzar: when we have killed all of them as if they were one man, then you too will perish with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and you will be completely destroyed along with the entire nation of Israel.'

(Judith 5:28) 
And I will show you that Nebuchadnezzar is the lord of the entire earth, and there is no other besides him.

(Judith 5:29) 
When you return, and are found dead among them, you will acknowledge that the god who sent you against us is indeed present in all our region.

(Judith 5:30) 
And they themselves, when they have taken you, will lead you to the mountain of Bethulia and place you on its summit.

(Judith 5:31) 
And if they are put to shame by the one who is in the mountains, or if there is nothing there that you believe in them, he will not find you as dead, and then we will restore you as one who is not slain.

(Judith 5:32) 
But if their God is not their strength, as you suppose, then he will deliver you into our hands, and we will kill the entire nation of Israel. I will make sure you die, and you will not find yourself among them. Then we will deal with you as one who has not been slain.

(Judith 5:33) 
And he [your God] does not wish for you to avoid death; rather, I myself will kill you.

(Judith 5:34) 
Therefore, take him, lead him to the mountain of Bethulia, place him on its summit, and leave him there.

(Judith 5:35) 
So they took Achior, went out from the camp, came to the mountain of Bethulia, and placed him on its summit.

(Judith 5:36) 
And behold, the children of Israel were on the summit of the mountain, and seeing him, they came down to him.

(Judith 5:37) 
They took him and led him into Bethulia and placed him in their midst.

(Judith 5:38) 
And he recounted to them everything that had happened to him from Holofernes, and how Holofernes' people had planned to kill him.

(Judith 5:39) 
He told them how he himself had spoken about his own people, and how Holofernes had spoken about him, and how he had decided to kill him.

(Judith 5:40) 
And all the children of Israel, hearing the words of Achior, were greatly afraid. They prostrated themselves on the ground and worshipped God, and said:

(Judith 5:1) 
It was reported to Holofernes, the general of the Assyrian army, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for battle and had blocked the mountain pass.

(Judith 5:2) 
Holofernes became extremely angry. He then summoned all the leaders of Moab, the commanders of Ammon, and all the chieftains of the coastal region.

(Judith 5:3) 
He said to them: "Tell me, people of Canaan, who are these people living in the mountains? What is their city, or what is their country? What is their strength, and how numerous are they?"

(Judith 5:4) 
Who is the commander of their army? And why do these people alone refuse to come and meet me, when all who live in the eastern regions have submitted?

(Judith 5:5) 
Then Achior, the leader of all the people of Ammon, replied: "Listen, General, to what your servant has to say. I will speak the truth in your presence, for no lie will come from my mouth before you."

(Judith 5:6) 
These people are descendants of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 5:7) 
They first settled in Mesopotamia because they refused to follow the gods of their ancestors, who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 5:8) 
They deviated from the path of their parents and worshipped the God of the sky, the God whom they came to know. Their own gods then rejected them, so they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.

(Judith 5:9) 
Then their God told them to leave their dwelling place and go into the land of Canaan. They remained in that land, becoming rich in gold and silver, and possessing a very large amount of livestock.

(Judith 5:10) 
From there, they went down into Egypt and lived there until the famine in the land of Canaan ended. They multiplied and became a great people there, so much so that their multitude was countless.

(Judith 5:11) 
Because of this, the king of Egypt resisted them. He humiliated them by making them work with mud and bricks, and he made them his slaves.

(Judith 5:12) 
They cried out to their God, and He struck the land of Egypt with various plagues.

(Judith 5:13) 
When the Egyptians had driven them out, and they had fled the plague sent by God, the Egyptians wanted to pursue them and bring them back to their own territories.

(Judith 5:14) 
Then the God of the sky cried out, and the waters dried up. They crossed the Red Sea on their journey into the desert, abandoning all their former boundaries.

(Judith 5:15) 
They lived in the deserts of Mount Sinai, and they caused many disputes against the God of the sky.

(Judith 5:16) 
And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.

(Judith 5:17) 
And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.

(Judith 5:18) 
And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:

(Judith 5:19) 
And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.

(Judith 5:20) 
And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.

(Judith 5:21) 
And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:

(Judith 5:22) 
And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.

(Judith 5:23) 
And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.

(Judith 5:24) 
And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:

(Judith 6:1) 
Holofernes said to Achior: "Because you are from Judea, and like one of the captives from Israel, you have spoken these words to me as if I would not change my mind and act against you with malice."

(Judith 6:2) 
But do not think you will survive, while you despise the strength and power of Holofernes.

(Judith 6:3) 
And this will happen to you—you will not live—because you will not immediately be allowed to leave our land. Instead, you will be taken to the mountain where your people are gathered.

(Judith 6:4) 
So that, when the sword of my mouth has cut them down, and you likewise perish along with them, you will know that I am the god over all the lands.

(Judith 6:5) 
And you will prove that it is Holofernes who has the power to destroy you and all the mountainous land.

(Judith 6:6) 
And Holofernes commanded his servants, who were standing in his courtyard, to seize Achior and lead him to Bethulia, and to hand him over into the hands of the sons of Israel.

(Judith 6:7) 
And the servants of Holofernes, taking him, went through the plains. From the flatland, they ascended into the mountains and came to the springs that were below Bethulia.

(Judith 6:8) 
When they approached the city gates, they let Achior down, bound with ropes, and left him there. Then they returned to Holofernes.

(Judith 6:9) 
But the sons of Israel, coming down from their city, came to him. They untied him and brought him to Bethulia, presenting him in the midst of their people.

(Judith 6:10) 
And Ozias, the leader of the city, questioned him as to who he was, or from where he came, or why he had been left behind by the Assyrians.

(Judith 6:11) 
He responded, sitting in the midst of the leaders and all the people, and told them all the words of Holofernes' counsel. He recounted how he himself had spoken in the midst of the Assyrians and how Holofernes had commanded that, for this reason, he be handed over to the Israelites.

(Judith 6:12) 
And therefore, pray to the God of the universe to deign to send His judgment upon their army, for just as he reproached me, so also has he deigned to remember your disgrace.

(Judith 6:13) 
And all the people trembled when Achior spoke these words, and prostrating themselves on the ground, they adored the Lord, saying with one voice:

(Judith 6:14) 
Lord God of the universe and the earth, look upon their arrogance, and regard our humility. Turn your face against those who test you, and in those who hope in you, show your power.

(Judith 6:15) 
And now, brother, do not despair for your life, because we will take you in. Together we will die, or together we will live.

(Judith 6:16) 
Because you remembered us in the presence of Holofernes, and the Lord heard your words, therefore we also will do this good thing for you.

(Judith 6:17) 
And Ozias blessed him and promised to take him into Bethulia, so that those who wished to cast him out of the city would also be lacking in their purpose.

(Judith 6:18) 
And they brought him to the house of Ozias, who made a great feast for Achior. Ozias also called all the elders to the feast.

(Judith 6:19) 
And after this, all of them implored the Lord of Israel, that He would deign to deliver His people.

(Judith 6:20) 
And the next day, after all the army of strong men were gathered to help their wives and children and to preserve their cities, Ozias commanded all who lived in Bethulia, and all who lived in their land, to descend with all their animals to the water wells, and to consume the water, and he commanded that they conserve water for necessity.

(Judith 6:21) 
And he commanded all the women, and boys, and all the girls, and all the elderly, and all the young men, and all the infants to descend to the waters.

(Judith 6:22) 
And all gathered, men, and women, and boys, and all the elderly, and all the young people, and all the infants, and all the aged women, and all the children, to the waters.

(Judith 6:23) 
And all drank water until they were thirsty, and there was no water in the wells to satisfy them.

(Judith 6:24) 
And it came to pass that, after twenty days, the water in the cisterns failed. There was no water in the city for drinking for all the citizens, and women, and children, and men, and everyone who was in the city.

(Judith 6:25) 
And all in the city gathered—children, and women, and elders—to Ozias and to all the leaders of the city, and crying out, they said:

(Judith 6:26) 
May God judge between us and you, for you have made us die of hunger and thirst, and you have delivered us into the hands of the Assyrians.

(Judith 6:27) 
And now, why do you not surrender our city into the hands of the Assyrians, so that we may die, and not endure this punishment we now face: perpetual hunger, thirst, and death, because of all our iniquities? Why do we have to hear the cries of our wives, and our children, and our daughters, whom we see suffering from hunger, and thirst, and eternal death?

(Judith 6:28) 
And now, we know that there is no salvation for us. We seek to surrender, so that we may not die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful.

(Judith 6:29) 
For it is better for us to serve the Assyrians than to die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful, and not to hear the cries of our wives, and our children, and our daughters, whom we see suffering from hunger, and thirst, and eternal death.

(Judith 6:30) 
And now, we know that there is no salvation for us. We seek to surrender, so that we may not die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful.

(Judith 6:31) 
And now, we ask you to deign to give us five more days, so that in these days we may see if perhaps the Lord our God changes His plan and deigns to have mercy on us.

(Judith 6:32) 
For He will not entirely abandon His people. And if He wills it, He will not leave us to perish in the sight of all nations.

(Judith 6:33) 
And if He wills it, He will not leave us to perish in the sight of all nations, but will deign to deliver us.

(Judith 6:34) 
And Ozias said to them: "Believe me, we will not surrender you, unless by this time I have told you, if we do not see the help of our God, then we will do as you have said."

(Judith 6:35) 
And he swore to them, and all the people swore, and said: "Amen." (Meaning, 'So be it.')

(Judith 6:36) 
And all returned into the city, and there was no water for drinking for all the citizens, and women, and children, and men, and everyone who was in the city.

(Judith 6:37) 
And after this, all the people implored the Lord, that He would deign to have mercy on them, and that He would deign to deliver them.

(Judith 6:38) 
And all the people said: "Amen." (Meaning, 'So be it.')

(Judith 6:39) 
And it came to pass in those days that Judea was not without aid, and Bethulia was not without aid.

(Judith 6:40) 
And all the nations came to Bethulia, and to all the cities of Judea, and to all the cities of Samaria, and to all the cities of Galilee, and to all the cities of the region of the Philistines, and to all the cities of the region of the Ascalonites, and to all the cities of the region of the Azotians, and to all the cities of the region of the Accaronites, and to all the cities of the region of the Getthites, and to all the cities of the region of the Gadarenes, and to all the cities of the region of Samaria, and to all the cities of the region of Galilee.

(Judith 7:1) 
When the children of Israel heard that Holofernes had taken up positions throughout all the mountainous region where they lived, they went and dug cisterns all over the highest mountain.

(Judith 7:2) 
And the children of Israel went up to Mount Bethel, and to Besthom, and to Chobai, and to Aetnan, and to Salem, and to Theco, and to Abelmai, and to all the places where there were springs of water.

(Judith 7:3) 
Holofernes and his entire army then set up camp. Their troops were immensely large, numbering one hundred seventy thousand men and twelve thousand horsemen. There were also countless camels, donkeys, and mules with them, making it an incredibly vast multitude.

(Judith 7:4) 
They set up their camp across the wide valley near Bethulia, at the spring located in its field. Their forces stretched out across the plain, from Dothaim all the way to Gabee, extending eastward.

(Judith 7:5) 
However, the children of Israel lit fires in their watchtowers. They remained on guard all night, watching all around to protect themselves.

(Judith 7:6) 
Holofernes then approached their water spring with all his cavalry that was with him. He occupied it and placed his cavalry guards there, along with armed men from the Assyrian army.

(Judith 7:7) 
He then advanced against the children of Israel into the mountains. He went up to Bethulia and occupied all the entrances to the city.

(Judith 7:8) 
Near their aqueduct, he positioned a troop of twelve hundred cavalrymen, and with them, twenty thousand foot soldiers.

(Judith 7:9) 
They proceeded into the valley with all their might. They went up to the water source of Bethulia and seized all the water, including their spring, and remained there with their forces.

(Judith 7:10) 
Then the leader of the children of Ammon, Achior, approached Holofernes and said: "Listen, my lord, to a word from the mouth of your servant. I will speak the truth in your presence, and no lie will come from my mouth."

(Judith 7:11) 
"This people, who live in the mountains, are faithful to the living God. Therefore, it is impossible for them to be defeated by those who wish to attack them, unless they have turned away from their God."

(Judith 7:12) 
"For whenever they abandon Him, they are given over in battle to disgrace. And whenever they perform acts of repentance, strength to resist is given to them by the God of heaven."

(Judith 7:13) 
Holofernes said to Achior: "Who are you to prophesy to us today and say that we should not attack the people of Israel, just because their God defends them?"

(Judith 7:14) 
"And I will burn alive the one who sent you from your land, if you dare to retract even the smallest part of what you have said."

(Judith 7:15) 
"Do not think that I cannot resist your God more strongly. But when I know that your prophecies will not come true, then I will utterly destroy you."

(Judith 7:16) 
"And now, so you may know that every spirit overcomes every god, and all my power is stronger than all powers, do not lie to yourself by saying that I cannot conquer this people who live in the mountains."

(Judith 7:17) 
"Do not fear my presence, nor let your heart be crushed, if you have spoken this word to me."

(Judith 7:18) 
"But if you tell me that your God is stronger, why is it that you do not want me to bring Him to you and offer Him as my sacrifice?"

(Judith 7:19) 
Then he gave the order, and they brought Achior out of the camp. They led him to Bethulia and left him tied to a tree so that they might get all the truth from him, should he choose to announce it to his people.

(Judith 7:20) 
And they returned to Holofernes and reported to him everything they had done with Achior, including leaving him tied to a tree near Bethulia.

(Judith 7:21) 
Holofernes became inflamed with anger at Achior and said to him: "If you are not in this city, so that I may see the evil I will inflict on you, I will never worship you, nor do anything for you."

(Judith 7:22) 
"But if you go into the land you mentioned, worship me, and I will make you my son."

(Judith 7:23) 
And he commanded that those who had reported Achior to him should report everything Achior had done in the city.

(Judith 7:24) 
He sent word to every province of the Assyrians, commanding them to gather an army and march to Bethulia to capture it.

(Judith 7:25) 
And all were gathered, and they marched to Bethulia, and set up camp against it, besieging it for thirty days.

(Judith 7:26) 
During this time, their water and food supplies within the city began to run out.

(Judith 7:27) 
When the children of Israel saw that their water and food supplies were failing, and that many in the city were growing weak, and that whoever tried to drink from the waters was dying, they knew the situation was dire.

(Judith 7:28) 
Then all the women and men, young and old, boys and girls, gathered around Ozias and the leaders of the city and said:

(Judith 7:29) 
"May the Lord judge between us and you, because you have done us wrong! You were unwilling to speak with the Assyrians, preferring to hand us over into their hands for disgrace and death."

(Judith 7:30) 
"And now we are perishing from hunger and thirst. We can no longer resist them."

(Judith 7:31) 
"So now, gather the people and tell them to go out to Holofernes and surrender themselves into his hands. Do not allow us to die."

(Judith 7:32) 
Ozias said: "Listen, my brothers, I am also not pleased that we should surrender ourselves into the hands of our enemies. But I cannot do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 7:33) 
"But if you are willing to wait five days, until the Lord our God has mercy on us and sends us help: then, if He does not have mercy on us and does not send us help, we will do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 7:34) 
And Ozias said: "I know that this is the reason why our God is troubling you: to test you, to see if you are worthy of your God."

(Judith 7:35) 
"But do not lose heart in this time of tribulation. Instead, hope in God, so that His mercy may reach you."

(Judith 7:36) 
"And if you wish that we hope in Him for five days, and if He does not have mercy on us and does not send us help, we will do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 7:37) 
And all the people said: "We will do with you what you have said, but let us not die on the way!"

(Judith 7:38) 
Ozias and the leaders of the city swore an oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 7:39) 
And all the people swore an oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 7:40) 
Ozias and the leaders of the city then swore another oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."

(Judith 8:1) 
Now, Judith, a widow, heard all these things. She was the daughter of Merari. Merari was the son of Ox, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Oziel, who was the son of Elchia, who was the son of Anania, who was the son of Gedeon, who was the son of Raphaim, who was the son of Achitob, who was the son of Melchia, who was the son of Enan, who was the son of Nathania, who was the son of Salathiel, who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Ruben.

(Judith 8:2) 
And her husband, Manasses, had died during the days of the barley harvest.

(Judith 8:3) 
He had been binding bundles of grain in the field, when intense heat overcame him. He died in his bed and was buried with his ancestors in Bethulia.

(Judith 8:4) 
Now, Judith had been his widow for three years and six months.

(Judith 8:5) 
She had made a private tent for herself on the roof of her house, and she lived there in seclusion with her maids.

(Judith 8:6) 
She wore sackcloth around her waist and the garments of a widow. She fasted every day of her life, except on Sabbaths, New Moon days, and the feast days of the house of Israel.

(Judith 8:7) 
She was very beautiful to look at, and a most honorable woman. Indeed, her husband Manasses had left her a house, a very good fortune, fields, and harvests of grain, as well as oxen and sheep.

(Judith 8:8) 
And the widow carefully managed all these things, so that no one could find fault with her in any way.

(Judith 8:9) 
Everyone praised her highly, because she feared the Lord. So much so that there was no one who spoke any evil word about her.

(Judith 8:10) 
But when Judith heard that Holofernes was pressing against the city, she refused to leave her house, nor would she abandon the privacy of her tent.

(Judith 8:11) 
And all these things were being spoken among the people, just as Ozias had said. All the water had now failed, and the city was in great distress. There was nothing left among them to refresh themselves or to quench their thirst.

(Judith 8:12) 
And all the men, women, and children gathered before Ozias and all the leaders of the city, saying to them all:

(Judith 8:13) 
“May God be merciful to you, and grant us peace.”

(Judith 8:14) 
“Because we have now completely failed, and every one of our people is dying from thirst.”

(Judith 8:15) 
“So now, gather all the men who are in the city, so that we may attack all our adversaries. If we can, we will kill them; if not, we ourselves will die. Let us not see our wives and our children dying before our eyes.”

(Judith 8:16) 
“We implore you, by our God, to do for us as we have said.”

(Judith 8:17) 
And Ozias said to them: “Brothers, be of good courage, and bear with us for five more days, during which we will wait for mercy from the Lord.”

(Judith 8:18) 
“For the Lord does not forsake us to such an extent that if these days pass and no help comes to us, I will act according to your word.”

(Judith 8:19) 
And when he had said these things, they dismissed the people, each one to his camp. And they set guards over the walls and towers of their city.

(Judith 8:20) 
And they sent everyone to his post. And when Judith had heard all these things, she sent her maid to call Ozias, and Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of the city.

(Judith 8:21) 
And they came to her, and she said to them: “What is this word, to which you have agreed, that you would surrender our city to the Assyrians if help does not come to you within five days?”

(Judith 8:22) 
“And who are you, that you put the Lord to the test?”

(Judith 8:23) 
“This is not a word that strengthens the hearts of men and gives spirit, but rather one that provokes to anger and ignites fury.”

(Judith 8:24) 
“You have set a time limit for the Lord yourselves, and you have appointed a day for Him according to your own will.”

(Judith 8:25) 
“But because the Lord is most patient, He therefore reproves you and shows you an example of His wrath, in which you do not know what He will do to you.”

(Judith 8:26) 
“But we now know that we have sold ourselves, to be handed over into the hands of our enemies, because there is no helper for us from among you.”

(Judith 8:27) 
“But you, my brothers, do not test the Lord our God.”

(Judith 8:28) 
“For if it does not please Him to help us within five days, He has the power, in whatever way and on whatever days He wishes, to deliver us or to strike us down in the sight of our enemies.”

(Judith 8:29) 
“But do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God, because God is not like man, nor is the Son of Man like the son of man in wisdom or power.”

(Judith 8:30) 
“Therefore, since we await patience and consolation from Him, do not be angry against Him, but humble yourselves under His hand.”

(Judith 8:31) 
“For if He does not choose to help us within five days, and if He Himself wills it at a time when He chooses, nevertheless we will pray to Him that He may deliver us.”

(Judith 8:32) 
“But also, you, Judith, do not test God. For all these things are the works of God.”

(Judith 8:33) 
And when Ozias had said these things, Judith said to him: “What I have said to you, I have not spoken as a human, but I speak to you according to God.”

(Judith 8:34) 
“For if you truly test Him, and He does not wish to help you within these five days, as you desire, you will not be able to escape His hand.”

(Judith 8:35) 
“And the entire house of Israel will perish because of your decisions.”

(Judith 8:36) 
“Or who are you, who tempt the Lord, and there is no sense in you?”

(Judith 8:37) 
“Now, however, you see how we are dying, and our entire people are dying, while there is no one who can help us.”

(Judith 8:38) 
“And behold, if there is no help, and it does not befall us, this situation will be before the Lord, so that He may hear our prayers.”

(Judith 8:39) 
“And now, brothers, because you are the leaders of the people, and their hearts and courage depend on you:”

(Judith 8:40) 
“And now, if my word is on your lips and you follow it, no effort will be futile, and your help will certainly be at hand.”

(Judith 9:1) 
Judith then cried out to the Lord, saying:

(Judith 9:2) 
My Lord God, hear me, your handmaiden, and look upon my work—my mission to save Israel—because Holofernes has arrogantly thought to challenge your power, and the honor of your holy temple, and against your altar, which you yourself established.

(Judith 9:3) 
For he openly declared that he would defile and destroy your temple and your altar by his own might.

(Judith 9:4) 
Look now: the Assyrians have multiplied their forces and their power. They boast in their horses and cavalry, in the strength of their foot soldiers, and in their shields, lances, arrows, and slings.

(Judith 9:5) 
And they do not know that you are the God of all creation, who crushes wars from the beginning of time—and Lord is your very Name.

(Judith 9:6) 
Lift up your arm as you have done from the very beginning of Israel's history, and crush their power with your might. Then their strength will fall into complete ruin.

(Judith 9:7) 
Because Holofernes declared, 'My generation will not remember their existence'—meaning he intends to wipe out Israel completely—'and I will destroy their land.'

(Judith 9:8) 
But you, Lord God, do not overlook your power in the things I am about to do, but make what I have said come true, and guide my purpose to its completion.

(Judith 9:9) 
For your power is not found in numbers, nor does your strength reside in the mighty. Instead, you are the Protector of the humble and the meek.

(Judith 9:10) 
You are the helper of orphans, and the supporter of the lowly, and the champion of the weak, and the Protector of those who are without hope, and the Savior of all who hope in you.

(Judith 9:11) 
Remember, Lord, your covenant and your oath which you swore to Isaac, and your promise that you made to Jacob, to multiply their descendants.

(Judith 9:12) 
For from the beginning of time, you were not one who needed our created beings, but you are the one who works your power within us because of who you are.

(Judith 9:13) 
And now, Lord, look: the Assyrians are puffed up in their own strength, and they are exalted in their horses and cavalry. They boast in the might of their foot soldiers.

(Judith 9:14) 
They despise you, and they threaten your holy places, and the glory of your Name. Cast down their strength with your own might, and crush their power with your divine fury, because they say, 'There is no one who can resist me!' Be my helper, Lord my God, and hear my prayer. And grant me words and clever deceit upon my lips, so that I may deceive them. For my strength comes from your power, and my heart will be exalted in your might. Because through my words you will deceive them, and through the appearance of my face you will cast them down. And every nation will know that you are God, who crushes the powerful by your might. Amen.

(Judith 9:1) 
On that specific day, Judith fell to the ground on her face, put ashes on her head, and covered herself with sackcloth. And at the very hour when the daily incense was offered in Jerusalem in the Temple of the Lord, Judith fell prostrate to the ground and opened her mouth to the Lord, praying:

(Judith 9:2) 
"Lord, God of my father Simeon, You gave him a sword to defend against the foreigners who, driven by lust, violated the private parts of women, shamelessly exposed them, stained blood in their anger, and acted against natural law."

(Judith 9:3) 
"And You said that such acts should not be. Yet they allowed their own sons to expose themselves with them in these acts. So You brought their leaders to utter destruction, and their beds, which were defiled by lust, became a snare for them."

(Judith 9:4) 
"And You struck down their men along with their women, and their sons with their daughters, bringing about their ruin. And now, Lord, I beg You to help me, Your handmaid, who trusts in You, and I trust in You alone; I have nothing else in my life."

(Judith 9:5) 
"For You have called forth the past, and those things that happened afterward, and those things that exist now, and all things yet to come; You made them all into one unified plan. And the events that unfold, You caused them, and Your judgments are already prepared and certain."

(Judith 9:6) 
"Because of this, Lord, You who have prepared all things, and whose judgments are in all things, look now upon this plea, to which I attach myself entirely to You, and I direct my supplication to You."

(Judith 9:7) 
"For the army of the Assyrians has grown vast, and their pride has multiplied. No one worries about their sword, their army, or their men, but in Your Name, I pray that through me, Your handmaid, You will destroy those who believe they have something they can use to oppose You."

(Judith 9:8) 
"For You are the Almighty God, and You alone are God, and there is no other who can stand against You."

(Judith 9:9) 
"And look now upon the camp of the Assyrians, just as You deigned to look upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued the children of Israel with their chariots and a multitude of warriors."

(Judith 9:10) 
"You covered their legions with the sea, and the sea drowned them, and their name has been extinguished even to this very day."

(Judith 9:11) 
"Do the same for this army, Lord, and cast down their entire military force."

(Judith 9:12) 
"And by the hand of Your maidservant, may I become a refuge for my people, and may their pride be broken, and their destruction brought upon them, and all who are proud in Your Name."

(Judith 9:13) 
"And may all nations know that You are God, and there is no other besides You."

(Judith 9:14) 
And Judith cried out with a loud voice to the Lord, saying: "God of Israel, hear me, Your handmaid."

(Judith 9:1) 
Then Judith prayed: "O Lord, O Lord, God of my father Simeon, you gave a sword into his hand for vengeance against foreigners, who had provoked his zeal to anger, who had committed incest in their seed, and had defiled the side of Thamar, and had defiled him who bore them.

(Judith 9:2) 
And you gave their wives over to plunder, and their daughters into captivity, and you divided all their spoil among your sons, who were inflamed with zeal for you and with horror at their fornication. You have helped me, a sinful woman, O Lord my God, to take vengeance against those who did these things.

(Judith 9:3) 
For behold, the Assyrians have boasted in their own strength, and in their horses and horsemen, in the power of their foot soldiers, and in the confidence of their shields, and in the trust they place in their own defenses, and in their arrows, and in their catapults, and in all kinds of weapons.

(Judith 9:4) 
And they said: 'We will go up to the farthest parts of the earth, and we will inherit the desolate places and the entire land, and we will capture all the nations that are in it, and all the peoples who dwell there, and the entire land.'

(Judith 9:5) 
Now therefore, O Lord God of heaven and earth, creator of the waters, and King of every creature, hear my prayers.

(Judith 9:6) 
And make their counsel come to naught, so that they may know that you are the Almighty God, and there is no other besides you who fights for Israel.

(Judith 9:7) 
And by your power, put their arrogance to confusion, and by my sword, confuse them.

(Judith 9:8) 
For your strength is not in a multitude of men, nor is your might in the number of foot soldiers, but in the simplicity of your prayer, and in the strength of your heart; you alone are God, and you can deliver your people.

(Judith 9:9) 
And make their counsel come to naught, so that they may know that you are the Almighty God, and there is no other besides you who fights for Israel.

(Judith 9:10) 
And by your power, put their arrogance to confusion, and by my sword, confuse them.

(Judith 9:11) 
For your strength is not in a multitude of men, nor is your might in the number of foot soldiers, but in the simplicity of your prayer, and in the strength of your heart; you alone are God, and you can deliver your people.

(Judith 9:12) 
And Judith said: 'Amen.' And she fell upon her face to the ground, and adored God, and said: 'Amen, amen, amen.'

(Judith 9:13) 
And Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 9:14) 
And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 9:15) 
And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 9:16) 
And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 9:17) 
And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 9:18) 
And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'

(Judith 10:1) 
After these things, when the crying and the mourning had stopped throughout the city,

(Judith 10:2) 
Judith rose up in the middle of the night and called her personal maidservant, who was in charge of all her affairs.

(Judith 10:3) 
And she took a small bottle of fine olive oil and anointed herself with the very best perfume. She carefully styled her hair and then placed a decorative headdress over it, adorning herself with her most joyful and festive clothing.

(Judith 10:4) 
She put her sandals on her feet, and arranged all her jewelry: her bracelets, her bangles, her rings, her earrings, and every other adornment she possessed.

(Judith 10:5) 
She was exceedingly beautiful in appearance, designed to captivate and deceive the eyes of all the men who would gaze upon her.

(Judith 10:6) 
And she instructed her maidservant to take all the vessels containing her carefully prepared bread, and her wine, and her water jar, and her pulverized, cooked food. She had set aside all her provisions, which she had sanctified for herself and for her mission, and she loaded them onto the maidservant to carry.

(Judith 10:7) 
And they both went out of the city together, so they could travel to the camp of the Assyrians.

(Judith 10:8) 
And when they reached the city gates, Uzziah, and the elders of the city, Chabris and Charmis, met them there.

(Judith 10:9) 
And when they saw her, they were struck with profound astonishment, and they were utterly overwhelmed by her beauty.

(Judith 10:10) 
Nevertheless, because they understood her true intention and the mission she was undertaking, they encouraged her, and said: "May the Lord go with you in His divine strength, and may the Lord accomplish everything you have in your heart and mind to do, so that there may be glory for the children of Israel, and exaltation for Jerusalem."

(Judith 10:11) 
And Judith, adoring the Lord, responded: "Amen, amen."

(Judith 10:12) 
And she remained in that same place for a moment, keeping her head veiled as was customary for prayer, and she prayed to the Lord.

(Judith 10:13) 
And she set out with her maidservant, traveling through the mountain area, where there was a spring of fresh water.

(Judith 10:14) 
And they arrived at the Assyrian outposts, where the guards immediately met them.

(Judith 10:15) 
And seizing her, the guards began to question her: "Tell us, where are you from? And where are you coming from right now? Or where are you going?"

(Judith 10:16) 
And she said to them: "I am from the daughters of Canaan—meaning, a Gentile woman from outside Israel—and I am fleeing from a terrible fate, for I know that my people are about to become your prey."

(Judith 10:17) 
And when she had been brought to the outpost where the commanders were stationed, they said, "Take her and lead her to Holofernes immediately."

(Judith 10:18) 
And so they came, and they arrived at Holofernes' personal tent.

(Judith 10:19) 
And they led her directly to Holofernes, and she stood before his presence.

(Judith 10:20) 
And Judith managed to speak with Holofernes inside his tent.

(Judith 10:21) 
And Holofernes questioned her, saying: "Tell me, from what people are you? And from where do you come?"

(Judith 10:22) 
And Judith said: "I am from the daughters of Israel, and I am fleeing from them, because they are about to become your prey."

(Judith 10:23) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:24) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am truly one of your servants, and during my stay, no harm will come to me at your hand."

(Judith 10:25) 
And Holofernes replied again: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:26) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, please listen to my words, and no harm will come to you during my days here."

(Judith 10:27) 
And Holofernes repeated: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:28) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, listen to my words, and no harm will come to you during my days here."

(Judith 10:29) 
And Holofernes said again: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:30) 
And Holofernes then asked: "From where do you know, that they are destined to become prey?"

(Judith 10:31) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."

(Judith 10:32) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:33) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."

(Judith 10:34) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:35) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."

(Judith 10:36) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:37) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."

(Judith 10:38) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 10:39) 
And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."

(Judith 10:40) 
And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."

(Judith 11:1) 
Then Holofernes said to her: "Be comforted, woman, and do not fear in your heart. For I have never harmed anyone who truly wanted to serve King Nabuchodonosor."

(Judith 11:2) 
"If your people's army had not disrespected me, I would not have raised my hand against them."

(Judith 11:3) 
"Now therefore, tell me, for what reason did you flee from them and come to us?"

(Judith 11:4) 
And Judith said to him: "Listen to the words of your servant, because if you heed my words, the Lord will accomplish with you a deed that He will never abandon, so that He may bring His judgment upon this people through you."

(Judith 11:5) 
"For as King Nabuchodonosor, the ruler of the earth, lives, and as his power lives — that power which resides in you for the punishment of every living soul — not only do men serve him, but even the wild beasts of the field obey him."

(Judith 11:6) 
"Indeed, the strength of your spirit must also be proclaimed to us, master. For this is announced throughout all nations: that you alone are truly good in his entire kingdom, mighty in power, and unique in counsel."

(Judith 11:7) 
"And let no one despise your words. Rather, whoever would abandon you would not possess the glory of their own name."

(Judith 11:8) 
"For let the truth be known to King Nabuchodonosor and his power: that the entire land serves your might."

(Judith 11:9) 
"Indeed, what I have heard about you and about your prudent wisdom should not be diminished by anyone throughout the entire land."

(Judith 11:10) 
"Because you alone are truly good in the entire kingdom, mighty in power, and admirable in counsel."

(Judith 11:11) 
"But let me not speak in vain. What your servant has spoken to your face is true, because your servant, a mere woman, has learned from the God of Israel that God will hand them over into your power."

(Judith 11:12) 
"Because they have sinned against the Lord their God, and there is no one among them who can defend them, unless it is to turn away His wrath from themselves."

(Judith 11:13) 
"Now therefore, my master, let this word come to your hearing: if there is any falsehood or sin within that city, behold, I will tell you, and I will not lie to your face."

(Judith 11:14) 
"And in all these things that I have said, your servant will not lie, nor will she be false."

(Judith 11:15) 
"But if you are indeed inclined to do what is true and just, and do not abandon those principles, I will never abandon you throughout all the days and nights and years of your life, for as long as my strength endures."

(Judith 11:16) 
"And we will go out at night through the gate into the valley, and I will walk in the valley all through the night. Then I will come to you in the daytime and announce to you in what specific way they have sinned against my God."

(Judith 11:17) 
"And you will know that the Lord will guide me from among Israel, in what I see and hear and in all my work. And the Lord will know that there is nothing in this city that truly belongs to these people, except for their own lives—meaning no divine protection remains for them."

(Judith 11:18) 
"And I will return to you again on that day and tell you how they will transgress all the precepts that God has commanded them, that they should not eat from the grain, or the wine, or the oil."

(Judith 11:19) 
"And they will do these things out of great necessity, to obtain all these supplies. They will be compelled to eat them and begin to sin against their God. Then a message will come to you, and I will personally announce to you how they will transgress all the precepts that God has commanded them, concerning not eating from the grain, or the wine, or the oil."

(Judith 11:20) 
"And in all these matters, I will announce everything to you and hand them over to you—and all the province of Judea, and the very middle of Jerusalem."

(Judith 11:21) 
And Holofernes said to her: "May the Lord your God bless you, because He sends you to us, so that our power may be glorified among all who inhabit the land."

(Judith 11:22) 
"And woman, your speech is good, and there is no one in the land who can compare with you."

(Judith 11:23) 
"Indeed, your strength and the wisdom of your heart are wonderful, in that you have come to us and related these things."

(Judith 11:1) 
Holofernes spoke to her, saying, “Take courage and do not be afraid in your heart. I have never harmed any man who willingly served Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth.”

(Judith 11:2) 
“If your people had not shown contempt for my god,” he continued, “I would not have raised my spear against them. But they themselves have brought these consequences upon themselves.”

(Judith 11:3) 
“Now, tell me: from where have you fled from them, and why have you come to us? You are meant to be safe. Therefore, take courage and live through this night and hereafter.”

(Judith 11:4) 
“Indeed, no one will harm you. Instead, everyone will treat you well, just as they treat my own servants.”

(Judith 11:5) 
Judith replied to him, “Receive the words of your handmaid. For if you follow the counsel of your servant, the Lord will bring this matter to a perfect conclusion through you, and He will not frustrate your plans.”

(Judith 11:6) 
“As surely as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the earth, lives, and as truly as his power—which resides in you for the chastisement of every living soul—is real: not only do people serve him through you, but even the wild beasts of the field are subjected to him through your command.”

(Judith 11:7) 
“Rather, the ancient traditions of Assyria are now fulfilled through your might, confirming the power of your god. No one who wanders from his path will escape.”

(Judith 11:8) 
“For we have heard of your wisdom and your prudence. It has been reported throughout all the land that you alone are truly excellent in all the king's dominion, powerful in every military discipline.”

(Judith 11:9) 
“And it is no wonder that you alone are so excellent, since you serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth, and he himself has sent you to bring order and reform to the entire world.”

(Judith 11:10) 
“For this also, which we have heard, we speak of: it has been proven true that the Jewish people do not eat blood, nor an animal that has been strangled, nor anything unclean. Indeed, they have abstained from these foods for a very long time.”

(Judith 11:11) 
“Therefore, I, your handmaid, pondering all these things, said within myself: 'I will go to my lord Holofernes and reveal to him all their secrets. I will show him by what means he can capture them all, without any detriment to his army.'”

(Judith 11:12) 
“For they have rebelled against you, and they are full of iniquities, and the wrath of my Lord has been provoked against them.”

(Judith 11:13) 
“Furthermore, because their food supplies have failed them and all their water has now run out, they have decided to attack their livestock. And what they are not permitted to eat, they have now resolved to consume: they have determined to eat blood, and animals that have been strangled, and other unclean things.”

(Judith 11:14) 
“They have even sent word to Jerusalem—because the inhabitants there have committed these very transgressions—for them to bring all the consecrated fruits, wine, and oil from the land. They have arranged to bring these provisions to a ritually clean place and consume them there.”

(Judith 11:15) 
“And knowing these things, I know that when they begin to do these forbidden acts, they will be given into your hands for utter destruction. You will not need to engage in battle, but without a single fight, I will lead you to bring the entire multitude to your feet.”

(Judith 11:16) 
“And I, your handmaid, knowing all this, fled from them. The Lord has sent me to report these very things to you.”

(Judith 11:17) 
“And your handmaid worships God day and night. I will go out into the valley and pray to the Lord, and He will tell me when they commit these specific sins.”

(Judith 11:18) 
“Then, upon returning, I will inform you, and at that time you shall advance with your entire army, and there will be no one able to resist you.”

(Judith 11:19) 
Holofernes listened to her words with joy, and his servants were astonished by her wisdom. They spoke among themselves, saying:

(Judith 11:20) 
“There is no such woman upon the earth, from one end to the other, in both beauty and wisdom.”

(Judith 11:21) 
Then Holofernes said to her, “God has done well to send you ahead of your people, so that victory might be delivered into our hands through you.”

(Judith 11:22) 
“And because your words are excellent, and your face is beautiful, you shall be safe in my household. You will never lack bread or wine.”

(Judith 11:23) 
“Instead, you shall remain here with me, and no one will harm you. They will treat you just as they treat my own servants.”

(Judith 11:24) 
Judith replied to him, “I cannot eat from the provisions you have commanded to be given to me, lest I commit an offense against God and transgress His law.”

(Judith 11:25) 
“Instead, I will eat from the provisions I have brought with me. Or, if you truly wish for me to suffer deprivation, then I will eat from your supplies.”

(Judith 11:26) 
Holofernes then asked her, “What if the provisions you have brought with you run out while you are staying with us?”

(Judith 11:27) 
“For the journey is long, and for a long time, you will not be able to return to your city.”

(Judith 11:28) 
Judith replied, “As your soul lives, my lord, I will not consume all the provisions I have brought with me, until the Lord accomplishes through my hand the purpose I have set out to achieve.”

(Judith 11:29) 
Then Holofernes’ servants led her into her tent, and she rested there.

(Judith 11:30) 
And she rose early, before dawn, and commanded her handmaid to prepare her ritually pure food, as she was accustomed to do.

(Judith 11:31) 
And she went out into the valley with her handmaid and bathed herself in the fountain of water.

(Judith 11:32) 
And when she had finished bathing and risen, she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, that He would direct her path toward the deliverance of her people.

(Judith 11:33) 
Then she returned and remained ritually pure in her tent, eating her own provisions, until the fourth day.

(Judith 11:34) 
And on the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. He invited none of his officers, only those who were with him in his personal tent.

(Judith 11:35) 
And he said to Bagao, the eunuch who was in charge of all his affairs, “Go and persuade that Hebrew woman to willingly agree to stay with me, so that she may eat and drink with us.”

(Judith 11:36) 
“For it is a disgrace for us if we allow such a woman to leave without having had her company. Indeed, if we cannot sway her, she will mock us.”

(Judith 11:37) 
Then Bagao went in to Judith and said, “Let my lady not be afraid to enter my lord's presence, so that she may be honored before him and eat and drink with him, and be merry. For this day will be like a feast day for you.”

(Judith 11:38) 
Judith replied to him, “Who am I to contradict my lord? I will do everything that pleases him, and whatever is good in his sight.”

(Judith 11:39) 
Judith arose and dressed herself in her finest garments, putting on all her feminine adornments. Her handmaid went before her and spread the beautiful veil, which Judith had acquired from Bagao on the day she was received, before Holofernes. Holofernes himself was sitting upon his splendid cushion, fashioned from purple fabric, gold, emeralds, and other precious stones.

(Judith 11:40) 
And when Judith entered, Holofernes’ heart was deeply stirred by her appearance. He was filled with an overwhelming desire to lie with her, for he had never seen such a woman in all his life.

(Judith 11:1) 
So Achior said to him: 'Hear, my lord, a true word from the mouth of your servant. I will tell you the truth about this people who live as neighbors to you and inhabit these mountains. I will not speak a lie in your presence.'

(Judith 11:2) 
This people descended from the Chaldeans —meaning, their ancestor Abraham was called out of Ur of the Chaldeans by God.

(Judith 11:3) 
When they first came into Mesopotamia, they stayed there for a time, because they refused to follow the idolatrous gods of their ancestors who were in the land of the Chaldeans.

(Judith 11:4) 
They turned away from the ways of their idolatrous fathers and worshipped the one true God of the universe, the God whom they truly knew.

(Judith 11:5) 
Because of this, others cast them out from the presence of their gods. So, they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.

(Judith 11:6) 
From there, they migrated to the land of Canaan and lived upon it. They grew rich with gold and silver and an exceedingly immense number of livestock.

(Judith 11:7) 
Later, when they went down into Egypt and were oppressed by King Pharaoh, they cried out to their God. In response, He struck the entire land of Egypt with various plagues.

(Judith 11:8) 
And God cast them out of the land of Egypt and made a clear separation between them and the Egyptians —at the Red Sea.

(Judith 11:9) 
He dried up the Red Sea before them and led them on a path through the desert of Kadesh-Barnea, even to the farthest known parts of the world.

(Judith 11:10) 
They lived in the land of the Amorites beyond the Jordan in the desert, stretching as far as Edom, and on Mount Gilead, and throughout all the land of Goshen, even to those distant regions.

(Judith 11:11) 
But after they sinned in the sight of their God, and they departed from His ways, acting like many other nations do, He cast them away from His presence and delivered them to be plundered by their enemies.

(Judith 11:12) 
They were led away into Babylonia, where they remained for many years in exile.

(Judith 11:13) 
Afterwards, they returned to their God, and He brought them back from Babylonia and restored them to their own land, and they possessed it once again.

(Judith 11:14) 
And now they themselves live in these mountains, and they have many cities and villages within them.

(Judith 11:15) 
Furthermore, because they have not sinned in the sight of their God according to the customs of the other nations you have seen, even if they have not sinned and have not acted against their God as other peoples do— therefore, if they have not sinned, nor are they without His protection, your power cannot harm them.

(Judith 11:16) 
But if they have sinned in the sight of their God, then you can subdue them for yourself.

(Judith 11:17) 
And so that you may know that what I say is true, consider that when they have not been sinners in the sight of their God, they have not been an obstacle to you, but rather they have been victorious in battle and in slaughter.

(Judith 11:18) 
Therefore, my lord, O king, and mighty ruler of the earth: if there is any iniquity in this people in the sight of their God, then destroy them, so that I may advance, pursue, and conquer them.

(Judith 11:19) 
However, if there is no offense in this people, then beware lest you resist against their God, lest you bring ruin upon yourself. For their God is their protector, and He it is who shelters them.

(Judith 11:20) 
And it happened that when Achior had finished speaking these words, Holofernes became very angry with Achior and said to him: 'Who are you, Achior, that you dare to prophesy to us as if you were the God of Israel?'

(Judith 11:21) 
'But because you told us that if the people of Israel have sinned, we can conquer them— now then, so that you may know that what you have said is false, I myself will deliver you into their hands!'

(Judith 11:22) 
'And you will see that you yourself will not be able to escape death; instead, you must die in their presence!'

(Judith 11:23) 
'And when we have taken them captive, or captured their land, then you, so that you may know that you are their God, will die with them!'

(Judith 12:1) 
So Holofernes gave orders that Judith should be brought to the place where Holofernes’ personal silverware was stored. He set out some of his own food for her to eat and some of his own wine for her to drink.

(Judith 12:2) 
But Judith said, 'I will not eat any of these things, lest I commit an offense. Instead, I will eat only from the food that I brought with me.'

(Judith 12:3) 
Holofernes asked her, 'If the provisions you brought run out, where will we find more food like them for you? For there is no one from your own people living among us here.'

(Judith 12:4) 
Judith answered him, 'As the Lord lives, my food will not run out during this journey I have undertaken, until the Lord accomplishes through me what I have planned to do.'

(Judith 12:5) 
So Holofernes’ servants brought her into her own tent, and she slept until midnight. She arose a short while before the first dawn.

(Judith 12:6) 
Then she sent a message to Holofernes, saying, 'My lord, please give orders that your servant be permitted to go out for prayer, and from there I will take my food and drink.'

(Judith 12:7) 
Holofernes therefore gave orders that they should not stop her. So she stayed in the camp for three days, and each night she would go out into the valley of Bethulia and bathe herself in the spring of water that was within the camp.

(Judith 12:8) 
And as she returned from bathing, she would pray to the Lord God of Israel that He would direct her path towards the liberation of His people.

(Judith 12:9) 
After returning purified, she would remain in her tent each day, until the hour came for her to eat her food.

(Judith 12:10) 
On the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. Then he said to Bagoas, his eunuch, 'Go and persuade that Jewess to come willingly to eat and drink with us.'

(Judith 12:11) 
He continued, 'For it would be shameful if so great a woman were to scorn a man by refusing to speak with him. If we do not invite her, she will surely mock us.'

(Judith 12:12) 
So Bagoas went from Holofernes' presence and entered Judith’s tent. He said, 'Do not hesitate, my good lady, to come before our master, so that you may be honored in his presence and drink wine with us in merriment.'

(Judith 12:13) 
Judith answered him, 'Who am I to contradict my master? Whatever is pleasing in his sight, I will do it quickly.'

(Judith 12:14) 
And rising, she adorned herself with her finest garments and all her feminine ornaments. Her maidservant went ahead of her to show Holofernes how he should receive her as she entered his presence.

(Judith 12:15) 
When Judith entered and reclined at the table, Holofernes was deeply troubled in his spirit and stirred with strong desire. He became exceedingly lustful for her, coveting her from the very first moment he saw her.

(Judith 12:16) 
Then Holofernes said to her, 'Drink, and be merry with us!'

(Judith 12:17) 
Judith replied, 'I will drink, my lord, for my spirit is exalted this day above all my previous days.'

(Judith 12:18) 
And she took the food and drink her maidservant had prepared for her, and she ate and drank in his presence.

(Judith 12:19) 
Holofernes was greatly delighted with her, and he drank an excessive amount of wine, more than he had ever drunk in his entire life.

(Judith 12:1) 
Then Holofernes commanded that Judith be led to the place where his treasures were kept, and he also ordered that she should eat his own food and drink his own wine.

(Judith 12:2) 
And Judith answered him: "I will not eat any of these things, so that I may not commit a sin against God. Instead, I will eat from the provisions that I brought with me from Judea."

(Judith 12:3) 
Holofernes then said to her: "If these provisions that you brought with you run out, what will we do for you then?"

(Judith 12:4) 
Judith replied: "As your soul lives, my lord, your handmaid will not use up all of these provisions until God accomplishes through me what I have planned." After she said this, Holofernes's servants spoke to her about this matter throughout the night.

(Judith 12:5) 
Then Judith went into her own private chamber.

(Judith 12:6) 
She stayed in the camp for three days. During the nights, she would go out into the valley of Bethulia and wash herself at a spring of water located within the camp.

(Judith 12:7) 
And when she returned, she would pray to the Lord, the God of Israel, asking Him to direct her path for the liberation of His people.

(Judith 12:8) 
She would re-enter her chamber in a state of ritual cleanliness and would remain there until she ate her meal in the evening.

(Judith 12:9) 
On the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. He then said to Bagoas, his chief eunuch: "Go and persuade that Hebrew woman to come of her own free will and eat and drink with me."

(Judith 12:10) 
For Holofernes believed it would be shameful for him to have such a woman in his camp and not enjoy her company. In fact, he thought that if he did not invite her, he would be ridiculed by the Hebrews themselves.

(Judith 12:11) 
So Bagoas went to Judith and said: "Do not be afraid, good lady, to come to my lord. You will be honored in his presence, and you will eat with him and drink wine with joy."

(Judith 12:12) 
And Judith responded: "Who am I to contradict my lord? Whatever is pleasing in his eyes, I will do immediately. This will be a joy for me until the day of my death."

(Judith 12:13) 
So she rose and adorned herself in her finest garments. Then she entered and stood before Holofernes.

(Judith 12:14) 
Holofernes had her brought onto his couch and said to her: "Drink now, and feast with me, and enjoy yourself."

(Judith 12:15) 
Judith replied: "I will drink, my lord, because my spirit has been lifted this day more than on any previous day of my life."

(Judith 12:16) 
And she took the food and ate and drank before him from what her maidservant had prepared for her.

(Judith 12:17) 
Holofernes was greatly pleased with her, and he drank an excessive amount of wine, more than he had ever drunk in his entire life.

(Judith 12:18) 
When evening arrived, each of his servants got up and hurried to their quarters. Then Bagoas closed the doors of the bedroom and left.

(Judith 12:19) 
Everyone was exhausted from the feast, especially Holofernes. Only Judith remained alone in the bedroom with him.

(Judith 12:20) 
When Holofernes was heavily intoxicated with wine, he lay down on his bed.

(Judith 12:21) 
Judith sent word to her maidservant to stand outside the bedroom and wait until she came out, as she usually did for her prayers.

(Judith 12:22) 
Judith had previously told Bagoas that she would go out for her prayers, and he had been informed.

(Judith 12:23) 
After everyone had left and there was no one present, from the most trusted to the least important servant, Judith stood by Holofernes's head, praying with tears and moving her lips in silence.

(Judith 12:24) 
And she said: "Strengthen me, Lord God of Israel, and look upon the work of my hands. Grant that I may accomplish what you have promised, just as you promised."

(Judith 12:25) 
Then she drew out Holofernes's sword, which was lying beneath his pillow.

(Judith 12:26) 
And grasping the hair of his head, she said: "Strengthen me, Lord God, in this very hour."

(Judith 12:27) 
And she struck him twice on his neck, severing his head. She completely separated his body from his head and then concealed the head beneath his mosquito netting, which covered his bed.

(Judith 12:28) 
She then went out and handed Holofernes's head to her maidservant, instructing her to put it into her provision basket.

(Judith 12:29) 
Then both of them left the tent according to their usual routine, as if going out for prayer. They passed through the camp, circled the valley, and finally arrived at the gate of the city of Bethulia.

(Judith 12:30) 
From a distance, Judith called out to the guards on the walls: "Open the gates, for God is with us, He who has shown great strength in Israel!"

(Judith 12:31) 
When the people heard her voice, they rushed to the city gates and summoned the elders of the city.

(Judith 12:32) 
Everyone gathered, from the least to the greatest, because they had given up hope that she would ever return.

(Judith 12:33) 
And lighting their lamps, they opened the gates for them. They welcomed Judith and her maidservant, and a great light of joy shone forth.

(Judith 12:34) 
Then Judith said to them: "Praise the Lord our God, who has not abandoned those who hope in Him!"

(Judith 12:35) 
And through me, His handmaid, He has fulfilled His mercy, which He promised to the house of Israel. Through my hand, He has killed the leader of your enemies!

(Judith 12:36) 
Then, drawing Holofernes's head from her basket, she showed it to them, saying: "Behold, the head of Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army! And behold his own mosquito netting, where he lay in his drunkenness, and where the Lord our God struck him down!"

(Judith 12:37) 
And the mouth of the Most High God was humbled, by being defeated by the hand of a woman.

(Judith 12:38) 
Then all the people worshipped God, saying: "Blessed are You, O Lord, who have utterly destroyed your enemies on this very day!"

(Judith 12:39) 
And Ozias, the leader of the people of Israel, said to Judith: "Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord, the most high God, above all women on the earth."

(Judith 12:40) 
Blessed be God, who created the universe and the earth, who guided you in striking down the head of the leader of our enemies! For today, He has so magnified your name that your praise will never depart from the mouths of men, who will forever remember the power of God. Amen, amen.

(Judith 13:1) 
When silence finally settled in the camp, Holofernes was weighed down by excessive wine and drunkenness, and he lay passed out on his bed.

(Judith 13:2) 
Judith called her maidservant and went out of the bedroom, just as she did every other day. This was because Bagoas believed the Jewish woman was asleep and not with Holofernes.

(Judith 13:3) 
Judith closed the door of her private room, and standing before God, she prayed with a loud voice, saying, "Lord God, You who possess all power, look upon this very hour and bring about my purpose."

(Judith 13:4) 
"Break the power of my enemies, and fulfill my plan. For all my strength is in You, and all my authority depends on Your arrangements."

(Judith 13:5) 
After she had prayed these things, she came to Holofernes’ tent and took his sword, which was hanging over his bed.

(Judith 13:6) 
And standing over his head, she uncovered his head, and she took her sword—meaning, she firmly grasped his sword, which was now her instrument.

(Judith 13:7) 
And she struck him twice in his neck, severing his head. She then took his head and gave it to her maidservant.

(Judith 13:8) 
The maidservant put the head into her bag. Then they both exited according to their custom, as if they were going out for prayers. They passed through the camp and ascended the mountain.

(Judith 13:9) 
When they were still in the camp but had reached the city gate, Judith said to the gatekeepers, "Open the city gates for me, and I will show you the head of Holofernes, the commander of the entire Assyrian army."

(Judith 13:10) 
After the gates were opened and they had entered the city, Judith called all the people together and showed them Holofernes' head, saying:

(Judith 13:11) 
"Behold, the head of Holofernes, the leader of the entire Assyrian army! And look at his canopy, under which he lay in his drunkenness! And behold, I myself struck him in his neck and severed his head!"

(Judith 13:12) 
And she said to them, "Give thanks to the Lord your God, who has saved you today from the hand of your enemies, and who gave Holofernes into my hands."

(Judith 13:13) 
And all the people who were in Jerusalem praised the Lord their God, saying, "Blessed are You, Lord our God, who has saved us today from the hand of our enemies."

(Judith 13:14) 
And all the people praised the Lord and adored God, saying, "Amen, Amen."

(Judith 14:1) 
Judith then said to all of them, "Listen to me, brothers! We will hang Holofernes' head on our city walls."

(Judith 14:2) 
"Then, every man who takes up weapons, and every person living in our city, should gather together. And you must all go out as if you are about to attack the enemies of the sons of Israel."

(Judith 14:3) 
"The goal is for the enemy to flee, so that we can capture the leaders of the Assyrians and advance towards their camps."

(Judith 14:4) 
"When their commanders see Holofernes' head, they will instantly turn and flee. They will try to escape by any means, over land and across the waters, and you must pursue them."

(Judith 14:5) 
After Judith had taught them these things, she commanded them to do exactly what she had told them.

(Judith 14:6) 
So Judith went up onto the city walls and hung Holofernes' head there. Then, every man took up his weapons, and they gathered just as she had instructed them.

(Judith 14:7) 
And it happened that when the morning light appeared, they displayed their weapons on the wall, and all of them went out together, making it seem as if they were launching an attack on the Assyrian camps.

(Judith 14:8) 
The Assyrian scouts saw them and immediately ran to their superiors, announcing what they had observed.

(Judith 14:9) 
When these superiors went to Holofernes' tent and did not find him, they reported it to their commanders.

(Judith 14:10) 
So the commanders went to Holofernes' tent. They stood around it and called out to the doorkeeper, who was lying before the tent's curtain, saying, "Open the tent, go inside, and tell your master:"

(Judith 14:11) 
"Your enemy has woken you up, and he has gone out to insult you, behaving like a loose woman."

(Judith 14:12) 
No one could stir him or open the tent, for they were all asleep together. Holofernes' eunuch, Bagoas, was drunk, as were all of his servants.

(Judith 14:13) 
So the commanders went with Bagoas and entered the tent. They found Holofernes lying on his bed, a decaying corpse.

(Judith 14:14) 
And immediately, they cried out in alarm. Tearing their clothes, they rushed out to their general and all his commanders.

(Judith 14:15) 
They announced to them that Holofernes was lying dead, and his head had been cut off.

(Judith 14:16) 
Every general and all the leaders of the Assyrians cried out in dismay. They were terrified and trembled with fear. Tearing their clothes, they rushed out to every part of their camps.

(Judith 14:17) 
They announced that Holofernes had been killed, and their leaders were dead, and their clothes were torn in lament. All of them together were extremely afraid, and they trembled and quaked with terror. They prepared to flee, not daring to speak to one another.

(Judith 14:18) 
Instead, everyone, as if in a single rush, prepared for flight. They abandoned everything that was in their camps as if they were fleeing for their lives.

(Judith 14:19) 
And when they knew that Holofernes was killed, they fled by the roads and through the mountains, and through all the valleys, and along all the paths, abandoning all their camps. All who fled were saved. But those who had remained in the camps were killed by the very ones who had fled, in the chaos of their desperate rout.

(Judith 15:1) 
Upon hearing the news of Holofernes’ death, our enemies immediately fled. They began to run in every direction across the plains and into the mountains. Those who were still in the Assyrian battle-camps, upon hearing that the Judean forces had captured and killed Holofernes, also fled in a panic.

(Judith 15:2) 
All who were scattered among the hills and mountains from the Assyrian camps, abandoning their war effort, continued to flee. Then the children of Israel, all who could find weapons, rushed against them, pursuing the retreating army.

(Judith 15:3) 
Holofernes had fallen in his own tent. And all of his army who had been besieging the gate of the city of Bethulia fled at once.

(Judith 15:4) 
Then Joakim, the High Priest, and the elders of Israel who lived in Jerusalem came to Bethulia to see Judith and greet her with honor.

(Judith 15:5) 
All the men and all the women of her city, Bethulia, came to her. When they had gathered, they all blessed her with one voice, saying: “You are the glory of Jerusalem! You are the joy of Israel! You are the honor of our people!”

(Judith 15:6) 
Because you did all these things by your own hand, you have brought great good to Israel. And you have stirred courage in their hearts and in our hearts with all these deeds. May a blessing be upon you forever.

(Judith 15:7) 
And all the people cried out, “Amen!”

(Judith 15:8) 
All the women of Israel gathered together around her and blessed her. After several days, Ozias, the ruler of the city, came to her and said to her:

(Judith 15:9) 
“Lady, may you be blessed by the Lord God of Israel, because this great thing has been accomplished through you.”

(Judith 15:10) 
And Judith responded to him: “As the Lord lives, victory has been achieved in Israel through my hand.”

(Judith 15:11) 
And Ozias said to her: “Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord God of Israel, because you did these things. The Lord empowered you and exalted your name, so that all people may glorify you.”

(Judith 15:12) 
And all the people said, “Amen!”

(Judith 15:13) 
And again Ozias said: “Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord God of Israel, because through you victory has been accomplished in Israel.”

(Judith 15:14) 
After thirty days, she returned to her home. And she did not have a man intimately in all the days of her life, from the day her husband Manasses died.

(Judith 15:15) 
She lived a life of honor and purity throughout those days, until her death. And she remained in her home until she was one hundred and five years old.

(Judith 15:16) 
They buried her in the tomb of Manasses, her husband. And they observed a seven-day mourning period for her.

(Judith 15:17) 
And no enemy attacked or troubled Israel in all the days of Judith’s life, and for a long time after her death.

(Judith 15:1) 
When all the inhabitants of Judea who were in the vicinity heard about the victory, they became as one mind.
They went out to meet the returning people.

(Judith 15:2) 
Everyone came out from Bethlehem, Bethmestim, Bethoron, Beli, Chola, Cades, the torrent stream, the city of Magdeddi, and from the fields and valleys.
They all went to meet them together, arriving in Bethulia on the third day.

(Judith 15:3) 
And all the Jews in Bethulia—men, women, and children—came out, each one wearing their best cloak.
They wanted to bless Judith and see her.

(Judith 15:4) 
And all of them came, and with one voice they blessed her, saying:
'You are the glory of Jerusalem! You are the joy of Israel! You are the honor of our people!'

(Judith 15:5) 
'For you have done all these things by your own hand, just as Israel has performed great deeds.
May you be blessed forever!'

(Judith 15:6) 
In those days, all the people in Bethulia blessed her with joy, gladness, and dancing.

(Judith 15:7) 
And all the men of Israel—namely, those who had fought—brought out the spoils they had taken from Holofernes.
This included all his silver, gold, garments, vessels, and all his furnishings. They gave everything to Judith.

(Judith 15:8) 
And all the people rejoiced and feasted with gladness in the presence of the holy people for thirty days.

(Judith 15:9) 
However, Judith gave everything that had belonged to Holofernes to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem.
This included all his spoils.

(Judith 15:10) 
The people in Bethulia rejoiced exceedingly because of Judith, and all of Israel was filled with joy.

(Judith 15:11) 
Then all the priests from Jerusalem gathered, and all the elders of Israel came.
They came to see the good things the Lord had done for Israel and to speak with Judith and bless her.

(Judith 15:12) 
And they rested from war for many days.
Then they went to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and purification to God.

(Judith 15:13) 
And Judith went up to Jerusalem with all the goods of Holofernes that the people had given her.
She dedicated all the offerings to the Lord and presented all the vows made by the people.

(Judith 15:14) 
And all the people saw her, and they blessed her, and they marveled at her.
Every day of her life was a blessing in the days of Israel.

(Judith 15:15) 
And Judith remained in Bethulia for many days.
All those who belonged to her household also remained in Bethulia.

(Judith 15:16) 
And she did not have intimate relations with a man until her death.
This means she remained a widow.

(Judith 15:17) 
And she left all her possessions to her handmaid, and all her wealth to her own house and family.
She also left everything she had received from Holofernes, and everything that had belonged to him.

(Judith 15:18) 
And she was honored at all times.
She lived honorably all her days in Bethulia.

(Judith 15:19) 
And there was no one in those days, or for many years after, who disturbed Israel after the death of Judith.

(Judith 16:1) 
At that time, Judith sang this song to the Lord, as she said:

(Judith 16:2) 
Start a new song to the Lord with drums, sing to Him with cymbals, play for Him with psalms and praises, for a new song has burst forth from Him.

(Judith 16:3) 
For the Lord is the One who crushes wars. Lord is His very name.

(Judith 16:4) 
He has established His presence among His people, so that He might deliver us from the power of all our enemies.

(Judith 16:5) 
Assyria came from the mountains to the north, with a mighty army. Its vast numbers blocked the rivers, and their horses covered the valleys of the land.

(Judith 16:6) 
Holofernes threatened to invade our land and kill our young men with a sword. He planned to give our infants as plunder and our virgins into captivity.

(Judith 16:7) 
But the Almighty Lord crushed them. He gave them into the hands of a woman, and they were defeated.

(Judith 16:8) 
Their powerful warriors did not fall by the hand of young men, nor did the strong, legendary giants strike them down. No mighty heroes attacked them.

(Judith 16:9) 
Instead, the hand of Judith, daughter of Merari, struck him with a fatal blow, and he fell, causing his army to flee.

(Judith 16:10) 
For all his strength and power would melt away like water.

(Judith 16:11) 
Holofernes was in his own camp, along with all his generals and his officers.

(Judith 16:12) 
Then they began to cry out to one another, asking, "Who is this person who dared to attack us in this manner?"

(Judith 16:13) 
And so it happened that they, and all who were with them, fled from the camp.

(Judith 16:14) 
Fear, trembling, and utter confusion overcame them, and they quickly departed, scattering into the desert.

(Judith 16:15) 
And the children of Israel, who were present at the camp, pursued the Assyrians all the way to the borders of their land.

(Judith 16:16) 
They returned, taking possession of everything the Assyrians had left behind.

(Judith 16:17) 
And they consecrated feast days, offered sacrifices to the Lord, and praised God, because He had saved them.

(Judith 16:18) 
And it happened that after many days, Holofernes and all his generals and officers had completely passed away from any influence over them, and were no longer a threat.

(Judith 16:19) 
And so the children of Israel departed with great joy and gladness, giving all praises and acts of thanksgiving to the Lord.

(Judith 16:20) 
They offered sacrifices to the Lord because He had saved them from the power of their enemies, and there were no longer any enemies within all their borders.

(Judith 16:21) 
And so the children of Israel remained in Jerusalem, celebrating the feast day.

(Judith 16:22) 
Judith was greatly honored throughout all the days of her life, and no one ever spoke an evil word against her.

(Judith 16:23) 
And it came to pass that after Judith's death, no one overcame her people throughout all the days of her descendants.

(Judith 16:24) 
And God granted her to rest in peace, and there was no war within all of her people's borders throughout all the days of her life and the days of her descendants.

(Judith 16:25) 
And she returned to her own house and remained there for many years. She died in Bethulia, and they buried her in her father's tomb.

(Judith 16:1) 
Let us sing a hymn to the Lord; let us sing a new hymn to our God.

(Judith 16:2) 
Help us to glorify Your Name, O Lord, for You have destroyed wars from the beginning of time.

(Judith 16:3) 
The Lord shatters wars, and His Name is holy.

(Judith 16:4) 
He who places His camp among His people, snatches my life from the hands of those who plot against me.

(Judith 16:5) 
Assyria came from the northern mountains, with the might of its great strength and a multitude of its soldiers. Their numbers covered the valleys, and their cavalry overran the hills.

(Judith 16:6) 
For he said he would burn my lands, kill my young men with the sword, dash my infants to the ground, give my little children as plunder, and lead my virgins into captivity.

(Judith 16:7) 
But the Lord Almighty crushed him and delivered him into the hands of a woman.

(Judith 16:8) 
For God is not glorified by the strength of men, nor by mighty warriors, but the saving Lord is praised among the humble and meek.

(Judith 16:9) 
For the Lord raises a shield for His people, and He places His fear upon all nations.

(Judith 16:10) 
He stirs up nations and destroys those whose plan was to trouble His people.

(Judith 16:11) 
Assyria came in fury, with the strength of its army, with its cavalry, its chariots, and a multitude of its fighters. Yet, they were not worthy to look upon the Lord God.

(Judith 16:12) 
For the Lord Almighty is His Name, and He crushed them into dust before His handmaid.

(Judith 16:13) 
Not only Holofernes, but also his army, He reduced to dust. And of all who came with him, no one escaped.

(Judith 16:14) 
My God, I will praise You, because all virtues and powers are found in You.

(Judith 16:15) 
My soul will rejoice in You, and in joy I will exult in You, for there is no other God besides You.

(Judith 16:16) 
I will sing a new song to my God; my Lord is great and glorious in His strength.

(Judith 16:17) 
For a new song has been sung to the Lord, and there is no one on earth like our God.

(Judith 16:18) 
For the Lord exalts the humble and humbles the proud.

(Judith 16:19) 
There is no one who can adequately praise You, O Lord Almighty, for You alone are the Almighty God.

(Judith 16:20) 
In times of tribulation, I will call upon You, and You will rescue me.

(Judith 16:21) 
For all things are in You, and all power, and all Your might.

(Judith 16:22) 
Let us sing a new song and new praise to our God.

(Judith 16:23) 
Let us magnify His Name, for He Himself is our God, and there is no other besides Him.

(Judith 16:24) 
Let all who are proud against You be put to shame; let them be put to shame forever.

(Judith 16:25) 
And let Him scatter them with fire and brimstone, and let all the earth adore Him.

(Judith 16:26) 
For all things are Your works, and they are in Your power, and all things that exist are in Your will.

(Judith 16:27) 
For the Lord is He who executes judgment throughout all the earth.

(Judith 16:28) 
Lord God, in whose will all things that exist are, and before whose sight all flesh is troubled.

(Judith 16:29) 
In Your judgment, all Your enemies will be overcome, and in Your wrath, all Your enemies will rise up (only to be destroyed).

(Judith 16:30) 
In Your mouth You have placed a sword, and in Your hands, fire.

(Judith 16:31) 
For every creature will serve You, and every spirit will honor You, because You are our Lord God, and there is no other besides You.

(Judith 16:32) 
Woe to the wicked nation, for they have acted wickedly, and the Lord will abhor them forever.

(Judith 16:33) 
And on the day of judgment, He will send fire and worms upon them, so that they may suffer forever.

(Judith 16:34) 
There is no one who can adequately praise You, O Lord Almighty, for You alone are the Almighty God.

(Judith 16:35) 
In this celebration, my soul will rejoice, and in joy I will exult in You, for there is no other God besides You.

(Judith 16:36) 
I will sing a new song to my God, for there is no one on earth like our God.

(Judith 16:37) 
For the Lord is He who crushed the proud, and in Your power are all things that exist.

(Judith 16:38) 
For every creature will serve You, and every spirit will honor You, because You are our Lord God, and there is no other besides You.

(Judith 16:39) 
In Your judgment, all Your enemies will be overcome, and in Your wrath, all Your enemies will rise up (only to be destroyed).

(Judith 16:40) 
In Your mouth You have placed a sword, and in Your hands, fire, so that they may suffer forever.
