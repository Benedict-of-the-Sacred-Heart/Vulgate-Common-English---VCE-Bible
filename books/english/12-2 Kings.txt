(2 Kings 1:1) 
After Ahab died, the nation of Moab revolted against Israel.

(2 Kings 1:2) 
Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and he became very ill. He then sent messengers, telling them: "Go, consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this sickness."

(2 Kings 1:3) 
However, the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "Get up and go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria. Then you shall say to them: 'Is there truly no God in Israel that you must go to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron?'"

(2 Kings 1:4) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'You will not leave the bed upon which you have climbed, but you will surely die.' And Elijah then departed.

(2 Kings 1:5) 
And the messengers returned to Ahaziah. He asked them: "Why have you returned?"

(2 Kings 1:6) 
They answered him: "A man met us and spoke to us, saying: 'Go, and return to the king who sent you, and speak to him: Thus says the Lord: "Is there truly no God in Israel that you send to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die."'

(2 Kings 1:7) 
Ahaziah asked them: "What was the appearance and manner of that man who met you and spoke these words to you?"

(2 Kings 1:8) 
And they told him: "He was a hairy man, with a leather belt wrapped around his waist." The king immediately knew and said: "It is Elijah the Tishbite!"

(2 Kings 1:9) 
So the king sent a captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men to Elijah. The captain went up to him, and Elijah was sitting on the top of a mountain. And the captain spoke to him: "Man of God, the king commands that you come down!"

(2 Kings 1:10) 
And Elijah responded, saying to the captain of fifty: "If I am a man of God, then let fire descend from the sky and consume you and your fifty men." And immediately fire descended from the sky, and it consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.

(2 Kings 1:11) 
Again, the king sent to him a second captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men. He spoke to Elijah: "Man of God, this is what the king says: 'Hurry, come down!'"

(2 Kings 1:12) 
And Elijah responded, saying: "If I am a man of God, then let fire descend from the sky and consume you and your fifty men." And immediately fire descended from the sky, and it consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.

(2 Kings 1:13) 
Again, the king sent a third captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men. When he came, he knelt before Elijah and pleaded with him, saying: "Man of God, please do not despise my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours."

(2 Kings 1:14) 
He continued: "Behold, fire has descended from the sky and consumed the first two captains of fifty and the fifty men who were under each of them. But now, I beg you, have mercy on my life!"

(2 Kings 1:15) 
And the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying: "Go down with him, do not be afraid." So Elijah rose up and went down with him to the king.

(2 Kings 1:16) 
And Elijah spoke to the king: "Thus says the Lord: 'Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel whose word could be inquired of, therefore you will not leave the bed upon which you have climbed, but you will surely die.'"

(2 Kings 1:17) 
So Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Joram, his brother, reigned in his place in the second year of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.

(2 Kings 1:18) 
As for the rest of the deeds of Ahaziah, and what he accomplished, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 1:1) 
After King Ahab died, the kingdom of Moab rebelled against the kingdom of Israel.

(2 Kings 1:2) 
Now King Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and he became very sick. He then sent messengers, telling them, 'Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this illness.'

(2 Kings 1:3) 
But the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and you shall say to them: Is there no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'

(2 Kings 1:4) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'From the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.' And Elijah went away to deliver this message.

(2 Kings 1:5) 
So the messengers returned to King Ahaziah. And he said to them, 'Why have you returned so quickly?'

(2 Kings 1:6) 
And they answered, 'A man met us and said to us: 'Go, and return to the king who sent you, and you shall tell him: This is what the Lord says: Is there no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.''

(2 Kings 1:7) 
And the king said to them, 'What kind of man was he who met you and spoke these words?'

(2 Kings 1:8) 
And they described him, saying, 'He was a hairy man, with a leather belt fastened around his waist.' And the king immediately realized, 'It is Elijah the Tishbite.'

(2 Kings 1:9) 
So the king sent a captain of fifty men, with his fifty soldiers who were under him, to Elijah. The captain went up to Elijah; and behold, Elijah was sitting on the top of a mountain. And the captain spoke to him, saying, 'Man of God, the king commands that you come down.'

(2 Kings 1:10) 
And Elijah answered the captain of fifty, 'If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty men.' So fire came down from the sky and consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.

(2 Kings 1:11) 
Again, King Ahaziah sent another captain of fifty men and fifty with him. And that captain spoke to Elijah, 'Man of God, the king says this: 'Hurry, come down!''

(2 Kings 1:12) 
And Elijah answered him, 'If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty men.' Therefore, fire came down from the sky and consumed that captain and the fifty men who were with him.

(2 Kings 1:13) 
Again, King Ahaziah sent a third captain of fifty men, with the fifty who were with him. When this captain came, he knelt down before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and spoke: 'Man of God, please do not despise my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'

(2 Kings 1:14) 
'For behold, fire has come down from the sky and consumed the two former captains of fifty and the fifty men who were with them. But now, I beg you, have mercy on my life.'

(2 Kings 1:15) 
Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, 'Go down with him; do not be afraid.' So Elijah arose and went down with the captain to the king,

(2 Kings 1:16) 
and he spoke to King Ahaziah: 'This is what the Lord says: 'Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel whose word you could inquire of, therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.''

(2 Kings 1:17) 
So King Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And his brother Jehoram (Joram) reigned in his place in the second year of Jehoram, the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.

(2 Kings 1:18) 
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 1:19) 
Now it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to the sky in a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha were going from Gilgal.

(2 Kings 1:20) 
And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.' Elisha replied to him, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' And when they had gone down to Bethel,

(2 Kings 1:21) 
the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And Elisha responded, 'Yes, I know; be silent about it.'

(2 Kings 1:22) 
And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Elisha, please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Jericho.' And Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' And when they had come to Jericho,

(2 Kings 1:23) 
the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And Elisha replied, 'Yes, I know; be silent about it.'

(2 Kings 1:24) 
And Elijah said to him, 'Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan River.' Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So both of them continued on their journey.

(2 Kings 1:25) 
Furthermore, fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them; and they stood facing them, from a distance, while Elijah and Elisha both stood by the Jordan.

(2 Kings 1:26) 
Then Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the Jordan, which then divided to both sides. And both Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.

(2 Kings 1:27) 
When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Ask what you desire for me to do for you, before I am taken from you.' And Elisha said, 'I beg you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.'

(2 Kings 1:28) 
Elijah answered, 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be granted to you as you have asked; but if you do not see me, it will not be granted.'

(2 Kings 1:29) 
As they walked on and talked together, behold, a fiery chariot and fiery horses appeared and separated the two of them. And Elijah ascended by a whirlwind into the sky.

(2 Kings 1:30) 
But Elisha, seeing this, cried out, 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!' And he saw Elijah no longer. Then Elisha took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.

(2 Kings 1:31) 
And Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan River.

(2 Kings 1:32) 
And with the mantle of Elijah, which had fallen from him, Elisha struck the waters, but they did not divide. Then he said, 'Where is the God of Elijah now?' And again he struck the waters, and they divided to one side and to the other; and Elisha crossed over.

(2 Kings 1:33) 
Now when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho saw him from a distance, they said, 'The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha.' And coming to meet him, they bowed down to the ground before him,

(2 Kings 1:34) 
and they said to him, 'Behold, we have fifty strong men with us who can go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys.' But Elisha replied, 'Do not send them.'

(2 Kings 1:35) 
But they urged him until he consented, saying, 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.

(2 Kings 1:36) 
When they returned to Elisha, who was still waiting in Jericho, he said to them, 'Did I not tell you: 'Do not send them?'

(2 Kings 1:37) 
Now the men of the city of Jericho also said to Elisha, 'Behold, the dwelling place of this city is excellent, as you yourself, our lord, perceive. But the waters are very bad, and the land is barren.'

(2 Kings 1:38) 
And Elisha said, 'Bring me a new jar and put salt in it.' So when they brought it to him,

(2 Kings 1:39) 
he went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: 'This is what the Lord says: 'I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more death or barrenness in them from now on.''

(2 Kings 1:40) 
So the waters were healed to this very day, according to the word of Elisha, which he had spoken.

(2 Kings 1:1) 
But after King Ahab died, the kingdom of Moab rebelled against Israel.

(2 Kings 1:2) 
But King Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room, which he had in Samaria, and became gravely ill. So he sent messengers, telling them, 'Go, consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this illness.'

(2 Kings 1:3) 
However, the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, instructing him: 'Go now, ascend to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: "Is there no God in Israel, that you must go and consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron?"'

(2 Kings 1:4) 
Therefore, the Lord declares this: 'You shall not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.' With this message, Elijah departed.

(2 Kings 1:5) 
When the messengers returned to King Ahaziah, he asked them, 'Why have you come back?'

(2 Kings 1:6) 
They answered him, 'A man met us and told us, "Go back to the king who sent you, and tell him: 'This is what the Lord says: Is there no God in Israel, that you must send to consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron? Because of this, you will not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.'"'

(2 Kings 1:7) 
He then asked them, 'What kind of man was it who met you and spoke these words to you?'

(2 Kings 1:8) 
They replied, 'He was a man dressed in a rough, hairy garment, with a leather belt around his waist.' The king then realized, 'It is Elijah the Tishbite!'

(2 Kings 1:9) 
So the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty soldiers. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a mountain, and addressed him, 'Man of God, the king commands you: "Come down!"'

(2 Kings 1:10) 
Elijah answered the captain of fifty, 'If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume both you and your fifty men.' Immediately, fire descended from the sky and consumed him and all fifty of his soldiers.

(2 Kings 1:11) 
Again, the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty soldiers. This captain addressed Elijah, 'Man of God, this is what the king says: "Hurry, come down!"'

(2 Kings 1:12) 
Elijah answered him, 'If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume both you and your fifty men.' Immediately, fire descended from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.

(2 Kings 1:13) 
Once more, the king sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty soldiers. When this captain arrived, he humbly knelt before Elijah and pleaded with him, saying, 'Man of God, please do not disregard my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'

(2 Kings 1:14) 
Behold, fire has already come down from the sky and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifty men. Now, I beg you, spare my life.

(2 Kings 1:15) 
Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, 'Go down with him; do not be afraid.' So Elijah rose, and went down with the captain to the king.

(2 Kings 1:16) 
Elijah then spoke to the king, saying, 'This is what the Lord declares: Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel from whom you could seek a prophetic word, you will not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.'

(2 Kings 1:17) 
So King Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken. His brother Joram then reigned in his place, because Ahaziah had no son. This occurred in the second year of Joram, son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah.

(2 Kings 1:18) 
As for the rest of the acts of King Ahaziah, and all that he did, are they not indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 2:1) 
Now it came about, when the Lord was about to take Elijah up into glory by means of a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha departed from Gilgal.

(2 Kings 2:2) 
And Elijah said to Elisha: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission to Bethel.' And Elisha replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went down to Bethel.

(2 Kings 2:3) 
Then the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him: 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he answered: 'Yes, I know; be silent.'

(2 Kings 2:4) 
And Elijah said to Elisha: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission to Jericho.' But he replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went to Jericho.

(2 Kings 2:5) 
Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him: 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he replied: 'Yes, I know; be silent.'

(2 Kings 2:6) 
And Elijah said to him: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission as far as the Jordan River.' But he replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both continued on their way.

(2 Kings 2:7) 
And fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them and stood at a distance, watching them. But Elijah and Elisha both stood by the Jordan River.

(2 Kings 2:8) 
Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the river. And the waters divided to both sides, so that both of them crossed over on dry ground.

(2 Kings 2:9) 
And when they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha: 'Ask what you wish me to do for you before I am taken from you.' And Elisha replied: 'I beg that a double portion of your spiritual power may come upon me.'

(2 Kings 2:10) 
He answered: 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, then what you have asked will be granted to you. But if you do not see me, it will not be.'

(2 Kings 2:11) 
And as they continued on their way, speaking together as they walked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah ascended into glory by means of a whirlwind.

(2 Kings 2:12) 
But Elisha saw it, and he cried out: 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!' And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.

(2 Kings 2:13) 
And he picked up the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan River.

(2 Kings 2:14) 
And with the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him, he struck the waters, but they did not divide. Then he said: 'Where is the God of Elijah now?' And he struck the waters again, and they divided to both sides. So Elisha crossed over.

(2 Kings 2:15) 
Now when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho saw him from across the river, they said: 'The spiritual power of Elijah rests upon Elisha.' And they came to meet him, bowing down to the ground before him.

(2 Kings 2:16) 
And they said to him: 'Behold, there are fifty strong men among your servants, who could go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys.' But he said: 'Do not send anyone.'

(2 Kings 2:17) 
But they urged him until he consented and said: 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, and after they had searched for three days, they did not find him.

(2 Kings 2:18) 
And when they returned to Elisha, who was sitting in Jericho, he said to them: 'Did I not tell you, 'Do not send anyone?'

(2 Kings 2:19) 
Then the men of the city said to Elisha: 'Behold, the situation of this city is excellent, as you yourself, my master, can see. But the waters are bad, and the land is barren.'

(2 Kings 2:20) 
And he said: 'Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.' And when they had brought it to him,

(2 Kings 2:21) 
he went to the spring of waters and cast the salt into it, and said: 'Thus says the Lord: I have healed these waters. From now on, there will be no more death or barrenness in them.'

(2 Kings 2:22) 
So the waters were healed to this very day, according to the word of Elisha, which he had spoken.

(2 Kings 2:23) 
And from there he went up to Bethel. And as he was going up by the way, some small boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: 'Go up, you bald head! Go up, you bald head!'

(2 Kings 2:24) 
When he looked back, he saw them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the forest and mauled forty-two of the boys.

(2 Kings 2:25) 
And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

(2 Kings 2:1) 
When the Lord was about to take Elijah up into the heavens by means of a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.

(2 Kings 2:2) 
And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Please, stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.' To which Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went down to Bethel.

(2 Kings 2:3) 
Then the company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to meet Elisha, and they asked him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he replied, 'Yes, I know that also; be silent.'

(2 Kings 2:4) 
Then Elijah said to Elisha again, 'Elisha, please stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as Jericho.' But Elisha insisted, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went on to Jericho.

(2 Kings 2:5) 
And the company of prophets who were in Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' He replied, 'Yes, I know that also; be silent.'

(2 Kings 2:6) 
Then Elijah said to him, 'Please, cross the Jordan, and stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan River.' But Elisha affirmed again, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So both of them continued on their way.

(2 Kings 2:7) 
And fifty men from the company of prophets followed them and stood watching from a distance, directly opposite them. But Elijah and Elisha themselves stood by the Jordan River.

(2 Kings 2:8) 
Then Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the Jordan. The waters parted to both sides, and both Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.

(2 Kings 2:9) 
When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Ask what you wish for me to do for you, before I am taken from you.' Elisha then replied, 'I beg you, let a double portion of your prophetic spirit be upon me.'

(2 Kings 2:10) 
Elijah responded, 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, then what you have asked will be granted to you. But if you do not see me, it will not be.'

(2 Kings 2:11) 
And as they continued on their way, still talking, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went up into the heavens by means of a whirlwind.

(2 Kings 2:12) 
But Elisha saw it, and he cried out, 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horseman!' —a declaration of Israel's strength and Elijah's importance. And he saw Elijah no more. Then, in his grief, Elisha took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.

(2 Kings 2:13) 
Then Elisha picked up Elijah’s mantle, which had fallen from him. He turned back and stood by the bank of the Jordan River.

(2 Kings 2:14) 
And with Elijah’s mantle, which had fallen from him, he struck the waters of the Jordan, but they did not part. So Elisha cried out, 'Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah, now?' He then struck the waters again, and they parted to both sides, and Elisha crossed over.

(2 Kings 2:15) 
When the company of prophets from Jericho, who had been watching from across the river, saw this, they declared, 'The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha!' And they came to meet him, bowing down before him with their faces to the ground.

(2 Kings 2:16) 
And they said to him, 'Behold, your servants have fifty strong men with us who could go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys.' But Elisha said, 'Do not send them.'

(2 Kings 2:17) 
But they urged him so persistently that he finally gave in and said, 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.

(2 Kings 2:18) 
When they returned to Elisha — for he was staying in Jericho — he said to them, 'Did I not tell you, 'Do not send them?'

(2 Kings 2:19) 
Then the men of the city of Jericho said to Elisha, 'Behold, the situation of this city is excellent, as you yourself, our master, can see. But its waters are very bad, and the land is unproductive.'

(2 Kings 2:20) 
But Elisha said, 'Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.' So they brought it to him.

(2 Kings 2:21) 
Then Elisha went out to the spring of the waters, and he cast the salt into it, declaring, 'Thus says the Lord: 'I have now healed these waters. From this moment on, there will be no more death nor barrenness from them.'' 

(2 Kings 2:22) 
And the waters have remained healed to this very day, according to the prophetic word that Elisha spoke.

(2 Kings 2:23) 
From there, Elisha went up towards Bethel. As he was going up by the road, some young lads came out from the city and began to mock him, shouting, 'Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!' — a taunt challenging his authority and connection to Elijah's ascent.

(2 Kings 2:24) 
And when Elisha turned and looked at them, he saw them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Immediately, two she-bears came out of the nearby forest and attacked them, tearing apart forty-two of the boys.

(2 Kings 2:25) 
Then Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel, and from Mount Carmel, he returned to Samaria.

(2 Kings 3:1) 
Moab, however, rebelled against Israel after Ahab's death.

(2 Kings 3:2) 
And Joram, Ahab's son, became king over Israel in Samaria during the twelfth year of Jehoshaphat, who was king of Judah. Joram reigned for twelve years.

(2 Kings 3:3) 
He did what was evil in the Lord's sight, though not to the same extent as his father Ahab or his mother Jezebel. For Joram removed the stone pillars of Baal that his father had set up.

(2 Kings 3:4) 
Now Mesha, the king of Moab, was a sheep breeder, and he used to pay tribute to the king of Israel: a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with their wool.

(2 Kings 3:5) 
But after Ahab died, Moab broke the treaty they had with the king of Israel.

(2 Kings 3:6) 
So King Joram left Samaria that day and took a census of Israel's fighting men.

(2 Kings 3:7) 
He then sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to fight against Moab?' Jehoshaphat replied, 'I will go up with you. My forces are like your forces, my people like your people, and my horses like your horses.'

(2 Kings 3:8) 
Then Joram asked, 'By what route should we advance?' And Jehoshaphat answered, 'By way of the desert of Edom.'

(2 Kings 3:9) 
So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out. They marched for seven days, but there was no water for their army or for the animals that followed them.

(2 Kings 3:10) 
Then the king of Israel cried out, 'Oh no! Has the Lord called these three kings together only to deliver them into the hand of Moab?'

(2 Kings 3:11) 
But Jehoshaphat asked, 'Is there no prophet of the Lord here through whom we might consult the Lord?' One of the servants of the king of Israel replied, 'Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here. He used to pour water on Elijah's hands'—meaning he was Elijah's personal assistant and successor.

(2 Kings 3:12) 
Jehoshaphat then declared, 'The Lord's message is indeed with him.' So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to meet Elisha.

(2 Kings 3:13) 
Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'What business do you and I have together? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother!' The king of Israel answered him, 'No, for the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.'

(2 Kings 3:14) 
Elisha declared, 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if I did not respect the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even look at you or acknowledge you.'

(2 Kings 3:15) 
But now, bring me a harpist. And as the harpist played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.

(2 Kings 3:16) 
And he said, 'Thus says the Lord: Dig many trenches in this dry streambed.'

(2 Kings 3:17) 
For thus says the Lord: 'You will neither see wind nor rain, yet this streambed will be filled with water, so that you, your troops, and your animals may drink.'

(2 Kings 3:18) 
And this is but a small thing in the Lord's sight. He will also deliver Moab into your hands.

(2 Kings 3:19) 
You will strike every fortified city and every excellent city. You will cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good field with stones.

(2 Kings 3:20) 
So it happened in the morning, at the time when the sacrifice was offered, that behold, water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.

(2 Kings 3:21) 
Now all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had come up to fight against them, gathered everyone who could put on a belt for battle and stood at their border.

(2 Kings 3:22) 
When they rose early in the morning, and the sun was shining opposite them, the Moabites saw the water in the distance, appearing to them like blood.

(2 Kings 3:23) 
And they said, 'This is blood! The kings must have fought with their swords and killed each other. Now, Moab, to the plunder!'

(2 Kings 3:24) 
But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, who fled before them. The Israelites pursued them and continued to strike Moab.

(2 Kings 3:25) 
They destroyed their cities and filled every good field with stones by throwing them. They stopped up every spring of water and cut down every fruit tree. So only the walls of stones were left in Kir-hareseth. Then the forces surrounded the city with slingers and attacked it.

(2 Kings 3:26) 
When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom's position, but they were unable.

(2 Kings 3:27) 
Then he took his eldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the city wall. This act caused great wrath to fall upon Israel. Immediately, they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.

(2 Kings 3:1) 
Joram, the son of Ahab, began to rule over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. He reigned for twelve years.

(2 Kings 3:2) 
He did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not to the extent of his father and mother, for he removed the stone column of Baal that his father had made.

(2 Kings 3:3) 
Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, and he did not turn away from them.

(2 Kings 3:4) 
Now Mesa, the king of Moab, was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel a tribute of one hundred thousand lambs, and one hundred thousand rams with their wool.

(2 Kings 3:5) 
But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

(2 Kings 3:6) 
So King Joram left Samaria that very day and reviewed all the men of Israel.

(2 Kings 3:7) 
He went and sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying: 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to fight against Moab?' Jehoshaphat replied: 'I will go up with you. My people are like your people, and my horses are like your horses.'

(2 Kings 3:8) 
Joram then asked: 'By which way should we march up?' Jehoshaphat answered: 'Through the way of the desert of Edom.'

(2 Kings 3:9) 
So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went forth. They marched in a roundabout way for seven days, and there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.

(2 Kings 3:10) 
The king of Israel cried out: 'Alas, alas! Has the Lord called these three kings together only to deliver them into the hand of Moab?'

(2 Kings 3:11) 
Then Jehoshaphat asked: 'Is there no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord through him?' One of the servants of the king of Israel answered: 'Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, he who poured water over the hands of Elijah.'

(2 Kings 3:12) 
And Jehoshaphat said: 'The word of the Lord is with him.' So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.

(2 Kings 3:13) 
Elisha said to the king of Israel: 'What concern have I with you? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother.' The king of Israel replied to him: 'No, because the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!'

(2 Kings 3:14) 
Then Elisha said: 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if it were not for my respect for Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even give you attention or look at you.'

(2 Kings 3:15) 
Now, bring me a harpist. And when the harpist played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.

(2 Kings 3:16) 
And he said: 'Thus says the Lord: Make this valley full of ditches, dig many ditches.'

(2 Kings 3:17) 
For thus says the Lord: 'You will not see wind, nor will you see rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your flocks will drink.'

(2 Kings 3:18) 
And this is but a small thing in the sight of the Lord: He will also deliver Moab into your hands.

(2 Kings 3:19) 
You will strike every fortified city and every excellent city. You will cut down every fruitful tree, and you will stop up all springs of water, and you will ruin every good field with stones.

(2 Kings 3:20) 
So it came to pass in the morning, at the time when the sacrifice is usually offered, that suddenly water came by the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.

(2 Kings 3:21) 
Now all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had come up to fight against them, gathered together everyone who could put on armor, from young men to old, and they stood at their borders.

(2 Kings 3:22) 
Rising early in the morning, as the sun rose opposite the water, the Moabites saw the water from afar, red like blood.

(2 Kings 3:23) 
And they said: 'This is the blood of the sword! The kings must have fought against each other and killed one another. Now, Moab, to the plunder!'

(2 Kings 3:24) 
But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, who fled before them. They pursued them, striking down and devastating Moab.

(2 Kings 3:25) 
They also destroyed the cities, and every good field they filled with stones by each man throwing a stone. They stopped up all the springs of water and cut down every fruitful tree, so that only the walls of the city of Kir Haraseth remained. The slingers surrounded it and struck it.

(2 Kings 3:26) 
When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through to the king of Edom, but he could not.

(2 Kings 3:27) 
Then he took his firstborn son, who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation in Israel. Immediately, they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.

(2 Kings 3:1) 
Moab rebelled against Israel after King Achab died.

(2 Kings 3:2) 
Now Joram, son of Achab, began his reign over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Josaphat's kingship in Judah, and Joram reigned for twelve years.

(2 Kings 3:3) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, yet not to the same degree as his father and mother had done, for he had removed the idols of Baal that his father had erected.

(2 Kings 3:4) 
Now Mesa, the king of Moab, was a wealthy sheep breeder, and he was required to pay the king of Israel a tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams with their wool.

(2 Kings 3:5) 
But when King Achab had died, Mesa, the king of Moab, openly rebelled against the king of Israel.

(2 Kings 3:6) 
So King Joram marched out from Samaria at that time and mustered all the fighting men of Israel.

(2 Kings 3:7) 
And Joram sent a message to Josaphat, the king of Judah, saying: 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to Moab to wage war?' Josaphat replied: 'I will indeed go with you. My resources are entirely at your disposal, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.'

(2 Kings 3:8) 
Then Joram asked, 'By what route should our army advance?' And Josaphat replied, 'We should go through the desert route of Edom.'

(2 Kings 3:9) 
So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom began their march. After they had traveled for seven days, there was no water left for their army or for the animals that accompanied them.

(2 Kings 3:10) 
Then the king of Israel cried out, 'Oh no! Has the Lord truly brought these three kings together just to deliver us into the hand of Moab?'

(2 Kings 3:11) 
Then Josaphat asked, 'Is there no prophet of the Lord present here, through whom we might inquire of the Lord's will?' One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, saying: 'Elisha, the son of Saphat, is here. He is the one who used to pour water on Elijah’s hands, serving him as a disciple.'

(2 Kings 3:12) 
Josaphat then declared, 'The Lord's message is truly with him.' So the king of Israel, Josaphat, and the king of Edom went down to Elisha.

(2 Kings 3:13) 
Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'What business do I have with you? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother, the prophets of Baal!' But the king of Israel pleaded with him, 'It is because the Lord has truly called these three kings together only to deliver us into the hand of Moab!'

(2 Kings 3:14) 
Then Elisha declared: 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before Whom I stand in service, if it were not for my respect for Josaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even look at you nor acknowledge your presence!'

(2 Kings 3:15) 
Now, therefore, bring me a musician to play a stringed instrument.' And while the musician played, the power of the Lord came upon Elisha.

(2 Kings 3:16) 
And Elisha declared: 'Thus says the Lord: "Dig many ditches and trenches throughout this dry valley!"'

(2 Kings 3:17) 
For thus says the Lord: 'Even though you will see no wind or rain, this valley will be filled with water, so that you, your families, and your animals can drink.'

(2 Kings 3:18) 
And this miracle alone is but a small thing in the sight of the Lord; He will also deliver Moab, your enemy, into your hands.

(2 Kings 3:19) 
And you will conquer every fortified city and destroy every important town. You will cut down every fruit-bearing tree, stop up every spring of water, and ruin every fertile field by covering it with stones.

(2 Kings 3:20) 
So it came to pass the next morning, at the hour when the daily sacrifice was customarily offered, and behold, water began to flow from the direction of Edom, and the land was quickly filled with water.

(2 Kings 3:21) 
Now all the Moabites, hearing that the allied kings had come up to fight against them, called together every man who was able to bear arms, from the youngest to the oldest, and they took their stand at their borders.

(2 Kings 3:22) 
And they rose early in the morning, and when the sun had fully risen, shining on the water, the Moabites looked and saw the water appearing as red as blood.

(2 Kings 3:23) 
And they exclaimed, 'This is blood! The allied kings must have fought fiercely and slaughtered each other with their swords! Everyone must have slain his neighbor! Now, therefore, Moab, let us go for the plunder!'

(2 Kings 3:24) 
But when the Moabites approached the camp of Israel, the men of Israel suddenly rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then fled in panic before them. As the Israelites pursued and struck down the Moabites, they continued to lay waste to the entire region.

(2 Kings 3:25) 
And the allied armies continued to destroy the cities, filling every fertile field with stones. They stopped up every spring of water and cut down every fruit-bearing tree, leaving only the stone walls of the final stronghold. They surrounded this last remaining city with siege works and relentlessly attacked it with sling stones from above.

(2 Kings 3:26) 
Now when the king of Moab saw that the battle was completely lost to his enemies, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, hoping to break through the lines towards the king of Edom; but they were unable to succeed.

(2 Kings 3:27) 
Then, in a desperate act, he took his eldest son, who was destined to succeed him as king, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the city wall. This act caused great moral indignation among the allied forces, who immediately withdrew from the city and returned to their own land.

(2 Kings 4:1) 
A certain woman, one of the wives of your prophet-disciples, cried out to Elisha, saying: 'My husband, your servant, is dead. And you know that your servant was a man who truly feared the Lord—a devout man. But now, a creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves, to settle their father's debt!'

(2 Kings 4:2) 
Elisha then asked her: 'What do you want me to do for you, my child? Tell me, what do you have in your house?' She replied: 'Your servant has absolutely nothing left in my house, except a tiny bit of oil, just enough for personal anointing.'

(2 Kings 4:3) 
And he said to her: 'Go now, and borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors—and make sure to get many of them, not just a few!'

(2 Kings 4:4) 
Then go inside, and close the door upon yourself and your sons. Begin to pour your existing oil into all these empty vessels. And as each vessel becomes full, set it aside.'

(2 Kings 4:5) 
So the woman went and did as Elisha commanded. She closed the door upon herself and her sons. Her sons began bringing her the empty vessels, and she continued pouring from her small jar.

(2 Kings 4:6) 
When all the vessels were full, she said to her son: 'Bring me another vessel.' But he responded: 'There are no more!' At that very moment, the flow of oil stopped completely.

(2 Kings 4:7) 
So she went and told the man of God what had happened. He said: 'Go, sell the oil, and repay your creditor. You and your sons can then live on the rest of the money.'

(2 Kings 4:8) 
It happened one day that Elisha was passing through Shunem. There was a prominent and wealthy woman there, who urged him to come and eat bread with her. So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.

(2 Kings 4:9) 
She said to her husband: 'I perceive that this is a holy man of God who frequently passes by our house.'

(2 Kings 4:10) 
She continued: 'Let us make a small room on the roof for him, and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.'

(2 Kings 4:11) 
So it happened one day that when Elisha came, he went to that room and rested there.

(2 Kings 4:12) 
Then he said to Gehazi, his servant: 'Call this Shunammite woman.' When Gehazi called her, and she stood before Elisha,

(2 Kings 4:13) 
Elisha said to Gehazi: 'Speak to her and tell her: “Behold, you have diligently provided for us and shown us every kindness. What do you wish that I do for you in return? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king, or to the commander of the army?”' She replied: 'I dwell among my own people—I lack nothing.'

(2 Kings 4:14) 
And Elisha asked: 'What then can be done for her?' Gehazi replied: 'She has no son, and her husband is an old man.'

(2 Kings 4:15) 
So Elisha commanded that she be called again. When she was called, and stood in the doorway, he said:

(2 Kings 4:16) 
'At this very time, in this same season, in the coming year, you shall embrace a son.' But she exclaimed: 'No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your handmaid!'

(2 Kings 4:17) 
And indeed, the woman conceived and bore a son at the very time and in the season that Elisha had promised her.

(2 Kings 4:18) 
The boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father, who was with the reapers in the field,

(2 Kings 4:19) 
and he cried out to his father: 'My head, my head aches! My head, my head aches!' His father then said to one of the servants: 'Carry him home, and take him to his mother.'

(2 Kings 4:20) 
So the servant carried him and brought him to his mother. She held him on her knees until midday, and then he died.

(2 Kings 4:21) 
Then she went up to the room, placed him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door, and left.

(2 Kings 4:22) 
She called her husband, saying: 'Please send me one of the young men and a donkey, so I can hurry to the man of God and return quickly.'

(2 Kings 4:23) 
He asked: 'For what reason are you going to him today? Is it the New Moon festival or the Sabbath day?' She replied, cryptically: 'It is well.' —meaning 'All is fine, I will explain later.'

(2 Kings 4:24) 
So she saddled the donkey and instructed her servant: 'Drive quickly; do not slow down the pace unless I tell you to.'

(2 Kings 4:25) 
Thus she went and arrived at the man of God, Elisha, on Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi: 'Look, it is that Shunammite woman!'

(2 Kings 4:26) 
'Run now to meet her,' he instructed, 'and ask her: “Is all well with you? Is all well with your husband? Is all well with your son?”' She replied, again briefly: 'All is well.'

(2 Kings 4:27) 
But when she reached the man of God on the mountain, she grasped his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said: 'Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness. The Lord has hidden it from me and has not revealed it to me.'

(2 Kings 4:28) 
And she cried out: 'Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say to you: “Do not deceive me”?'

(2 Kings 4:29) 
Elisha then said to Gehazi: 'Gird up your loins, take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone on the way, do not greet them; and if anyone greets you, do not answer them. Place my staff upon the face of the boy.'

(2 Kings 4:30) 
But the mother of the boy declared: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!' So Elisha arose and followed her.

(2 Kings 4:31) 
Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had placed the staff upon the boy's face. But there was no voice, nor any sign of life. So he returned to meet Elisha and reported to him, saying: 'The boy has not awakened.'

(2 Kings 4:32) 
Then Elisha entered the house, and behold, the boy was lying dead on his own bed.

(2 Kings 4:33) 
He went in and closed the door behind himself and the boy, and he prayed to the Lord.

(2 Kings 4:34) 
Then he went up and lay upon the boy, putting his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. He stretched himself out upon him, and the boy's flesh began to grow warm.

(2 Kings 4:35) 
Elisha then went down and walked around in the house once more. Then he went up again and stretched himself out upon the boy once more. And the boy sneezed seven times, and then opened his eyes.

(2 Kings 4:36) 
Elisha called Gehazi and told him: 'Call this Shunammite woman.' When she was called, she came in to him. He said: 'Take up your son!'

(2 Kings 4:37) 
She came in, fell at his feet, and prostrated herself on the ground in worship. Then she took up her son and went out.

(2 Kings 4:38) 
Elisha then returned to Gilgal. There was a severe famine in the land, and the prophet-disciples were sitting before him. He said to one of his servants: 'Put a large pot on the fire, and cook a stew for the prophet-disciples.'

(2 Kings 4:39) 
One of them went out into the field to gather herbs. He found a wild plant and gathered enough of its fruit to fill his cloak, —like wild gourds—. He came back and chopped them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what it was.

(2 Kings 4:40) 
So they served it to the men to eat. But when they tasted the stew, they cried out, saying: 'There is death in the pot, O man of God! There is death in the pot!' And they could not eat it.

(2 Kings 4:1) 
A certain woman, one of the wives of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying: “Your servant, my husband, is dead. You know that your servant lived in holy fear of the Lord. And now a creditor has come to take my two sons to be his slaves to pay off the debt.”

(2 Kings 4:2) 
And Elisha said to her: “What do you want me to do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?” And she responded: “Your handmaid has nothing in my house, except a small amount of oil.”

(2 Kings 4:3) 
He said: “Go and borrow many empty vessels from all your neighbors. Make sure there are not just a few.”

(2 Kings 4:4) 
Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour the oil into all these vessels. And when they are full, set them aside.”

(2 Kings 4:5) 
So the woman went away and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons. They brought the vessels to her, and she kept pouring.

(2 Kings 4:6) 
And when all the vessels were full, she said to her son: “Bring me still another vessel.” He responded: “There are no more.”

(2 Kings 4:7) 
And at that moment, the oil stopped flowing.

(2 Kings 4:8) 
So she came and told the man of God. He said: “Go, sell the oil, and pay the creditor. You and your sons can then live on the rest of the money.”

(2 Kings 4:9) 
Now it happened that Elisha was passing through Shunem. And there was a wealthy and influential woman there, who urged him to eat bread with her. So whenever he passed by, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.

(2 Kings 4:10) 
And she said to her husband: “I perceive that this man, who passes by us so frequently, is a holy man of God.”

(2 Kings 4:11) 
“Let us make a small upper room for him and put in it a small bed, and a table, and a chair, and a lamp. So that when he comes to us, he may stay there.”

(2 Kings 4:12) 
So it happened one day that Elisha came, and he turned aside to the upper room and rested there.

(2 Kings 4:13) 
And he said to Gehazi, his servant: “Call this Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, and she stood before him,

(2 Kings 4:14) 
Elisha said to his servant: “What do you want me to do for her?” Gehazi responded: “Indeed, she has no son, and her husband is old.”

(2 Kings 4:15) 
So he commanded: “Call her.” And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.

(2 Kings 4:16) 
And he said to her: “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your womb.” But she responded: “No, my lord, man of God, do not deceive your handmaid.”

(2 Kings 4:17) 
So the woman conceived and bore a son at that very time, and at the same hour, as Elisha had said.

(2 Kings 4:18) 
And the boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father among the reapers in the field.

(2 Kings 4:19) 
He said to his father: “My head hurts, my head hurts!” And his father said to a servant: “Take him and bring him to his mother.”

(2 Kings 4:20) 
And when the servant had taken him and brought him to his mother, the boy sat on her knees until midday, and then he died.

(2 Kings 4:21) 
But she went up and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, shut the door, and went out.

(2 Kings 4:22) 
And she called her husband, saying: “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and return.”

(2 Kings 4:23) 
He said: “For what reason are you going to him? It is not the new moon, nor the Sabbath.” These were the customary times people visited prophets. She responded: “It is well.”

(2 Kings 4:24) 
So she saddled the donkey and sat upon it. And she said to her servant: “Drive fast and hurry. Do not speak to me unless I tell you.”

(2 Kings 4:25) 
So she went, and came to the man of God on Mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to Gehazi, his servant: “Behold, there is that Shunammite woman!”

(2 Kings 4:26) 
“Go to meet her and ask: ‘Is all well? Is your husband well? Is your son well?’” And she responded: “All is well.”

(2 Kings 4:27) 
But when she came to the man of God on the mountain, she took hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said: “Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness. The Lord has hidden it from me and has not revealed it to me.”

(2 Kings 4:28) 
And she said: “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say to you: ‘Do not deceive me?’”

(2 Kings 4:29) 
And Elisha said to Gehazi: “Gird up your loins and prepare for urgent travel. Take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him. And if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Lay my staff upon the face of the boy.”

(2 Kings 4:30) 
And the mother of the boy said: “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So he arose and went with her.

(2 Kings 4:31) 
But Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had laid the staff upon the face of the boy. And there was no voice, nor any sign of life. So he returned and met Elisha, and announced to him, saying: “The boy has not awoken.”

(2 Kings 4:32) 
So Elisha went into the upper room, and behold, the dead boy lay upon his own bed.

(2 Kings 4:33) 
And having entered, he shut the door upon himself and upon the boy, and prayed to the Lord.

(2 Kings 4:34) 
Then he went up and lay upon the boy. He put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. And he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the boy grew warm.

(2 Kings 4:35) 
And he turned away and walked through the house once within, and then went up again. He stretched himself upon him, and the boy sneezed seven times, and then opened his eyes.

(2 Kings 4:36) 
And he called Gehazi, and said to him: “Call this Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, and she had come in to him, Elisha said: “Take your son.”

(2 Kings 4:37) 
She came, and fell at his feet, and bowed deeply in reverence towards the ground. Then she took her son and went out.

(2 Kings 4:38) 
Now Elisha returned to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land, and the community of prophets were sitting before him. And he said to one of his servants: “Put on the large pot and cook stew for the community of prophets.”

(2 Kings 4:39) 
But one went out into the field to gather wild herbs. He found something like a wild vine and gathered wild gourds from it, filling his cloak. And when he returned, he cut them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what it was. These gourds were poisonous.

(2 Kings 4:40) 
And they poured it out for their companions to eat. But when they had eaten of that stew, they cried out, saying: “Death is in the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it.

(2 Kings 4:1) 
A certain woman, one of the wives of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant, my husband, has died, and you know that your servant truly feared the Lord. Now, look, a creditor has come to take my two sons as slaves for himself to settle the debt."

(2 Kings 4:2) 
Then Elisha said to her, "What do you want me to do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" She answered, "Your maidservant has nothing at all in the house, except a single small jar of oil."

(2 Kings 4:3) 
He said, "Go now and borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors. Make sure there are not just a few of them, but many."

(2 Kings 4:4) 
Then, go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour the oil from your jar into all these borrowed vessels. When they are full, set them aside."

(2 Kings 4:5) 
So the woman went away and shut the door behind herself and her sons. They brought her the vessels, and she continued to pour the oil.

(2 Kings 4:6) 
When all the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." He responded, "There isn't another vessel left." And then the oil stopped flowing.

(2 Kings 4:7) 
Then she went and told the man of God what had happened. He said, "Go now, sell the oil, and pay your creditor. After that, you and your sons can live on the rest of the money."

(2 Kings 4:8) 
It came to pass one day that Elisha was passing through Shunem. There was a prominent woman there who urged him to eat bread. And whenever he passed by frequently, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.

(2 Kings 4:9) 
She said to her husband, "Look, I perceive that this man who passes by us so often is a holy man of God."

(2 Kings 4:10) 
"Let us make a small room for him on the roof, and put a bed in it for him, and a table, and a chair, and a lampstand. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there."

(2 Kings 4:11) 
So it came to pass one day that Elisha came, turned aside to the room on the roof, and rested there.

(2 Kings 4:12) 
He said to Gehazi, his servant, "Call this Shunammite woman." When Gehazi had called her, and she stood before Elisha,

(2 Kings 4:13) 
Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tell her: 'Behold, you have gone to great trouble for us with all your hospitality. What do you want me to do for you in return? Do you have any request you want me to speak to the king about, or to the commander of the army?'" She responded, "I live among my own people; I am content with my position in life and have no need of royal connections."

(2 Kings 4:14) 
Elisha then said, "What then can be done for her?" And Gehazi answered, "She has no son, and her husband is old."

(2 Kings 4:15) 
So he commanded that she be called. When she had been called and stood in the doorway, Elisha said,

(2 Kings 4:16) 
"At this same time next year, when life returns in its cycle, you will be holding a son in your arms." But she responded, "No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your maidservant about such a hope."

(2 Kings 4:17) 
And indeed, the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at that very time, at the exact hour Elisha had told her.

(2 Kings 4:18) 
So the boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father among the reapers in the field.

(2 Kings 4:19) 
He said to his father, "My head hurts, my head hurts!" So his father said to a servant, "Carry him and take him to his mother."

(2 Kings 4:20) 
When the servant had carried him and brought him to his mother, she laid him on her lap until noon, and then he died.

(2 Kings 4:21) 
But she went up to the room on the roof and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out.

(2 Kings 4:22) 
She called her husband, saying, "Send me one of the young men and a donkey, so I can ride quickly to the man of God and return."

(2 Kings 4:23) 
Her husband said to her, "Why are you going to him today? It is not the New Moon festival, nor is it the Sabbath day, when people typically seek out prophets." She responded, "All is well," keeping her son's death a secret.

(2 Kings 4:24) 
So she saddled the donkey and instructed her servant, "Drive steadily and hurry. Do not stop speaking to me on the way unless I tell you to."

(2 Kings 4:25) 
So she set out and came to the man of God on Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming from a distance, he said to Gehazi, his servant, "Look, there is that Shunammite woman."

(2 Kings 4:26) 
"Therefore, go meet her and ask: 'Are you well? Is your husband well? Is the boy well?'" She responded, "All is well."

(2 Kings 4:27) 
When she came to the man of God on the mountain, she grasped his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, "Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness and anguish, and the Lord has hidden it from me and not revealed it to me."

(2 Kings 4:28) 
And she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say to you, 'Do not deceive me with false hope' (by promising a son)?"

(2 Kings 4:29) 
Then Elisha said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand. Go quickly! If you meet anyone on the way, do not greet them with conversation, and if anyone greets you, do not answer them. Then, place my staff on the boy's face."

(2 Kings 4:30) 
But the boy's mother said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you and go without you." So Elisha rose and went with her.

(2 Kings 4:31) 
Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had placed the staff on the boy's face. But there was no voice, and no sign of life or consciousness. So he returned to meet Elisha and reported to him, saying, "The boy has not awakened."

(2 Kings 4:32) 
Then Elisha entered the room on the roof, and behold, the dead boy was lying on his bed.

(2 Kings 4:33) 
So he went out, closed the door behind him, and prayed to the Lord.

(2 Kings 4:34) 
Then he went up onto the bed and lay stretched out over the boy. He put his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, and his hands on the boy's hands. As he remained bowed over the boy, the boy's flesh grew warm.

(2 Kings 4:35) 
Then Elisha returned and walked around the house once or twice. After that, he went up again and stretched out over him. The boy then sneezed seven times, and he opened his eyes.

(2 Kings 4:36) 
Elisha called Gehazi and said to him, "Call that Shunammite woman." So she was called and came in to him. Elisha said, "Take up your son."

(2 Kings 4:37) 
She came, fell at his feet, and prostrated herself on the ground in worship and profound gratitude. Then she took up her son and went out.

(2 Kings 4:38) 
Elisha returned to Gilgal, as there was a severe famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him for instruction. He said to one of his servants, "Put a large pot on, and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets."

(2 Kings 4:39) 
Then one of them went out into the field to gather herbs. He found a wild plant and gathered from it wild gourds, filling his cloak. He returned and cut them into the pot of stew, without anyone knowing what they were.

(2 Kings 4:40) 
When the stew was poured out for the men to eat, as they ate, they cried out, saying, "There is death in the pot, O man of God!" And they could not eat it.

(2 Kings 5:1) 
Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, was a very rich, noble, and powerful man. However, he was a leper.

(2 Kings 5:2) 
Syrian raiders had previously gone out into Israel, and they had captured a young girl. This girl was now serving Naaman’s wife.

(2 Kings 5:3) 
The young girl said to her mistress, “If only my master Naaman would go to the prophet who lives in Samaria, he would certainly be cured of his leprosy.”

(2 Kings 5:4) 
Naaman then went to his king and reported what the girl from the land of Israel had said.

(2 Kings 5:5) 
The king of Syria told Naaman, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and six changes of fine clothing as gifts.

(2 Kings 5:6) 
He brought the letter to the king of Israel. The letter read: “When you receive this letter, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”

(2 Kings 5:7) 
When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, “Am I God, able to kill and to give life, that this man sends someone to me to be cured of leprosy? This is obviously a pretext; he is looking for a reason to attack me.”

(2 Kings 5:8) 
However, when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, saying: “Why have you torn your clothes? Let Naaman come to me, and he will know that there is a true prophet in Israel.”

(2 Kings 5:9) 
So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the entrance of Elisha’s house.

(2 Kings 5:10) 
Elisha sent a messenger out to Naaman, telling him, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”

(2 Kings 5:11) 
Naaman departed in anger, saying, “I thought he would come out to me personally, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place of my leprosy, and cure me.”

(2 Kings 5:12) 
He continued, “Are not the rivers of Damascus, Abana and Pharphar, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” He then turned and went away in a rage.

(2 Kings 5:13) 
His servants approached him and reasoned with him, saying, “Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some difficult thing, you would certainly have done it. How much more, then, when he simply tells you: ‘Wash, and you will be clean’?”

(2 Kings 5:14) 
So Naaman went down and washed himself seven times in the Jordan, just as the man of God had instructed. His flesh was restored, becoming like the flesh of a young child, and he was completely clean.

(2 Kings 5:15) 
Then Naaman returned to the man of God with all his company. He came and stood before Elisha and declared, “Now I truly know that there is no other God in all the earth except in Israel. Therefore, I beg you, please accept a gift from your servant.”

(2 Kings 5:16) 
Elisha replied, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing from you.” Naaman urged him, but Elisha refused.

(2 Kings 5:17) 
Then Naaman said, “If you will not accept a gift, then please, let me, your servant, be given two mule-loads of this Israelite earth. For from now on, your servant will no longer offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to foreign gods, but only to the Lord.”

(2 Kings 5:18) 
Naaman continued, “But in this one thing, I ask the Lord to forgive your servant: when my king enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon along with him, may the Lord forgive me, your servant, for this act of bowing.”

(2 Kings 5:19) 
Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” So Naaman departed from him, and had traveled only a short distance.

(2 Kings 5:20) 
Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “Look, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, by not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will surely run after him and get something from him!”

(2 Kings 5:21) 
So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he quickly dismounted from his chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”

(2 Kings 5:22) 
Gehazi replied, “Yes, everything is well. My master sent me, saying, ‘Look, two young men, members of the prophets’ community, have just arrived from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”

(2 Kings 5:23) 
Naaman said, “By all means, take two talents!” He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two changes of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.

(2 Kings 5:24) 
When Gehazi reached the hill, he took the gifts from their hands and put them away in the house. Then he sent the men away, and they departed.

(2 Kings 5:25) 
He then went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked him, “Where have you come from, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant has not been anywhere.”

(2 Kings 5:26) 
But Elisha replied, “Was not my spirit present when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money, and to accept clothes, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and male and female servants?” This rhetorical question from Elisha implies that it was a time of spiritual significance, not personal gain.

(2 Kings 5:27) 
Elisha concluded, “Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” And immediately, Gehazi departed from Elisha, a leper, white as snow.

(2 Kings 5:1) 
Naaman was the commander of the Syrian king’s army. He was a great man and highly esteemed by his master, because the Lord had granted the Syrians victory through him. He was also a powerful and wealthy man, but he was suffering from leprosy.

(2 Kings 5:2) 
Now some raiders had gone out from the land of Syria, and they had taken captive a young girl from the land of Israel, who now served Naaman’s wife.

(2 Kings 5:3) 
She said to her mistress, 'If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would certainly cure him of the leprosy he has.'

(2 Kings 5:4) 
So Naaman went in and told his master, saying, 'The girl from the land of Israel said these things.'

(2 Kings 5:5) 
And the king of Syria said to him, 'Go, and I will send letters to the king of Israel.' When Naaman departed, he took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and six changes of garments.

(2 Kings 5:6) 
And he brought the letters to the king of Israel, saying, 'When you receive this letter, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.'

(2 Kings 5:7) 
When the king of Israel read the letters, he tore his clothes in grief and alarm, and said, 'Am I God, that I can kill and make alive, that this man sends to me to cure a person of his leprosy? Observe and see that he is seeking an opportunity for conflict against me.'

(2 Kings 5:8) 
When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, saying, 'Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel, a man of God who can intercede.'

(2 Kings 5:9) 
So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and he stopped at the door of Elisha’s house.

(2 Kings 5:10) 
And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, 'Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan River, and your flesh will be restored to health, and you will be clean from your leprosy.'

(2 Kings 5:11) 
Naaman departed in anger, saying, 'I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place of the leprosy, and cure me.'

(2 Kings 5:12) 
'Are not the rivers of Damascus, Abana and Pharpar, better than all the waters of Israel, that I might wash in them and be clean?' And when he had turned away and was going off in indignation, his servants approached him.

(2 Kings 5:13) 
His servants approached him and spoke to him, saying, 'My father, even if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would surely have done it. How much more now that he has said to you, ‘Wash, and you will be clean’?'

(2 Kings 5:14) 
So he went down and washed seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean.

(2 Kings 5:15) 
And he returned to the man of God with all his company. He came and stood before him, and said, 'Now I truly know that there is no other God in all the earth, except only in Israel. Therefore, I beg you to accept a gift from your servant.'

(2 Kings 5:16) 
Elisha answered, 'As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.' And though Naaman urged him, he refused to take the gift.

(2 Kings 5:17) 
Naaman then said, 'If you will not accept a gift, then please, let two mule-loads of earth be given to your servant. For your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord, the one true God.'

(2 Kings 5:18) 
But for this one thing alone I pray to the Lord, that when my king enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow myself in the temple of Rimmon while he worships in that place — may the Lord forgive your servant for this action, understanding that it is out of duty to my king, not true worship of an idol.

(2 Kings 5:19) 
And Elisha said to him, 'Go in peace.' So Naaman had traveled only a short distance from him.

(2 Kings 5:20) 
But Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, said, 'Behold, my master has let this Naaman, this Syrian, depart without accepting from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him!'

(2 Kings 5:21) 
So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he dismounted from his chariot to meet him, and said, 'Is everything well?'

(2 Kings 5:22) 
And Gehazi said, 'All is well. My master sent me, saying: Behold, just now two young men from the hill country of Ephraim, from the sons of the prophets, have come to me. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.'

(2 Kings 5:23) 
Naaman said, 'No, rather take two talents of silver!' And he urged him to take it. Then Naaman tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two changes of garments, and put them on two of his servants, who then carried them ahead of Gehazi.

(2 Kings 5:24) 
When Gehazi arrived at the hill, he took the gifts from their hands and stored them in his house. Then he sent the men away, and they departed.

(2 Kings 5:25) 
And he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, 'From where have you come, Gehazi?' He answered, 'Your servant went nowhere.' He was attempting to deceive his master.

(2 Kings 5:26) 
But Elisha said, 'Was not my spirit present when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time now to receive money, and to receive garments, and to buy olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and male servants, and female servants?'

(2 Kings 5:27) 
'Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your descendants forever.' And Gehazi went out from his presence, a leper, as white as snow.

(2 Kings 6:1) 
And the disciples of the prophets spoke to Elisha, saying, "Look, this place where we are living with you is too small for all of us."

(2 Kings 6:2) 
They continued, "Let's go down to the Jordan River, and each of us can cut down a tree trunk or log so we can build a larger dwelling place for ourselves there."

(2 Kings 6:3) 
And Elisha responded, "Go ahead."

(2 Kings 6:4) 
Then one of the prophets' disciples said to Elisha, "Please come with us, your servants."

(2 Kings 6:5) 
Elisha replied, "I will come with you." So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees and logs.

(2 Kings 6:6) 
As one of them was cutting down a log, the iron axe-head flew off the handle and sank into the water. He cried out in dismay, "Oh no, my master! And I borrowed this axe!"

(2 Kings 6:7) 
The man of God, Elisha, asked, "Where did it fall?" The disciple showed him the exact spot. So Elisha cut off a small piece of wood, threw it into the water at that spot, and the iron axe-head immediately floated to the surface.

(2 Kings 6:8) 
At that time, the King of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted with his military commanders, saying, "I will set up an ambush at this particular place."

(2 Kings 6:9) 
But the man of God, Elisha, sent a message to the King of Israel, warning him, "Be careful not to pass through that specific location, because the Syrian army has set an ambush there."

(2 Kings 6:10) 
So the King of Israel sent a scouting party to the place Elisha had warned him about and had already given him a heads-up. Because he took precautions, he and his army were saved from danger, not just once or twice, but many times.

(2 Kings 6:11) 
The King of Syria became greatly disturbed by these repeated failures. He called his military commanders together and demanded, "Why aren't you telling me which one of you is betraying us to the King of Israel?"

(2 Kings 6:12) 
One of his commanders answered, "It's not that at all, my Lord King. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who reveals to the King of Israel every single word you speak, even those uttered in the privacy of your innermost chamber!"

(2 Kings 6:13) 
The King of Syria commanded, "Go and find out where he is, so I can send men to capture him!" His scouts reported back to him, saying, "He is in the city of Dothan."

(2 Kings 6:14) 
So the King of Syria dispatched a large army there, with horses and chariots, a truly powerful force. They marched all night and arrived at Dothan before dawn, completely surrounding the city.

(2 Kings 6:15) 
When Elisha's personal servant woke up early and went outside, he saw a vast army, with horses and chariots, completely surrounding Dothan. He rushed back to Elisha and cried out, "Oh no, my master! What are we going to do?"

(2 Kings 6:16) 
But Elisha replied, "Do not be afraid; for there are more with us than there are with them!"

(2 Kings 6:17) 
Then Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open his eyes so that he may see!" And the Lord immediately opened the servant's eyes, and he looked up and saw, and there, on the mountains surrounding Elisha, was a magnificent sight: the mountain was completely full of horses and chariots made of fire, encircling Elisha.

(2 Kings 6:18) 
As the Syrian soldiers came down the mountain toward Elisha, Elisha prayed to the Lord, "Please strike these people with blindness!" And the Lord struck them with complete blindness, just as Elisha had prayed.

(2 Kings 6:19) 
Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road, and this isn't the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are searching for." So Elisha led them, still blind, all the way to Samaria—the capital city of Israel.

(2 Kings 6:20) 
Once they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open the eyes of these men so they may see!" And the Lord opened their eyes, and they could see again. And they realized with shock that they were right in the middle of Samaria, surrounded by their enemies.

(2 Kings 6:21) 
When the King of Israel saw the Syrian army suddenly appear in the heart of his capital city, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father?"

(2 Kings 6:22) 
Elisha answered, "No, do not kill them! Would you normally kill captives you have taken with your own sword and bow? Instead, give them food and water, so they can eat and drink, and then send them back to their master, the King of Syria."

(2 Kings 6:23) 
So the King of Israel prepared a magnificent feast for the Syrian soldiers. They ate and drank, and then he sent them away, and they returned to their master. After this event, the Syrian raiding parties stopped invading the land of Israel for a significant time.

(2 Kings 6:24) 
However, sometime later, after these events, Ben-Hadad, the King of Syria, gathered his entire army, marched to Samaria, and laid siege to the city.

(2 Kings 6:25) 
A terrible famine gripped Samaria during the siege. The siege lasted so long that a donkey's head, normally considered unclean food, was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and even a quarter-kab of dove's droppings, a truly repulsive and desperate measure, was sold for five pieces of silver.

(2 Kings 6:26) 
As the King of Israel was walking along the city wall to inspect the defenses, a woman cried out to him desperately, "Help me, my Lord King!"

(2 Kings 6:27) 
The king replied, "If the Lord won't help you, how can I possibly help you? Do I have grain from the threshing floor, or wine from the winepress to give you?"

(2 Kings 6:28) 
Then the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman here said to me: 'Give up your son, so we can eat him today,' and then tomorrow we will eat my son."

(2 Kings 6:29) 
So we cooked my son, and we ate him. But the next day, when I told her, 'Now it's your turn, give us your son so we can eat him!' she hid her son.

(2 Kings 6:30) 
When the king heard the woman's story, he tore his clothes in a powerful display of grief and repentance. As he continued along the wall, all the people saw that beneath his royal robes, he was wearing sackcloth against his skin—a sign of deep mourning and humility before God.

(2 Kings 6:31) 
He then swore an oath, saying, "May God punish me severely and even more if I allow Elisha, the son of Shaphat, to live through this day!"

(2 Kings 6:32) 
Elisha was sitting in his house at the time, and the elders of Israel were sitting with him. The King of Israel had sent an executioner to behead Elisha. But before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha, knowing by divine revelation, said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer—referring to the king—has sent someone to cut off my head? When he arrives, make sure the door is shut and hold him back with the doors! For listen, the sound of his master's footsteps—the king himself—is right behind him!"

(2 Kings 6:33) 
While Elisha was still speaking, the king's messenger arrived at the door. And immediately after him, the king himself ascended and began to speak, saying, "This terrible evil—this famine—comes directly from the Lord! Why should I continue to hope or wait for any help from the Lord?"

(2 Kings 6:1) 
Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, this place where we gather and stay with you is now too small for us."

(2 Kings 6:2) 
So let's go down to the Jordan River, and each of us will cut down a log there. Then we can build ourselves a larger place to live in. Elisha replied, "Go ahead."

(2 Kings 6:3) 
But one of them said, "Please, come with your servants." He answered, "I will come."

(2 Kings 6:4) 
So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began to cut down trees.

(2 Kings 6:5) 
But as one of them was cutting down a log, the iron head of his axe fell into the water. He cried out, "Oh no, my master! And it was borrowed!"

(2 Kings 6:6) 
The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place. So Elisha cut off a piece of wood and threw it into the water at that spot, and the axe head floated to the surface.

(2 Kings 6:7) 
Elisha said, "Pick it up." The man reached out his hand and took it.

(2 Kings 6:8) 
Now the King of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted with his officers, saying, "I will set up an ambush at such and such a place."

(2 Kings 6:9) 
But the man of God — Elisha — sent a message to the King of Israel, saying, "Be careful not to pass through that specific place, because the Syrians are hiding there in ambush."

(2 Kings 6:10) 
So the King of Israel sent a warning to the place which the man of God had told him about and had forewarned him against. The king saved his army there not just once or twice.

(2 Kings 6:11) 
The King of Syria's heart was greatly troubled by this, so he called his officers together and asked them, "Why don't you tell me which of us is betraying us to the King of Israel?"

(2 Kings 6:12) 
One of his officers replied, "By no means, my lord and king. It is Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, who tells the King of Israel all the words you speak even in your secret bedchamber."

(2 Kings 6:13) 
The king said to them, "Go and find out where he is, so I can send men to capture him." They reported to him, saying, "Look, he is in Dothan."

(2 Kings 6:14) 
So the king sent horses and chariots and a great army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the city.

(2 Kings 6:15) 
When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, he saw an army surrounding the city with horses and chariots. The servant said to him, "Oh no, my master! What shall we do?"

(2 Kings 6:16) 
But Elisha said, "Do not be afraid. For there are more with us than there are with them."

(2 Kings 6:17) 
Then Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, open this young man's eyes so he may see." And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw! Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

(2 Kings 6:18) 
When the Syrians came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying, "Strike this nation with blindness, I beg You." And the Lord struck them with blindness, just as Elisha had requested.

(2 Kings 6:19) 
Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road, nor is this the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you seek." So he led them into Samaria, the capital of Israel.

(2 Kings 6:20) 
When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, "Lord, open the eyes of these men so they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they looked around. Behold, they realized they were in the middle of Samaria!

(2 Kings 6:21) 
When the King of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?"

(2 Kings 6:22) 
Elisha answered, "You must not strike them down. Do you strike down even those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Set food and water before them, so they may eat and drink, and then return to their master, the King of Syria."

(2 Kings 6:23) 
So the King of Israel prepared a great feast for them. After they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away. They returned to their master, and the raiding parties of the Syrians did not come into the land of Israel again.

(2 Kings 6:24) 
However, after this, Ben-Hadad, the King of Syria, gathered his entire army, marched up, and besieged Samaria.

(2 Kings 6:25) 
There was a great famine in Samaria. The city was under such a long siege that a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a quarter of a cab (a small measure) of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. People were desperate for any food.

(2 Kings 6:26) 
As the King of Israel was walking along the city wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help me, my lord and king!"

(2 Kings 6:27) 
He replied, "If the Lord does not save you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress? I have no food to give."

(2 Kings 6:28) 
Then the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we can eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'"

(2 Kings 6:29) 
So we cooked my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, 'Give up your son so we can eat him.' But she hid her son away.

(2 Kings 6:30) 
When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. As he walked along the wall, all the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath, against his skin.

(2 Kings 6:31) 
Then the king said, "May God do so to me, and even more, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, remains on his shoulders this very day!"

(2 Kings 6:32) 
Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king had sent a messenger to behead Elisha. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent someone to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it fast against him with the door bar. For indeed, the sound of his master's footsteps is right behind him!"

(2 Kings 6:33) 
While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger appeared. And the messenger said, "Look, this disaster is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"

(2 Kings 6:1) 
The sons of the prophets—that is, the disciples under Elisha's guidance—told Elisha: "Look, the place where we are staying with you is too small for us."

(2 Kings 6:2) 
"Let's go all the way to the Jordan River, and each of us will take a single log from the trees there, so we can build ourselves a new dwelling place." Elisha replied: "Go ahead."

(2 Kings 6:3) 
Then one of them said, "Please, come with your servants as well." He answered: "I will come."

(2 Kings 6:4) 
So he went with them. And when they arrived at the Jordan River, they began to cut down trees.

(2 Kings 6:5) 
It happened that as one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe-head fell into the water. He cried out in distress and said: "Oh no, my master! And I even borrowed this axe-head."

(2 Kings 6:6) 
And the man of God—that is, Elisha—asked: "Where did it fall?" The man showed him the spot. So Elisha cut off a piece of wood and threw it toward that place, and the axe-head floated to the surface.

(2 Kings 6:7) 
And Elisha said: "Pick it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.

(2 Kings 6:8) 
Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel, and after taking counsel with his servants, he said: "In such and such a place I will set an ambush."

(2 Kings 6:9) 
Therefore, the man of God—Elisha—sent word to the king of Israel, saying: "Be careful not to pass through that specific place, because the Syrians are lying in ambush there."

(2 Kings 6:10) 
And the king of Israel sent men to the place that the man of God had told him about and had warned him of. And the king of Israel took precautions there, not just once or twice.

(2 Kings 6:11) 
The heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this matter. He called his servants together and said: "Why don't you tell me who among us is a traitor to the king of Israel?"

(2 Kings 6:12) 
And one of his servants said: "By no means, my lord king. It is not a traitor among us, but rather Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, who tells the king of Israel all the words that you speak even in your private bedchamber."

(2 Kings 6:13) 
So the king said: "Go and see where he is, so that I may send and capture him." And it was reported to him by those who said: "Look, he is in Dothan."

(2 Kings 6:14) 
Therefore, he sent horses and chariots and a strong army there. When they arrived by night, they surrounded the city.

(2 Kings 6:15) 
So at dawn, the servant of the man of God arose and went out, and he saw the army encircling the city, with horses and chariots. And he reported to Elisha, saying: "Oh no, my master, what shall we do?"

(2 Kings 6:16) 
But Elisha answered: "Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more numerous than those who are with them."

(2 Kings 6:17) 
And Elisha prayed and said: "Lord, open this young man's eyes so that he may see." And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

(2 Kings 6:18) 
Now as the Syrians came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying: "Please, strike this people with blindness." And the Lord struck them with blindness, according to Elisha's word.

(2 Kings 6:19) 
And Elisha said to them: "This is not the way, nor is this the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are seeking." So he led them to Samaria.

(2 Kings 6:20) 
And when they had entered Samaria, Elisha said: "Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria—the capital city of Israel, deep within enemy territory.

(2 Kings 6:21) 
And the king of Israel, seeing them, said to Elisha: "Should I strike them down, my father?"

(2 Kings 6:22) 
Elisha replied: "You shall not strike them down. For you would not strike down even those you captured with your sword and your bow in battle. Instead, set bread and water before them, so that they may eat and drink, and then return to their master."

(2 Kings 6:23) 
So the king prepared a great meal for them. And they ate and drank, and he sent them away, and they returned to their master. And the raiding parties of Syria did not come into the land of Israel any more.

(2 Kings 6:24) 
But it came to pass after these events that Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his army, and marched up and besieged Samaria.

(2 Kings 6:25) 
And there was a great famine in Samaria. And it was besieged for so long that an ass's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver—an exorbitant price for an unclean animal—and a quarter of a measure of dove's dung was sold for five pieces of silver—a sign of extreme desperation.

(2 Kings 6:26) 
As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying: "Help me, my lord king!"

(2 Kings 6:27) 
And he said: "May the Lord help you! How can I help you? Is it from the threshing floor or from the winepress?"—implying he had no provisions from either.

(2 Kings 6:28) 
And the king asked her: "What is your trouble?" And she replied: "This woman said to me: 'Give your son, so that we may eat him today, and then tomorrow we will eat my son.'"

(2 Kings 6:29) 
"So we cooked my son and ate him. And the next day, I said to her: 'Give your son, so that we may eat him.' But she hid him."

(2 Kings 6:30) 
When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his garments, and as he walked along the wall, all the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath, next to his skin, as a sign of mourning and repentance.

(2 Kings 6:31) 
And he said: "May God do to me and add to it more punishment, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, remains on him this day!"—meaning he swore to execute Elisha.

(2 Kings 6:32) 
Elisha, however, was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. So the king sent a man from his presence. But before the messenger could arrive, Elisha said to the elders: "Do you see that this son of a murderer—meaning the king—has sent someone to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold him back with it. For behold, the sound of his master's feet is right behind him."

(2 Kings 6:33) 
While he was still speaking—Elisha, that is—the messenger who was coming to him appeared. And the messenger said: "Behold, such great evil has come from the Lord! Why should I wait any longer for the Lord's help?"

(2 Kings 7:1) 
Then Elisha, the prophet, said: 'Listen now to the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord says: Tomorrow, at this same time of day, within the gates of Samaria, the famine will be over. Then, two measures of fine flour will be sold for just one silver coin, and four measures of barley will be sold for one silver coin.'

(2 Kings 7:2) 
But the royal officer, upon whose arm the king leaned (indicating his high trust and authority), answered the man of God, saying: 'Even if the Lord were to open floodgates in the sky and make food rain down, could this possibly happen?' And Elisha, the prophet, replied: 'You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not partake in the abundance that follows.'

(2 Kings 7:3) 
Now there were four men afflicted with leprosy near the entrance of the city gate. They said to one another, 'Why are we sitting here until we die?'

(2 Kings 7:4) 
If we decide to go into the city, we will die there from starvation. If we remain here, we will also die. So come, let us desert and go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives, we will live. But if they kill us, then we will simply die.

(2 Kings 7:5) 
So they rose up in the evening to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp, they found no one there.

(2 Kings 7:6) 
For the Lord had caused the Syrian army in the camp to hear the sound of chariots and of horses, and the sound of a very large army approaching. And they had said to one another: 'Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us and come against us.'

(2 Kings 7:7) 
Therefore, rising up, they fled in silence, abandoning their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the entire camp, exactly as it was. They simply fled for their lives.

(2 Kings 7:8) 
So when those lepers came to the edge of the camp, they entered one tent, and they ate and drank. They took from there silver, gold, and clothing, and they went away and hid them. Then they returned to another tent, and from there they took more things and hid them too.

(2 Kings 7:9) 
Then they said to one another: 'What we are doing is not right. This is a day of good news, and if we remain silent and do not report it until morning, we will be found guilty of a terrible crime. Come, let us go and report it in the king's palace.'

(2 Kings 7:10) 
So when they arrived at the city gate, they called out, saying: 'We came to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no one there! There was no sound of people, but only horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents just as they were left.'

(2 Kings 7:11) 
Therefore, they reported it to the gatekeepers of the city, who immediately announced it in the king's palace.

(2 Kings 7:12) 
Then the king rose up in the night and said to his servants: 'I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and that is why they have left their camp and hidden themselves in the fields, thinking: When the people come out of the city looking for food, we will capture them alive, and then we will enter the city ourselves.'

(2 Kings 7:13) 
One of his servants answered him: 'Let us take five of the remaining horses in the city. Indeed, the entire multitude of Israel that remains here is already like those who have perished (meaning, they are near death from starvation). Let us send them out, and see what is happening.'

(2 Kings 7:14) 
So they sent two horses and chariots (presumably carrying men), and they went out after them, saying: 'Go and see!'

(2 Kings 7:15) 
They followed the Syrians all the way to the Jordan River. And behold, the entire road was full of clothing and equipment, which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste to flee. And returning, they reported it to the king.

(2 Kings 7:16) 
Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. And just as the Lord had declared, two measures of fine flour were sold for one silver coin, and four measures of barley were sold for one silver coin.

(2 Kings 7:17) 
Now the king had appointed that very royal officer (who was his close advisor) to be in charge of the gate. But the crowd trampled him in the gateway as they rushed out, and he died, just as the man of God had prophesied when the king came to him (earlier, during the famine).

(2 Kings 7:18) 
For it happened exactly according to the word of the man of God, who had said to the king: 'Two measures of fine flour will be sold for one silver coin, and four measures of barley will be sold for one silver coin, by this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.'

(2 Kings 7:19) 
When that officer had also responded to the man of God, saying: 'Even if the Lord were to open floodgates in the sky, could this possibly happen?' And Elisha had said to him: 'You will indeed see it with your own eyes, but you will not partake in that abundance.'

(2 Kings 7:20) 
And it happened to him just as Elisha had foretold: for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died there.

(2 Kings 7:1) 
It happened that the king was dwelling securely in his own house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,

(2 Kings 7:2) 
he then said to Nathan the prophet: “Look, I am living in a house built with cedar wood, but the Ark of God, which represents the Lord's presence, is placed only inside curtains.”

(2 Kings 7:3) 
And Nathan said to the king: “Go and do everything that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you in this endeavor.”

(2 Kings 7:4) 
However, it happened that in that very night, behold, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:

(2 Kings 7:5) 
“Go and speak to My servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord: Are you the one who will build a house for Me to dwell in?’”

(2 Kings 7:6) 
“For I have not lived in a permanent house from the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day; instead, I have moved about in a tabernacle, which is a portable sanctuary, and in a tent.”

(2 Kings 7:7) 
“In all the places through which I have passed with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, to whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: ‘Why have you not built Me a cedar house?’”

(2 Kings 7:8) 
“And now, you shall say this to My servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the pastures, from following the flock, so that you would be a leader over My people Israel.’”

(2 Kings 7:9) 
“And I have been with you in all places wherever you have walked, and I have destroyed all your enemies from before you; and I have made for you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.”

(2 Kings 7:10) 
“And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and I will plant them there, and they will live securely under their own rule, and they will not be disturbed any longer; nor will the sons of wickedness oppress them again, as they did at the first,”

(2 Kings 7:11) 
“from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Furthermore, the Lord proclaims to you that He Himself will make a house for you—a dynasty and a lasting lineage.”

(2 Kings 7:12) 
“And when your days are completed, and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom firmly.”

(2 Kings 7:13) 
“He himself will build a house for My name, a temple of worship, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”

(2 Kings 7:14) 
“I will be to him a father, and he himself will be to Me a son. If he does anything wickedly, I will discipline him with the rod of men, and with the scourges of the sons of men, as a father would correct his child.”

(2 Kings 7:15) 
“But My mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from My presence.”

(2 Kings 7:16) 
“And your house shall be faithful, and your kingdom shall endure forever before you; and your throne shall be firm perpetually.”

(2 Kings 7:17) 
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

(2 Kings 7:18) 
Then King David entered and sat before the Lord, and he said: “Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me to this point of favor?”

(2 Kings 7:19) 
“But even this is a small thing in Your sight, Lord God, unless You have also spoken concerning the house of Your servant for a long time to come; this is the law and decree of man, Lord God, that such a promise would be made.”

(2 Kings 7:20) 
“Therefore, what more can David add by speaking to You? For You know Your servant, Lord God, and all his thoughts.”

(2 Kings 7:21) 
“Because of Your word, and according to Your own heart's desire, You have done all these great things, so that You might make them known to Your servant.”

(2 Kings 7:22) 
“For this reason, You are magnified, Lord God, for there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, in all that we have heard with our own ears.”

(2 Kings 7:23) 
“And what other nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom You went to redeem for Yourself as a people, and to make a name for Yourself, and to perform great and terrible things for them on the earth, delivering them from the face of Your nation whom You redeemed for Yourself out of Egypt, from their peoples and their false worship?”

(2 Kings 7:24) 
“And You have established Your people Israel for Yourself as a people forever; and You, O Lord, have become their God.”

(2 Kings 7:25) 
“Now therefore, Lord God, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, fulfill it eternally; and do as You have spoken.”

(2 Kings 7:26) 
“So that Your name may be magnified forever, and people may say: ‘The Lord of hosts is God over Israel,’ and the house of Your servant David may be established before You.”

(2 Kings 7:27) 
“For You, Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant, by whispering in his ear, saying: ‘I will build a house for you.’ Because of this, Your servant has found the courage in his heart to pray this prayer to You.”

(2 Kings 7:28) 
“Now therefore, Lord God, You are God, and Your words will be true; for You have spoken these good things to Your servant.”

(2 Kings 7:29) 
“Begin therefore and bless the house of Your servant, so that it may be forever before You; for You, Lord God, have spoken, and with Your blessing, the house of Your servant will be blessed eternally.”

(2 Kings 7:1) 
Then Elisha said, "Hear the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord says: At this very hour tomorrow, a seah (a measure) of fine flour will be sold for three shekels (a unit of silver currency), and two seahs of barley for four shekels, right at the market gate of Samaria."

(2 Kings 7:2) 
However, one of the king's officers, who was responsible for the king's personal safety and whose arm the king leaned upon, answered the man of God, saying, "Even if the Lord were to open the floodgates of the sky, could such a thing actually happen?" And Elisha said, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."

(2 Kings 7:3) 
Now there were four men who had leprosy sitting near the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why are we sitting here until we die?"

(2 Kings 7:4) 
If we go into the city, we will die there because of the famine. If we stay here, we will surely die. So come on, let's desert to the camp of the Arameans (Syrians). If they spare our lives, we will live. If they kill us, then we will simply die.

(2 Kings 7:5) 
So they got up in the evening to go to the camp of the Arameans. When they came to the edge of the Aramean camp, they found no one there.

(2 Kings 7:6) 
For the Lord had made the Aramean army hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a very large army. So they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come and attack us!"

(2 Kings 7:7) 
Because of this, they got up and fled silently in the evening, abandoning their tents, their horses, their donkeys in the camp, and everything just as it was. They simply fled for their lives.

(2 Kings 7:8) 
So when those men with leprosy came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank. They took silver, gold, and clothing from there, and went and hid them. Then they returned to another tent and likewise took things from there and hid them.

(2 Kings 7:9) 
Then they said to one another, "What we are doing is not right. This is a day of good news, and if we keep silent and do not report it until morning, we will be held accountable for our wickedness. Come now, let's go and report it to the king's palace."

(2 Kings 7:10) 
So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city, saying, "We went to the camp of the Arameans, and we found no one there, nor any sound of a human, but only horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents just as they were left."

(2 Kings 7:11) 
The gatekeepers then went and announced the news inside the king's palace.

(2 Kings 7:12) 
The king rose up in the night and said to his servants, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and that is why they have left their camp and hidden themselves in the fields. They are thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and then enter the city.'"

(2 Kings 7:13) 
One of his servants answered him and said, "Let's take five of the remaining horses in the city, because the entire population of Israel remaining in it will be like those who are already dead. Indeed, the entire population of Israel is almost consumed by the famine. Let us send them out and see what is happening."

(2 Kings 7:14) 
So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them to the Aramean camp, saying, "Go and see."

(2 Kings 7:15) 
They went after them as far as the Jordan River. And behold, the entire road was full of garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their haste when they were in a panic. The messengers returned and reported this to the king.

(2 Kings 7:16) 
Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of fine flour was sold for three shekels, and two seahs of barley for four shekels, exactly as the Lord had spoken.

(2 Kings 7:17) 
Now the king had put that officer, on whose arm he leaned, in charge of the city gate. But the crowd trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had prophesied when the king came down to speak with him.

(2 Kings 7:18) 
So it happened exactly according to the word of the man of God, which he had spoken to the king when he said: "Two seahs of barley will be sold for four shekels, and a seah of fine flour for three shekels, tomorrow at the gate of Samaria."

(2 Kings 7:19) 
And when that officer had answered him and said, "What if the Lord were to open the floodgates of the sky, could such a thing actually happen?" Elisha had said to him, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."

(2 Kings 7:20) 
And it happened to him just as it had been said, because the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.

(2 Kings 8:1) 
Eliseus then spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, telling her: 'Get up, and go, you and your entire household, and reside as a foreigner wherever you can; for the Lord has commanded a devastating famine upon this land, and it will last for seven years.'

(2 Kings 8:2) 
So the woman got up, and she left with all of her household, and they resided as foreigners in the land of the Philistines for the entire seven years.

(2 Kings 8:3) 
And when the seven years were finished, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she went to appeal to the king about her house and her fields, which had likely been taken by others.

(2 Kings 8:4) 
Now, the king was speaking with Giezi, the servant of the man of God, Eliseus. The king was saying: 'Tell me all the great things Eliseus has done.'

(2 Kings 8:5) 
As Giezi was telling how Eliseus had raised the dead boy back to life, the very woman whose son Eliseus had restored to life appeared, crying out to the king concerning her house and her fields. Then Giezi said: 'My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Eliseus brought back to life.'

(2 Kings 8:6) 
And the king questioned the woman, and she told him her story. Then the king gave her an official, saying: 'Restore to her all that is hers, and all the income from her fields, from the day she left the land until now.'

(2 Kings 8:7) 
Eliseus also went to Damascus, and Benadad, the king of Syria, was sick. And it was announced to him, with people saying: 'The man of God has come here!'

(2 Kings 8:8) 
And the king said to Hazaël, one of his officials: 'Take gifts with you, and go to meet the man of God, and consult the Lord through him, asking: "Will I recover from this illness?"'

(2 Kings 8:9) 
So Hazaël went to meet him, bringing gifts with him—all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. And when he arrived, he stood before Eliseus and said: 'Your son Benadad, the king of Syria, has sent me to you, asking: "Will I recover from this illness?"'

(2 Kings 8:10) 
And Eliseus said to him: 'Go, tell him: "You will surely recover"— but the Lord has shown me that he will certainly die.'

(2 Kings 8:11) 
And Eliseus stood with him, staring intently. Hazaël became troubled and embarrassed, and then the man of God, Eliseus, wept.

(2 Kings 8:12) 
To him, Hazaël said: 'Why is my lord weeping?' Eliseus answered: 'Because I know what evils you will inflict upon the children of Israel: you will set their fortified cities on fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, you will dash their little ones to pieces, and you will rip open their pregnant women.'

(2 Kings 8:13) 
And Hazaël said: 'What is your servant, a mere dog, that I should do such a great evil?' And Eliseus said: 'The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Syria.'

(2 Kings 8:14) 
And when he had departed from Eliseus, he came to his master. Who said to him: 'What did Eliseus say to you?' And he answered: 'He told me: "You will surely recover."

(2 Kings 8:15) 
But the very next day, Hazaël took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and spread it over Benadad’s face, smothering him. And when he was dead, Hazaël reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:16) 
In the fifth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram, son of Josaphat, king of Juda, began to reign.

(2 Kings 8:17) 
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 8:18) 
And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Achab had walked, because a daughter of Achab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Kings 8:19) 
However, the Lord would not destroy Juda, for the sake of David, His servant, just as He had promised him by speaking, and by giving him a lamp—a continuous line of descendants—and to his sons for all days.

(2 Kings 8:20) 
In his days, Edom revolted so that it would no longer be under the rule of Juda, and it appointed a king for itself.

(2 Kings 8:21) 
So Joram went to Seira, and all the chariots with him. And he rose up in the night and attacked the Idumeans who had surrounded him, along with the commanders of their chariots; but the people fled to their tents.

(2 Kings 8:22) 
Therefore Edom revolted from being under Juda, and it remains so to this present day. At that same time, Libna also revolted.

(2 Kings 8:23) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?

(2 Kings 8:24) 
And Joram slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David. And Ochozias, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:25) 
In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, Ochozias, son of Joram, king of Juda, began to reign.

(2 Kings 8:26) 
Ochozias was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athalia, daughter of Amri, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 8:27) 
And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just like the house of Achab, for he was a son-in-law of Achab.

(2 Kings 8:28) 
He also went with Joram, son of Achab, to war against Hazaël, king of Syria, in Ramoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

(2 Kings 8:29) 
So Joram returned to be healed in Jezraël because of the wounds that the Syrians had inflicted on him in Ramoth, when he fought against Hazaël, the king of Syria. And Ochozias, son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to visit Joram, son of Achab, who was sick in Jezraël.

(2 Kings 8:1) 
But Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Rise up, you and your household, and go live as a foreigner wherever you can; for the Lord has called a famine upon the land, and it will last for seven years."

(2 Kings 8:2) 
So she rose up and went with all her household, and lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for seven years.

(2 Kings 8:3) 
When the seven years were finished, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went out to appeal to the king concerning her house and her fields.

(2 Kings 8:4) 
Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Tell me all the great works that Elisha has done."

(2 Kings 8:5) 
As Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had raised the dead, the very woman whose son Elisha had restored to life appeared, crying out to the king concerning her house and her fields. And Gehazi said, "My lord king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha raised from the dead!"

(2 Kings 8:6) 
The king then questioned the woman, and she told him her story. So the king gave her an official, saying, "Restore to her all that belonged to her, and all the income from her fields, from the day she left the land until now."

(2 Kings 8:7) 
Now Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad king of Syria was sick. They reported to him, saying, "The man of God has come here!"

(2 Kings 8:8) 
And the king said to Hazael, "Take gifts with you, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord through him, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"

(2 Kings 8:9) 
So Hazael went to meet Elisha, carrying gifts with him, all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. When he came, he stood before him and said, "Your son Ben-hadad, king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"

(2 Kings 8:10) 
And Elisha said to him, "Go, tell him, 'You will certainly recover.' However, the Lord has shown me that he will surely die a different death."

(2 Kings 8:11) 
Then Elisha stared fixedly until Hazael was confused and ashamed; and the man of God wept.

(2 Kings 8:12) 
And Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: you will burn their fortified cities with fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and you will dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women."

(2 Kings 8:13) 
To which Hazael said, "Who is your servant, my lord, but a dog, that I should do this great evil?" And Elisha said, "The Lord has shown me that you will be king of Syria."

(2 Kings 8:14) 
So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. And Ben-hadad said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And Hazael answered, "He told me, 'You will recover your health.'"

(2 Kings 8:15) 
But the next day, Hazael took a thick blanket, soaked it in water, and spread it over Ben-hadad's face, so he suffocated. When Ben-hadad was dead, Hazael reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:16) 
In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel—while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah—Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, began to reign as king of Judah.

(2 Kings 8:17) 
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 8:18) 
And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Kings 8:19) 
However, the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah for the sake of David His servant, just as He had promised him that He would give him a lamp, a line of descendants, for all days.

(2 Kings 8:20) 
In his days, Edom revolted from being under the rule of Judah and appointed a king for themselves.

(2 Kings 8:21) 
So Jehoram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. Then the people fled to their tents.

(2 Kings 8:22) 
Thus Edom revolted from being under Judah to this present day. At that time, Libnah also revolted.

(2 Kings 8:23) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 8:24) 
And Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David; and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:25) 
In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.

(2 Kings 8:26) 
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 8:27) 
And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, just like the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of Ahab's house.

(2 Kings 8:28) 
He also went with Joram, son of Ahab, to fight against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

(2 Kings 8:29) 
So Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him at Ramoth, when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. And Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to visit Joram, son of Ahab, in Jezreel, because he was sick.

(2 Kings 8:1) 
Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had brought back to life, saying: "Get up and leave, you and your household, and find a place to live as a foreigner wherever you can, because the Lord has called for a famine to come upon the land, and it will last for seven years."

(2 Kings 8:2) 
So she got up and left with all her household, and lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for seven years.

(2 Kings 8:3) 
And when the seven years were completed, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. She went out to appeal to the king concerning her house and her fields, seeking their restoration.

(2 Kings 8:4) 
Meanwhile, the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying: "Tell me all the great and powerful things that Elisha has done."

(2 Kings 8:5) 
And just as Gehazi was telling how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life, the very woman appeared, whose son Elisha had restored to life, crying out to the king about her house and her fields. Gehazi then said: "My lord king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."

(2 Kings 8:6) 
And the king questioned the woman, and she told him her story. So the king gave her an official, saying: "Restore to her all that belongs to her, and all her fields from the day she left the land until now."

(2 Kings 8:7) 
Elisha also came to Damascus, when Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, was sick. And they announced to the king, saying: "The man of God has come here."

(2 Kings 8:8) 
And the king said to Hazael: "Take gifts with you, and go to meet the man of God. Consult the Lord through him, saying: 'Will I be able to recover from this illness?'"

(2 Kings 8:9) 
So Hazael went to meet Elisha, carrying gifts with him, and all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. And when he stood before him, he said: "Your son Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying: 'Will I be able to recover from this illness?'"

(2 Kings 8:10) 
And Elisha said to him: "Go and tell him: 'You will certainly recover.' However, the Lord has shown me that he will nevertheless surely die by other means."

(2 Kings 8:11) 
And the man of God stood there, troubled, and then wept.

(2 Kings 8:12) 
Hazael said to him: "Why does my lord weep?" And Elisha said: "Because I know the evils you will inflict upon the children of Israel: you will burn their strongholds with fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, you will dash their little ones to pieces, and you will rip open their pregnant women."

(2 Kings 8:13) 
And Hazael said: "But what am I, your servant, a mere dog, that I should do such a great deed?" And Elisha said: "The Lord has shown me that you will be king of Syria."

(2 Kings 8:14) 
And when he had departed from Elisha, he came to his master, who asked him: "What did Elisha say to you?" And Hazael responded: "He told me: 'You will certainly recover.'"

(2 Kings 8:15) 
However, the next day, Hazael took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and spread it over Ben-Hadad's face, so that he suffocated and died. And Hazael reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:16) 
In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, and while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Joram, son of Jehoshaphat, became king of Judah.

(2 Kings 8:17) 
He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 8:18) 
And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Kings 8:19) 
Yet the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, just as He had promised him that He would always give him and his sons a lamp, meaning a perpetual lineage on the throne.

(2 Kings 8:20) 
In those days, Edom revolted and separated from the control of Judah, and set up a king for themselves.

(2 Kings 8:21) 
So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him; but the rest of the Edomite people had already fled to their tents.

(2 Kings 8:22) 
And Edom remained separate from the control of Judah until this present day. At that time, Libnah also revolted.

(2 Kings 8:23) 
The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 8:24) 
And Joram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. Then Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 8:25) 
In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, son of Joram, king of Judah, began to reign.

(2 Kings 8:26) 
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, daughter of Omri, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 8:27) 
And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did; for he was allied by marriage to the house of Ahab.

(2 Kings 8:28) 
He also went with Joram, son of Ahab, to fight against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramoth-Gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram.

(2 Kings 8:29) 
Joram then returned to Jezreel to recover, because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramah when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. Ahaziah also, son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Joram, son of Ahab, because he was sick.

(2 Kings 9:1) 
Elisha the prophet called one of the disciples of the prophets and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for travel, and take this small jar of oil with you in your hand, then go to Ramoth Gilead.'

(2 Kings 9:2) 
When you arrive there, find Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, who is the son of Nimshi. When you find him, take him away from his companions and lead him into a hidden private chamber.

(2 Kings 9:3) 
Then, take the jar of oil and pour it over his head, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you to be king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee immediately, and do not delay.

(2 Kings 9:4) 
So the young man, the prophet's disciple, went to Ramoth Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:5) 
When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting together. He said, 'I have a message for you, commander.'

(2 Kings 9:6) 
Jehu asked, 'Which of us are you speaking to?'
He replied, 'To you, commander.'

(2 Kings 9:7) 
So Jehu got up and went into the private chamber. The young man poured the oil over his head and said to him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have anointed you king over the Lord's people, Israel.'

(2 Kings 9:8) 
'You are to strike down the household of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord's servants, at the hand of Jezebel.'

(2 Kings 9:9) 
'I will destroy the house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel.'

(2 Kings 9:10) 
'I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.'

(2 Kings 9:11) 
'As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her body in the field of Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'

(2 Kings 9:12) 
Then he opened the door and fled, just as Elisha commanded.

(2 Kings 9:13) 
When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they asked him, 'Is everything all right? What did that madman want with you?'

(2 Kings 9:14) 
He answered them, 'You know the man and what he said.'

(2 Kings 9:15) 
But they insisted, 'That's not true! Tell us what he said!'
He then told them, 'He said such and such to me, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.''

(2 Kings 9:16) 
They quickly took off their cloaks, and each man spread his own under Jehu's feet, forming an impromptu royal carpet. Then they sounded the trumpet and shouted, 'Jehu is king!'

(2 Kings 9:17) 
So Jehu plotted against Joram. Now Joram, along with all of Israel, was guarding Ramoth Gilead against Hazael, the king of Syria.

(2 Kings 9:18) 
King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted upon him when he fought against Hazael, the king of Syria.
Jehu then said, 'If you are with me, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'

(2 Kings 9:19) 
So Jehu mounted his chariot and rode to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there wounded. Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had also come down to visit Joram.

(2 Kings 9:20) 
Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu approaching with his company and exclaimed, 'I see a chariot approaching!'

(2 Kings 9:21) 
Joram said, 'Harness my chariot!' So they harnessed his chariot, and King Joram of Israel, along with King Ahaziah of Judah, each in their own chariots, went out to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.

(2 Kings 9:22) 
When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Is it peace, Jehu?' Jehu replied, 'What peace can there be? The harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her many sorceries are still flourishing!'

(2 Kings 9:23) 
Then Joram turned his chariot around to flee, crying out to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah!'

(2 Kings 9:24) 
But Jehu drew his bow with his own hand and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.

(2 Kings 9:25) 
Jehu then said to Bidkar, his captain, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how, when you and I were riding in chariots behind Ahab his father, the Lord pronounced this sentence against him, saying:'

(2 Kings 9:26) 
'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,' says the Lord, 'and I will repay you in this very field,' says the Lord. 'So now, take him and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord.'

(2 Kings 9:27) 
When Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the road of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and said, 'Strike him down too, in his chariot!'
They struck him down at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo and died there.

(2 Kings 9:28) 
His servants carried him in his chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.

(2 Kings 9:29) 
In the eleventh year of Joram, son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.

(2 Kings 9:30) 
So Jehu came to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about his arrival, she painted her eyes with dark makeup, arranged her hair, and looked out a window.

(2 Kings 9:31) 
As Jehu entered the city gate, she called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?'

(2 Kings 9:32) 
Jehu looked up to the window and called out, 'Who is on my side? Who?'
Two or three eunuchs looked out to him.

(2 Kings 9:33) 
He said to them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and she was trampled underfoot.

(2 Kings 9:34) 
After Jehu went in, and had eaten and drunk, he said, 'Go and look after that cursed woman and bury her, for she was a king's daughter.'

(2 Kings 9:35) 
But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

(2 Kings 9:36) 
When they returned and reported this to him, Jehu said, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the field of Jezreel, dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.''

(2 Kings 9:37) 
'The corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say: 'This is Jezebel.'' This is her fate.

(2 Kings 9:1) 
Now, Elisha the prophet called one of the young men from the school of the prophets, and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for a journey and take this flask of anointing oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:2) 
When you get there, find Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go inside, call to him, and then bring him away from his companions, leading him into an inner room where you can speak with him privately.

(2 Kings 9:3) 
Then take the flask of oil and pour it over his head, saying, 'This is what the Lord declares: I have anointed you king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee quickly, and do not stay there.

(2 Kings 9:4) 
So the young prophet departed for Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:5) 
When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting together. The prophet said, 'I have a message for you, commander.' Jehu asked, 'For which of us, among all of us here?' And he answered, 'For you, commander.'

(2 Kings 9:6) 
So Jehu got up and went into the inner room. The prophet then poured the oil over his head and declared, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.

(2 Kings 9:7) 
You are to strike down the house of Ahab, your master. I will avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord’s servants who were murdered by Jezebel.'

(2 Kings 9:8) 
Indeed, I will destroy the entire house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male descendant, both slave and free, in Israel.

(2 Kings 9:9) 
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.

(2 Kings 9:10) 
And as for Jezebel, dogs will devour her in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her body.

(2 Kings 9:11) 
Then the young prophet opened the door and fled, just as Elisha had commanded him.

(2 Kings 9:12) 
When Jehu came out to his master’s servants, they asked him, 'Is everything well? Why did this madman come to you?' He replied to them, 'You know the man and what he might say.'

(2 Kings 9:13) 
But they insisted, 'No, that is not true; tell us instead!' So he told them, 'He said to me exactly this: 'This is what the Lord declares: I have anointed you king over Israel.''

(2 Kings 9:14) 
Immediately, each of them quickly took off his cloak and spread it under Jehu’s feet, as if making a royal throne. Then they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, 'Jehu is now king!'

(2 Kings 9:15) 
So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram had been defending Ramoth-Gilead, along with all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria.

(2 Kings 9:16) 
King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Jehu then commanded, 'If it is agreeable to you, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'

(2 Kings 9:17) 
So Jehu mounted his chariot and headed for Jezreel, because Joram was convalescing there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had come down to visit him.

(2 Kings 9:18) 
Now, the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw Jehu’s company approaching in their chariots. He called out, 'I see chariots coming!' Joram said, 'Send a horseman to meet them and ask if they come in peace.'

(2 Kings 9:19) 
So a horseman went out to meet him and asked, 'The king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!' The watchman reported, 'The messenger reached them, but he is not returning.'

(2 Kings 9:20) 
Then Joram sent a second horseman, who came to them and asked, 'The king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'' And Jehu answered, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!'

(2 Kings 9:21) 
The watchman reported again, saying, 'He reached them, but he is not returning. The way the chariot is being driven is like the furious driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he drives with great speed.'

(2 Kings 9:22) 
Then Joram exclaimed, 'Prepare my chariot!' So they prepared his chariot. King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots, and they rode to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.

(2 Kings 9:23) 
When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Do you come in peace, Jehu?' He replied, 'How can there be peace, as long as the many immoral acts and sorceries of your mother Jezebel are still thriving?'

(2 Kings 9:24) 
Joram then quickly turned his chariot to flee and shouted to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah! It’s an ambush!'

(2 Kings 9:25) 
But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced through his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.

(2 Kings 9:26) 
Jehu then said to Bidkar, his aide, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding together in a chariot behind Ahab, your father? The Lord then laid this prophecy as a burden upon him, saying:'

(2 Kings 9:27) 
'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, says the Lord, and I will repay you in this very field, says the Lord.' Now therefore, pick him up and throw him into the field, fulfilling the word of the Lord.

(2 Kings 9:28) 
When Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and commanded, 'Strike this one down too!' And they struck him down in his chariot on the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He then escaped to Megiddo and died there.

(2 Kings 9:29) 
His servants took his body in a chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.

(2 Kings 9:30) 
Jehu then arrived in Jezreel. When Jezebel heard of his arrival, she painted her eyes with kohl, adorned her head, and looked out from a window.

(2 Kings 9:31) 
As Jehu entered the city gate, Jezebel called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?' —comparing him to a previous king who assassinated his lord.

(2 Kings 9:32) 
Jehu looked up to the window and called out, 'Who is on my side? Who?' And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.

(2 Kings 9:33) 
He said to them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and her body was trampled underfoot.

(2 Kings 9:34) 
Then Jehu went inside, ate, and drank. Afterward, he commanded, 'Go now and see to that cursed woman, and bury her, for after all, she was a king’s daughter.'

(2 Kings 9:35) 
But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

(2 Kings 9:36) 
So they returned and reported this to him. Jehu then declared, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the territory of Jezreel, dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.'

(2 Kings 9:37) 
And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one will be able to identify her and say, 'This was Jezebel.'

(2 Kings 9:38)

(2 Kings 9:40)

(2 Kings 9:1) 
Now, Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and told him: "Prepare yourself for a journey, take this small flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead."

(2 Kings 9:2) 
When you arrive there, you will see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go inside, call him away from his companions, and bring him into an inner room.

(2 Kings 9:3) 
Then, take the flask of oil, pour it over his head, and say: "This is what the Lord says: 'I have anointed you king over Israel.'" Then, open the door, flee immediately, and do not delay.

(2 Kings 9:4) 
So the young prophet went to Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:5) 
He arrived and went in to the commanders of the army, and Jehu was sitting among them. The prophet said, "I have a message for you, commander." Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" The prophet replied, "For you, commander."

(2 Kings 9:6) 
So Jehu stood up and went into the inner room. The prophet then poured the oil over his head and declared: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I have anointed you king over the Lord's people, Israel.'"

(2 Kings 9:7) 
"And you will strike down the house of Ahab, your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord’s servants, from the hand of Jezebel."

(2 Kings 9:8) 
"I will utterly destroy the entire house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, the last person remaining in Israel."

(2 Kings 9:9) 
"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah."

(2 Kings 9:10) 
"As for Jezebel, dogs will eat her flesh in the field of Jezreel, and no one will bury her." Then the prophet opened the door and fled.

(2 Kings 9:11) 
Jehu then went out to the servants of his master. They asked him, "Is everything alright? Why did that madman come to you?" He replied to them, "You know the man and what he said."

(2 Kings 9:12) 
But they insisted, "That's not true! Tell us what he really said!" So he told them, "He said to me such and such, and then he declared, 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.'"

(2 Kings 9:13) 
So they immediately rushed, and each man took his cloak, spread it under Jehu's feet like a royal carpet, and sounded the trumpet, proclaiming, "Jehu is king!"

(2 Kings 9:14) 
Thus, Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now, Joram had been defending Ramoth-Gilead, along with all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria.)

(2 Kings 9:15) 
King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received from the Syrians while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Jehu then said, "If you agree with my plan, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel."

(2 Kings 9:16) 
Jehu then mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was recovering there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had come down to visit Joram.

(2 Kings 9:17) 
The lookout who was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel saw Jehu's chariot approaching and reported, "I see a chariot coming!" Joram said, "It's still far off. Send a messenger to meet him and ask: 'Is all well?'"

(2 Kings 9:18) 
So the messenger went to meet him and said, "The king asks: 'Is all well?'" Jehu replied, "What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!" The lookout reported again, saying, "The messenger reached them, but he is not returning."

(2 Kings 9:19) 
Joram then sent a second chariot with horses, and this messenger also reached them and asked, "The king asks: 'Is all well?'" Jehu again replied, "What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!"

(2 Kings 9:20) 
The lookout reported again, saying, "He reached them and is not returning. The driving is like the driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously."

(2 Kings 9:21) 
Joram said, "Harness my chariot!" So they harnessed his chariot, and King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots. They rode to meet Jehu and found him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.

(2 Kings 9:22) 
When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is all well, Jehu?" But Jehu responded, "How can there be peace, as long as the many idolatries and sorceries of your mother Jezebel continue to thrive?"

(2 Kings 9:23) 
Joram immediately turned his chariot around and fled, shouting to Ahaziah, "Treason, Ahaziah!"

(2 Kings 9:24) 
Then Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.

(2 Kings 9:25) 
Jehu then said to Bidkar, his officer, "Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding together in a chariot behind Ahab, this man's father, that the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying:"

(2 Kings 9:26) 
"'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, says the Lord, and I will repay you in this very field.' Therefore, pick him up now and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord."

(2 Kings 9:27) 
King Ahaziah of Judah, seeing this, fled by way of the garden house. But Jehu pursued him and commanded, "Strike him down also in his chariot!" So they struck him down on the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He managed to flee to Megiddo, but he died there.

(2 Kings 9:28) 
His servants then placed him in his own chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.

(2 Kings 9:29) 
In the eleventh year of Joram, son of Ahab, Ahaziah began his reign over Judah.

(2 Kings 9:30) 
Jehu then arrived in Jezreel. When Jezebel heard of his coming, she put on her eye makeup, adorned her head, and looked out of the window.

(2 Kings 9:31) 
As Jehu entered through the gate, she called out, "Is it peace, you Zimri, who murdered his master?"

(2 Kings 9:32) 
Jehu then looked up toward the window and asked, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.

(2 Kings 9:33) 
He commanded them, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and she was trampled underfoot.

(2 Kings 9:34) 
Jehu then went inside to eat and drink. Afterward, he said, "Go, inspect the body of that cursed woman and bury her, because after all, she was a king's daughter."

(2 Kings 9:35) 
But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

(2 Kings 9:36) 
They returned and reported this to him. Jehu said, "This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the field of Jezreel, dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel.'"

(2 Kings 9:37) 
"And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those who pass by will say, 'Is this really that Jezebel?'"

(2 Kings 9:1) 
Elisha the prophet called one of the prophets' disciples and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for travel, take this flask of anointing oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.'

(2 Kings 9:2) 
When you arrive there, look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the grandson of Nimshi. Go in, close the door of the room securely, take him aside from his companions, and lead him into a private, inner room.

(2 Kings 9:3) 
Then take the flask of anointing oil and pour it over his head, saying, 'The Lord declares this: I have anointed you as king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee immediately, and do not wait there for anything.

(2 Kings 9:4) 
So the young man, the prophet's servant, went to Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:5) 
He entered the room where the army commanders were gathered. Jehu was sitting among his fellow officers. The young man said, 'I have a message for you, commander.'

(2 Kings 9:6) 
Jehu asked, 'For which one of us?' The young man replied, 'For you, commander.'

(2 Kings 9:7) 
Jehu stood up and went into the private room. There, the young prophet poured the oil over his head and declared, 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I have anointed you as king over the Lord's people, over Israel.'

(2 Kings 9:8) 
You must strike down the household of Ahab your master. Through your hand, I will avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord's servants, against Jezebel.

(2 Kings 9:9) 
I will utterly destroy the entire household of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel.

(2 Kings 9:10) 
I will make the household of Ahab like the household of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the household of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.

(2 Kings 9:11) 
And as for Jezebel, dogs will devour her in the field of Jezreel, and there will be no one to bury her.' After saying this, the young prophet opened the door and fled.

(2 Kings 9:12) 
When Jehu returned to his master's officers, they asked him, 'Is everything alright? Why did that madman come to you?'

(2 Kings 9:13) 
He replied to them, 'You know the man, and you know what he said.'

(2 Kings 9:14) 
But they said, 'Don't lie to us; tell us honestly.' So he told them, 'He said such and such to me, saying: "The Lord declares this: I have anointed you as king over Israel."'

(2 Kings 9:15) 
They quickly took each man's cloak and laid it beneath Jehu, like a royal carpet on a raised platform. Then they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, 'Jehu is king!'

(2 Kings 9:16) 
So Jehu plotted against Joram, Ahab's son, who was in Jezreel. Joram, along with all Israel, had been defending Ramoth-Gilead.

(2 Kings 9:17) 
Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from wounds inflicted by the Arameans when he fought against Hazael, the king of Aram. Jehu declared, 'If you are in agreement with me, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'

(2 Kings 9:18) 
Then Jehu mounted his chariot and rode to Jezreel, where King Joram was recuperating. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also come down to visit Joram.

(2 Kings 9:19) 
A watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu approaching with his company of men and exclaimed, 'I see a chariot approaching!' Joram said, 'Send a rider on horseback to meet them and ask, "Is it peace?"'

(2 Kings 9:20) 
So a horseman rode out to meet him and asked, 'The king asks, "Is it peace?"' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!' The watchman reported again, saying, 'The messenger reached them, but he is not returning.'

(2 Kings 9:21) 
So Joram sent out a second horseman. When he reached them, he asked, 'The king asks, "Is it peace?"' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!'

(2 Kings 9:22) 
The watchman reported, 'He reached them as well, but he is not returning. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi—he drives like a madman.'

(2 Kings 9:23) 
Joram then commanded, 'Harness my chariot!' So they harnessed his chariot. King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots, riding to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field that belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.

(2 Kings 9:24) 
When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Is it peace, Jehu?' Jehu replied, 'What peace can there be, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her many sorceries are still flourishing?'

(2 Kings 9:25) 
Joram immediately turned his chariot to flee and cried out to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah!'

(2 Kings 9:26) 
But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and struck Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced through his heart, and he collapsed instantly in his chariot.

(2 Kings 9:27) 
Then Jehu ordered Bidkar, his officer, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding in chariots behind Ahab, this man's father, how the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying:'

(2 Kings 9:28) 
'"Surely I have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, which was shed yesterday," declares the Lord. "And I will repay you in this very field," declares the Lord. Now, therefore, pick him up and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord.'

(2 Kings 9:29) 
King Ahaziah of Judah saw what happened and fled by way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and commanded, 'Strike him down in his chariot too!' So they struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He managed to escape to Megiddo, but he died there.

(2 Kings 9:30) 
His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.

(2 Kings 9:31) 
When Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard about his coming. She painted her eyelids with kohl, adorned her head with jewels, and looked out from a window.

(2 Kings 9:32) 
As Jehu entered the gate, she called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?'

(2 Kings 9:33) 
Jehu looked up toward the window and asked, 'Who is on my side? Who?' Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.

(2 Kings 9:34) 
He commanded them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses' hooves, and Jehu's chariot trampled over her.

(2 Kings 9:35) 
Then Jehu went inside, ate and drank. Afterward, he said, 'Go and see to that accursed woman's corpse and bury her, for she was a king's daughter.'

(2 Kings 9:36) 
But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.

(2 Kings 9:37) 
When they returned and reported this to Jehu, he said, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "In the field of Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh."

(2 Kings 9:38) 
And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those passing by will say: "Is this truly that Jezebel?"'

(2 Kings 9:39) 
For Jezebel will not be in the earth, nor will there be a place where she can be buried. Instead, her remains will be scattered in the plain of Jezreel like dung on the surface of the ground, so completely that no one will be able to recognize her remains.

(2 Kings 9:40) 
Thus, the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those passing by will say: 'Is this truly that Jezebel?' For she will not be in the earth, nor will there be a place where Jezebel can be buried. Instead, her remains will be scattered in the plain of Jezreel like dung on the surface of the ground, so completely that no one will be able to recognize her remains.

(2 Kings 10:1) 
Now King Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and dispatched them to Samaria, addressing them to the city's officials, its elders, and those who were responsible for raising Ahab's sons, with this message:

(2 Kings 10:2) 
"Since your lord's sons are with you, and you have chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons,

(2 Kings 10:3) 
choose the best and most capable among your lord's sons, and place him on his father's throne. Then, fight for the family and household of your lord."

(2 Kings 10:4) 
But the officials were terrified, and they said: "Look, two kings—King Joram and King Ahaziah—could not stand against him. How then can we possibly resist him?"

(2 Kings 10:5) 
So the royal steward, the city governor, the elders, and the guardians of the sons sent a message back to Jehu, saying: "We are your servants, and we will do whatever you command us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever you deem best."

(2 Kings 10:6) 
Then Jehu wrote to them a second time, saying: "If you are truly on my side and will obey me, then cut off the heads of your lord's sons, and come to meet me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now, the king's seventy sons were living with the city's leading men, who were raising them.

(2 Kings 10:7) 
When the letters reached them, they seized the king's sons and killed all seventy men. Then they placed their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.

(2 Kings 10:8) 
Then a messenger arrived and reported to Jehu, saying: "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." Jehu responded: "Arrange them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning."

(2 Kings 10:9) 
When Jehu went out the next morning, he stood before the people and declared: "You are innocent in this matter. Indeed, I conspired against my lord and killed him; that is my responsibility. But who is responsible for slaying all these seventy men?"

(2 Kings 10:10) 
Know therefore that not a single word spoken by the Lord against the house of Ahab has failed to come true. The Lord has accomplished what He declared through His servant Elijah."

(2 Kings 10:11) 
So Jehu struck down all who remained of Ahab's family and household in Jezreel, including all his leading men, his relatives, and his priests, until there was not a single person left from Ahab's line.

(2 Kings 10:12) 
Then Jehu rose up and departed, traveling to Samaria. As he came to the Shepherds' House on the way,

(2 Kings 10:13) 
he encountered the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah and asked them: "Who are you?" They replied: "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen."

(2 Kings 10:14) 
Jehu seized them and slaughtered forty-two men by the pit near the Shepherds' House, leaving not a single one alive.

(2 Kings 10:15) 
When Jehu departed from there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab. After greeting him, Jehu asked: "Is your heart as loyal to me as my heart is loyal to you and God's purpose?" Jehonadab answered: "It is." Then Jehu said: "If so, give me your hand." Jehonadab extended his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into his chariot.

(2 Kings 10:16) 
Jehu then said to him: "Come with me, and witness my zeal for the Lord." So Jehu brought him into his chariot.

(2 Kings 10:17) 
Upon entering Samaria, Jehu struck down all who remained of Ahab's family and household in that city, utterly destroying them, in fulfillment of the Lord's word spoken to Elijah.

(2 Kings 10:18) 
Then Jehu gathered all the people and declared to them: "Ahab served Baal only a little, but I will serve him much more diligently."

(2 Kings 10:19) 
Therefore, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests to me now. Let no one fail to come, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent will not live." Jehu was doing this with cunning intent, aiming to utterly destroy the worshippers of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:20) 
And Jehu commanded: "Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal!" So it was proclaimed throughout the land.

(2 Kings 10:21) 
Jehu also sent messengers throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came. Not a single one remained who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.

(2 Kings 10:22) 
Then Jehu said to the one in charge of the vestments: "Bring out the robes for all the servants of Baal." So the official brought out the robes for them.

(2 Kings 10:23) 
When Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, Jehu said to the Baal worshippers: "Look carefully and make sure there is no servant of the Lord among you, but only servants of Baal."

(2 Kings 10:24) 
Then the Baal worshippers proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Meanwhile, Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, warning them: "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands should escape, then your own life will be taken in exchange for his life."

(2 Kings 10:25) 
As soon as Jehu had finished offering the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers: "Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!" So the guards and officers struck them with the edge of the sword. Then they cast out the bodies and proceeded to the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:26) 
They brought out the sacred pillar of Baal from the temple of Baal and burned it.

(2 Kings 10:27) 
They also broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and completely tore down the temple of Baal. They turned it into a public latrine, and it remains so to this very day.

(2 Kings 10:28) 
Thus Jehu utterly eradicated Baal worship from Israel.

(2 Kings 10:29) 
However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, specifically from worshipping the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.

(2 Kings 10:30) 
Therefore, the Lord said to Jehu: "Because you have diligently carried out what was right and pleasing in My sight, and you have done everything I intended against the house of Ahab, your sons will sit on the throne of Israel for four generations."

(2 Kings 10:31) 
Yet Jehu himself was not careful to walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with his whole heart; for he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 10:32) 
In those days, the Lord began to diminish Israel. King Hazael of Aram struck them throughout all the territories of Israel,

(2 Kings 10:33) 
including all the land beyond the Jordan River—Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, including Gilead and Bashan.

(2 Kings 10:34) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he accomplished, and all his might, are these not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 10:35) 
Then Jehu rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king.

(2 Kings 10:36) 
The length of Jehu's reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.

(2 Kings 10:37) 
[Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]

(2 Kings 10:38) 
[Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]

[Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]

(2 Kings 10:40) 
[Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]

(2 Kings 10:1) 
Now, Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them into Samaria, to the city's most important officials, to its elders, and to those who had cared for Ahab's children since their youth, saying this:

(2 Kings 10:2) 
“As soon as you receive this letter—you who are responsible for your lord's sons, who have chariots and horses, who control fortified cities and weapons—

(2 Kings 10:3) 
choose the best and most capable among your lord's sons. Then put him on his father's throne and fight for the dynasty of your lord.”

(2 Kings 10:4) 
But they were terrified and said, “Look, two kings couldn't stand against him—referring to Jehu—so how can we possibly resist Jehu ourselves?”

(2 Kings 10:5) 
So the official in charge of the palace, along with the city's chief officials, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's sons, sent this message back to Jehu: “We are your servants. Whatever you command, we will do. We will not set up anyone as king. You may do whatever you think is right.”

(2 Kings 10:6) 
Jehu then wrote a second letter to them, saying: “If you truly are loyal to me and are ready to obey me, then take the heads of your lord's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now, the king's seventy sons were living with the most important officials of the city, who were raising them.

(2 Kings 10:7) 
When the officials received Jehu's letter, they seized the king's seventy sons and slaughtered every one of them. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.

(2 Kings 10:8) 
When a messenger came and reported to Jehu, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king's sons,” Jehu replied, “Pile them in two heaps by the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”

(2 Kings 10:9) 
In the morning, Jehu went out, stood before all the people, and declared: “Understand this now: None of you are guilty of this conspiracy to kill Joram, the son of Ahab; however, know that nothing of all the Lord's words spoken against the dynasty of Ahab has failed to come to pass. The Lord has truly done what he promised through his servant Elijah.”

(2 Kings 10:10) 
So then Jehu struck down all those who remained of Ahab's dynasty in Jezreel, along with all of Ahab's chief officials, his close associates, and his priests, until not a single person remained from his family line.

(2 Kings 10:11) 
Then Jehu got up and traveled to Samaria. On the way, when he reached a shepherd's hut,

(2 Kings 10:12) 
he found the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah. He asked them, “Who are you?” They answered, “We are the relatives of King Ahaziah, and we are on our way to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.”

(2 Kings 10:13) 
Jehu ordered, “Seize them alive!” And when they had seized them alive, he had them slaughtered by the roadside well—all forty-two men. He did not leave a single one of them alive.

(2 Kings 10:14) 
When Jehu left that place, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Is your heart as true to me as my heart is to yours?” Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu then said, “If it is, give me your hand.” So Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into his chariot with him.

(2 Kings 10:15) 
Then Jehu said to him, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” And he took Jehonadab into his chariot.

(2 Kings 10:16) 
When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he struck down everyone who remained from Ahab's dynasty in Samaria, until he had completely annihilated them. This was in accordance with the word of the Lord that he had spoken to Elijah.

(2 Kings 10:17) 
Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but I will serve him much more.”

(2 Kings 10:18) 
“Therefore, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests to me now. Let no one fail to come, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Anyone who is absent will not live.” Jehu was doing this with a cunning plan in mind, intending to utterly destroy the worshippers of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:19) 
And Jehu said, “Consecrate a solemn assembly for Baal!” So they proclaimed it.

(2 Kings 10:20) 
Jehu sent messengers throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one remained who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.

(2 Kings 10:21) 
Then Jehu said to the attendant who was in charge of the robes, “Bring out vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them.

(2 Kings 10:22) 
Jehu, along with Jehonadab son of Rechab, entered the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the worshippers of Baal, “Search carefully and make sure there is no servant of the Lord among you, but only worshippers of Baal.”

(2 Kings 10:23) 
Then they proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now, Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, saying to them, “If any of these men whom I bring into your hands escape, then the life of that guard will pay for the life of the one who escaped.”

(2 Kings 10:24) 
As soon as the burnt offering was completed, Jehu commanded his guards and officers, “Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!” So the guards and officers struck them down with the edge of the sword. They threw their bodies out and went into the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:25) 
They brought out the sacred pillar, or idol, from the temple of Baal and burned it.

(2 Kings 10:26) 
They then broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal itself. They turned it into a latrine, which it remains to this very day.

(2 Kings 10:27) 
Thus, Jehu eradicated Baal worship from Israel.

(2 Kings 10:28) 
Nevertheless, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin—namely, the worship of the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.

(2 Kings 10:29) 
Therefore, the Lord said to Jehu, “Because you have zealously carried out what was right in my sight, and have accomplished all that was in my heart concerning the dynasty of Ahab, your sons will sit on the throne of Israel for four generations.”

(2 Kings 10:30) 
However, Jehu himself did not carefully walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 10:31) 
In those days, the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel. King Hazael of Aram struck them throughout all the territory of Israel,

(2 Kings 10:32) 
starting from the Jordan River eastward, encompassing all the land of Gilead—the territories of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, including Gilead and Bashan.

(2 Kings 10:33) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 10:34) 
So Jehu rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Jehoahaz became king in his place.

(2 Kings 10:35) 
Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years.

(2 Kings 10:36) 
As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 10:37) 
Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Joash became king in his place, during the seventeenth year of the reign of King Joash of Judah.

(2 Kings 10:38) 
Amasias was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin, from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 10:39) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, though not with the complete devotion of his ancestor David. He followed the example of all that his father Joash had done.

(2 Kings 10:40) 
However, he did not remove the high places—the pagan altars—so the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. In those days, Amaziah sent messengers to King Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us meet face to face in battle.”

(2 Kings 10:1) 
Now, Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them into Samaria to the chief men of the city, to the elders, and to those who had been responsible for raising Ahab’s children. This is what he said:

(2 Kings 10:2) 
"As soon as you receive these letters—you who have the sons of your lord, and chariots, and horses, and cities, and weapons—choose the best and most pleasing of your lord’s sons. Then put him on his father’s throne and fight for your lord’s family."

(2 Kings 10:3) 
But they were terrified, and they said: "Look, two kings were not able to stand against him, so how can we resist?"

(2 Kings 10:4) 
Therefore, Jehu had already sent people to take charge of the household and the sons of Ahab. Indeed, Jehu himself had already killed all the chief men, all the elders, and those who had been responsible for raising Ahab’s children in Samaria.

(2 Kings 10:5) 
But then Jehu sent a second set of letters to them, saying: "If you are with me and obey me, then take the heads of Ahab’s sons and come to me tomorrow at this time in Jezreel." (The king’s seventy sons were living with the chief men of the city, who were raising them.)

(2 Kings 10:6) 
When these letters reached them, they seized the king’s sons and killed all seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.

(2 Kings 10:7) 
A messenger came and reported to Jehu, saying: "They have brought the heads of the king’s sons." Jehu replied: "Make them into two piles at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning."

(2 Kings 10:8) 
When morning came, Jehu went out and stood on the steps near the city gate. He said to all the people there: "You yourselves are innocent in this matter. Look, I conspired against my lord and killed him. But who then murdered all of these men?"

(2 Kings 10:9) 
"Understand now that not one word spoken by the Lord against Ahab’s house has fallen to the ground without being fulfilled. The Lord has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah."

(2 Kings 10:10) 
So Jehu then killed all those who remained of Ahab’s family in Jezreel—all of his chief men, his close acquaintances, and his priests—until he left not a single one alive.

(2 Kings 10:11) 
And Jehu rose up and left, going toward Samaria. When he came to the shepherd’s house on the road,

(2 Kings 10:12) 
He found the relatives of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, there and asked them: "Who are you?" They replied: "We are Ahaziah’s relatives, and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen."

(2 Kings 10:13) 
Jehu said: "Capture them alive!" So, when they had captured them alive, they slaughtered them—forty-two men—by the well near the house. Not a single one of them was left alive.

(2 Kings 10:14) 
When Jehu had gone from there, he met Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said to him: "Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?" Jehonadab replied: "It is true, indeed! If it is, then give me your hand." So Jehu gave him his hand, and Jehu lifted him up into his chariot.

(2 Kings 10:15) 
And Jehu said to him: "Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord." So he had Jehonadab sit in his chariot with him.

(2 Kings 10:16) 
When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed all who remained of Ahab’s family in Samaria, until not one was left. This was according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Elijah.

(2 Kings 10:17) 
Then Jehu took a priest of Baal and said to them: "Summon all the servants of Baal for me—all of his priests and all of his prophets. No one is to be absent, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever fails to come will not live." Jehu was doing this cunningly, intending to destroy the worshippers of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:18) 
And Jehu announced this throughout all Samaria.

(2 Kings 10:19) 
And Jehu announced throughout all Israel, saying: "Consecrate a solemn day for Baal!" He proclaimed it, and all the servants of Baal gathered together. Not a single one remained who did not come.

(2 Kings 10:20) 
And they entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.

(2 Kings 10:21) 
And Jehu said to those who were in charge of the vestments: "Bring out robes for all the servants of Baal." So they brought out the robes for them.

(2 Kings 10:22) 
Then Jehu, along with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, entered the temple of Baal. He said to the worshippers of Baal: "Search carefully and make sure that none of the Lord’s servants are among you, but only the servants of Baal."

(2 Kings 10:23) 
And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. But Jehu had placed one hundred men outside, telling them: "Whoever allows any of the men whom I deliver into your hands to escape, his life will pay for that man’s life."

(2 Kings 10:24) 
And it came to pass that when the offering of the burnt offering was completed, Jehu commanded his guards and his commanders: "Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!" So they struck them down with the edge of the sword, threw out their bodies, and then went into the inner city of the temple of Baal.

(2 Kings 10:25) 
And they brought out the statue from the temple of Baal and burned it.

(2 Kings 10:26) 
And they smashed the statue of Baal into pieces and utterly destroyed its temple, turning it into latrines, right up to the present day.

(2 Kings 10:27) 
So Jehu completely eradicated Baal worship from Israel.

(2 Kings 10:28) 
Nevertheless, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. He did not abandon the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.

(2 Kings 10:29) 
And the Lord said to Jehu: "Because you have diligently done what was right and pleasing in My eyes, and have carried out everything that was in My heart against the house of Ahab, your sons will sit upon the throne of Israel for four generations."

(2 Kings 10:30) 
However, Jehu did not carefully observe walking in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart. For he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 10:31) 
In those days, the Lord began to be disgusted with Israel. He allowed Hazael to strike them in all the territories of Israel,

(2 Kings 10:32) 
From the Jordan River eastward, he struck all the land of Gilead, and Gad, and Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the torrent of Arnon, including Gilead, and Bashan.

(2 Kings 10:33) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 10:34) 
So Jehu rested with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 10:35) 
Now, the days that Jehu reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria.

(2 Kings 10:36) 
And Jehu rested with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 11:1) 
Athalia, the mother of Ochozias, saw that her son was dead. She then rose up and ordered the killing of all the royal offspring.

(2 Kings 11:2) 
However, Iosaba, daughter of King Ioram and sister of Ochozias, took Ioas, the son of Ochozias. She secretly removed him from among the king’s sons who were being slaughtered. She gave him to his nurse in the treasury chamber, and they hid him from Athalia to prevent his murder.

(2 Kings 11:3) 
Ioas was hidden with her in the Temple of the Lord for six years. During this time, Athalia reigned over the land.

(2 Kings 11:4) 
In the seventh year, Ioiada sent for the centurions and soldiers, bringing them to him in the Temple of the Lord. He made a solemn covenant with them, imposing an oath on them in the Temple of the Lord, and then revealed the king’s son to them.

(2 Kings 11:5) 
He commanded them, saying: “This is the instruction you must follow: A third of you are to enter on the Sabbath and guard the royal palace.”

(2 Kings 11:6) 
“A third of you will stand guard at the Sur Gate. And a third of you will be at the gate beyond the armor-bearers’ chariots. You are to maintain watch over the palace and prevent any attack.”

(2 Kings 11:7) 
“The other two parts of your company, all those whose Sabbath shift is ending, are to guard the Temple of the Lord around the king.”

(2 Kings 11:8) 
“You are to surround him, with your weapons in your hands. If anyone enters the Temple precincts without permission, they are to be killed. You will be with the king both when he enters and when he leaves.”

(2 Kings 11:9) 
The centurions carried out all that Ioiada the priest had commanded them. Each one gathered his men—those whose Sabbath shift was beginning and those whose shift was ending—and they came to Ioiada the priest.

(2 Kings 11:10) 
The priest then gave them the weapons and shields of King David, which had been stored in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:11) 
Each man stood with his weapons in hand, forming a line from the right side of the Temple to the left side of the altar and the Temple itself, surrounding the king.

(2 Kings 11:12) 
Ioiada brought out the king’s son and placed the royal crown upon him, along with a copy of the Law to signify his covenant with God. They made him king and anointed him. Then, clapping their hands, they shouted: “Long live the king!”

(2 Kings 11:13) 
Athalia, meanwhile, heard the sound of the people running and praising the new king. She went to the people in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:14) 
She saw the king standing on the royal platform, as was customary, with the singers and trumpeters near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. She tore her garments and cried out: “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!”

(2 Kings 11:15) 
But Ioiada the priest commanded the centurions and those in charge of the army, saying: “Lead her outside the Temple precincts. Anyone who follows her is to be killed by the sword.” The priest had given this order because he said: “She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord.”

(2 Kings 11:16) 
So they seized her, and when she reached the path of the Horse Gate, near the royal palace, they killed her there.

(2 Kings 11:17) 
Ioiada then made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, establishing that they would be the Lord’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people, defining their mutual obligations.

(2 Kings 11:18) 
All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and destroyed it. They utterly shattered its altars and idols. They also killed Mathan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Then the priest stationed guards in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:19) 
He then took the centurions, the Carians, the royal guards, and all the people of the land. They led the king from the Temple of the Lord and entered the palace through the Gate of the Guards. Ioas then took his seat on the royal throne.

(2 Kings 11:20) 
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city became peaceful. Athalia had been killed by the sword at the royal palace.

(2 Kings 11:21) 
Ioas was seven years old when he began to reign.

(2 Kings 11:22) 
In the seventh year of Iehu’s reign, Ioas began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Ierusalem. His mother’s name was Sebia, from Bersabee.

(2 Kings 11:23) 
Ioas did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days that Ioiada the priest guided him.

(2 Kings 11:24) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.

(2 Kings 11:25) 
Ioas said to the priests: “All the consecrated money that is brought to the Temple of the Lord by passersby—including money offered as atonement for a soul or dedicated by a personal vow, and whatever money people freely and willingly bring to the Temple of the Lord—

(2 Kings 11:26) 
let each priest receive it from his designated collectors, and with it, let them repair the deterioration of the Temple whenever they find anything broken or in disrepair.”

(2 Kings 11:27) 
But by the twenty-third year of King Ioas, the priests still had not repaired the deterioration of the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:28) 
So King Ioas summoned Ioiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: “Why have you not repaired the deterioration of the Temple? From now on, you are not to receive money from your collectors, but instead, you must hand it over directly for the Temple’s restoration.”

(2 Kings 11:29) 
Thus, the priests were forbidden from then on to receive money from the people and from overseeing the repair of the Temple’s deterioration themselves.

(2 Kings 11:30) 
Ioiada the high priest took a single chest, cut a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side of those entering the Temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the doors would put all the money brought to the Temple of the Lord into it.

(2 Kings 11:31) 
Whenever they saw that the chest was full, the king’s scribe and the high priest would go up. They would empty it and count the money that had been collected in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:32) 
They would then give the money, according to its counted sum and measure, into the hands of those overseeing the work, and to the carpenters, builders, and stonemasons who were to repair the Temple’s deterioration.

(2 Kings 11:33) 
It was also given to those who bought wood and cut stones to repair the damage to the Temple of the Lord, and for all other expenses required for the work of restoring the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:34) 
Nevertheless, silver bowls, pitchers, cups, trumpets, or any gold and silver vessels were not made in the Temple of the Lord from the money that was brought in.

(2 Kings 11:35) 
Instead, the money was given solely to those performing the work, so that they could use it to repair the deterioration of the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:36) 
No accounting was required from the men who were given the money to distribute to the workmen and carpenters, because they acted with complete trustworthiness.

(2 Kings 11:37) 
However, the money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not put into the Temple treasury; it belonged to the priests.

(2 Kings 11:38) 
At that time, Azahel, the king of Syria, advanced and fought against Geth, capturing it. He then turned his attention towards Ierusalem, intending to attack it.

(2 Kings 11:39) 
For this reason, Ioas, king of Iuda, took all the consecrated items that Iosaphat, Ioram, and Ochozias—his ancestors and kings of Iuda—had dedicated, along with his own offerings. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasury of the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasury. He sent all this to King Azahel of Syria, who then turned away from Ierusalem.

(2 Kings 11:40) 
The rest of the acts of Ioas, and all that he did, are they not indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iuda?

(2 Kings 11:1) 
When Athalia, the mother of Ochozias, saw that her son was dead, she rose up and killed all the royal offspring.

(2 Kings 11:2) 
However, Josaba—daughter of King Joram and sister of Ochozias—took Joas, the son of Ochozias, and secretly rescued him from among the other royal children who were being murdered. She hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, away from Athalia, and so he was not killed.

(2 Kings 11:3) 
So Joas was hidden with her in the Lord's Temple for six years, while Athalia reigned over the land.

(2 Kings 11:4) 
But in the seventh year, Joiada sent for the centurions and soldiers and brought them to him in the Lord's Temple. There he made a covenant with them, and after administering an oath in the Lord's Temple, he showed them the king's son.

(2 Kings 11:5) 
And he commanded them, saying, 'This is what you shall do: a third of you will come on the Sabbath and guard the king's palace.'

(2 Kings 11:6) 
Another third will guard the Sur Gate. And the final third will guard the inner gate, where the shield-bearers usually run their course. You will take turns guarding the Temple complex.

(2 Kings 11:7) 
And two other groups of you, all who typically go off duty on the Sabbath, are to guard the Lord's Temple around the king.

(2 Kings 11:8) 
Surround the king, with each man having his weapons in hand. Anyone who tries to break through your ranks is to be killed. You are to stay with the king both when he enters and when he exits.

(2 Kings 11:9) 
So the centurions did everything that Joiada the high priest had commanded them. Each centurion gathered his men, both those whose shift was beginning on the Sabbath and those whose shift was ending, and they came to Joiada the high priest.

(2 Kings 11:10) 
Then the high priest gave them the spears and the weapons of King David that were stored in the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 11:11) 
Then each man, with weapons in hand, took his position around the king, from the right side of the Temple all the way to the left side, encompassing both the altar and the Temple itself.

(2 Kings 11:12) 
Then Joiada brought out the king's son and placed the royal crown upon him, along with the Testimony (the law of the covenant). They proclaimed him king and anointed him. Then, clapping their hands, they all shouted, 'Long live the King!'

(2 Kings 11:13) 
When Athalia heard the shouts of the people running about, she came to the people in the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 11:14) 
She saw the new king standing on the platform according to custom, with the singers and trumpeters beside him. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So she tore her clothes and cried out, 'Treason! Treason!'

(2 Kings 11:15) 
Joiada then commanded the centurions who were in charge of the army, saying, 'Bring her out beyond the Temple precincts, and anyone who follows her is to be killed with the sword.' For the high priest had declared, 'Let her not be killed in the Lord's Temple.'

(2 Kings 11:16) 
So they seized her and led her out through the entrance for horses, next to the palace, and there she was put to death.

(2 Kings 11:17) 
Then Joiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, establishing them as the Lord's own people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.

(2 Kings 11:18) 
Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and utterly demolished it. They smashed its altars and images into tiny pieces. They also killed Mathan, the priest of Baal, right in front of the altars.

(2 Kings 11:19) 
Joiada then appointed officers over the Lord's Temple, placing them under the authority of the priests and Levites, each performing his service in his assigned role within the Lord's house. This was to oversee the burnt offerings and peace offerings, according to the commandment of David, as it is written in the Book of Moses, and to perform these duties with joy and singing.

(2 Kings 11:20) 
Then Joiada, accompanied by the centurions, the mighty men, the leaders of the people, and all the common people of the land, led the new king from the Lord's Temple. They entered the palace through the Horse Gate, and the king took his seat upon the royal throne.

(2 Kings 11:21) 
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city finally found peace. Athalia had been killed by the sword at the king's palace.

(2 Kings 11:1) 
Athaliah, who was the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead. So she rose up and killed all the royal offspring.

(2 Kings 11:2) 
But Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, took Ahaziah's son, Joash. She secretly took him from among the king's children who were being killed. She gave him to his nurse in a hidden bedroom, so that he would not be killed by Athaliah.

(2 Kings 11:3) 
He remained hidden with her in the house of the Lord for six years. During this time, Athaliah reigned over the land as queen.

(2 Kings 11:4) 
In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the centurions and the soldiers. He brought them to him in the Temple of the Lord. He made a covenant with them there and swore them to an oath in the Temple of the Lord. Then he showed them the king's son, Joash.

(2 Kings 11:5) 
He commanded them, saying, "This is what you are to do: One-third of you, those who are entering on duty for the Sabbath, shall guard the royal palace."

(2 Kings 11:6) 
"Another third of you shall be at the Sur Gate. And the final third shall be at the gate behind the guardhouse. You will all keep watch over the palace building."

(2 Kings 11:7) 
"The other two divisions of you, all who are going off duty on the Sabbath, shall guard the Temple of the Lord around the king."

(2 Kings 11:8) 
"You shall surround the king, with each man having his weapons in his hands. If anyone tries to enter the inner courts, he shall be killed. You are to remain with the king as he enters and leaves."

(2 Kings 11:9) 
So the centurions did everything that Jehoiada the priest had commanded them. Each one took his men, those who were entering duty on the Sabbath, along with those who were going off duty from the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest.

(2 Kings 11:10) 
The priest then gave them spears and the weapons of King David, which were kept in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:11) 
The men stood, each with his weapons in his hands. They formed a line from the right side of the Temple to the left side, by the altar, the Temple itself, and all around the king.

(2 Kings 11:12) 
Then Jehoiada brought out the king's son. He placed the royal crown on him and presented him with the testimony, which was the covenant scroll. They made him king and anointed him with oil. They clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"

(2 Kings 11:13) 
When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she entered the Temple of the Lord where the people were.

(2 Kings 11:14) 
She saw the king standing by the pillar, as was the custom, with the singers and trumpeters near him. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So she tore her clothes and cried out, "Treason! Treason!"

(2 Kings 11:15) 
Jehoiada commanded the centurions who were in charge of the army. He told them, "Bring her out beyond the Temple courts. And whoever follows her, let him be killed by the sword." For the priest had said, "She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord."

(2 Kings 11:16) 
So they seized her. She went out through the Horse Gate, which was near the royal palace, and she was killed there.

(2 Kings 11:17) 
Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, so that they would be the Lord's people. He also established a covenant between the king and the people.

(2 Kings 11:18) 
All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and destroyed it. They smashed its altars and its idols into pieces, completely destroying them. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of his altar. Then the priest Jehoiada appointed guards over the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:19) 
Jehoiada took the centurions, the Carites (a foreign mercenary guard), the royal guards, and all the people of the land. They brought the king down from the Temple of the Lord. They entered the palace by way of the royal guard's gate, and he sat on the throne of the kings.

(2 Kings 11:20) 
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet and at peace. Athaliah, however, had been killed by the sword in the royal palace.

(2 Kings 11:21) 
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.

(2 Kings 11:22) 
In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, from Beersheba.

(2 Kings 11:23) 
Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

(2 Kings 11:24) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places—these were the local places of worship outside Jerusalem. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on these high places.

(2 Kings 11:25) 
Joash said to the priests, "All the money that is brought into the Temple of the Lord for sacred purposes by those who pass through—the money paid for a person's life, and any money that people freely and willingly bring to the Temple of the Lord—"

(2 Kings 11:26) 
"Let the priests receive it, each from his own district, and let them repair the damages of the Temple building wherever they find a breach or a gap."

(2 Kings 11:27) 
However, by the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had still not repaired the damages of the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:28) 
So King Joash called for Jehoiada the chief priest and the other priests. He asked them, "Why are you not repairing the damages of the Temple? From now on, you shall not receive money from the people for yourselves. Instead, you must hand it over directly for the Temple repairs."

(2 Kings 11:29) 
The priests were then forbidden to receive money from the people for their own use and were tasked only with repairing the breaches of the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:30) 
Jehoiada the chief priest took one chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one entered the Temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance would put into it all the money that was brought to the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:31) 
When they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the chief priest would go up. They would empty it and count the money that was found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:32) 
They would then give the counted money to the supervisors of the masons, the builders, and the stonecutters, who were restoring the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:33) 
They gave it to those who cut stones and to the quarrymen. It was also used to buy wood and cut stones, so that the entire Temple of the Lord could be restored wherever there were damages. This money was spent specifically for the restoration of the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:34) 
However, no silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any other vessels of gold or silver were made for the Temple of the Lord from the money brought into the Temple.

(2 Kings 11:35) 
Instead, that money was given to those who performed the work, so that they could use it to restore the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:36) 
No accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute to the workmen and the laborers, because they were considered trustworthy.

(2 Kings 11:37) 
The money from trespass offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the Lord, because that money belonged to the priests.

(2 Kings 11:38) 
At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, came up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching against Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 11:39) 
Because of this threat, King Joash of Judah took all the sacred gifts that his fathers—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—had consecrated. He also took his own consecrated gifts, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord and in the royal palace treasury. He sent all these to King Hazael of Syria. In exchange for these treasures, Hazael turned his army away from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 11:40) 
Now, as for the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 11:1) 
Athalia, the mother of Ahaziah, heard that her son was dead. She then rose up and ordered the killing of all who were of the royal lineage, to eliminate all potential heirs to the throne.

(2 Kings 11:2) 
But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, rescued Ahaziah's son, Joash, by secretly taking him from among the other royal children who were being murdered. She gave him to his nurse in a hidden room away from Athalia, and so he was not killed.

(2 Kings 11:3) 
Joash remained hidden with her in the house of the Lord, the Temple, for six years, all while Athalia was ruling over the land.

(2 Kings 11:4) 
Then, in the seventh year of Athalia's reign, Jehoiada the high priest sent for the captains of hundreds and the soldiers. He brought them to himself in the Temple of the Lord, made a solemn covenant with them, and after making them swear an oath in the Temple, he showed them the king’s son, Joash.

(2 Kings 11:5) 
Jehoiada then commanded them, saying: “These are your instructions: a third of your men, those who are coming on duty for the Sabbath, shall go into the palace and guard the king’s residence.

(2 Kings 11:6) 
Another third of you will stand guard at the Sur Gate, and the final third will be at the gate behind the guards' barracks. You must keep watch over the Temple to ensure it is not breached.”

(2 Kings 11:7) 
“As for the other two parts of your men, all who are going off duty on the Sabbath, they shall guard the Lord's Temple and surround the king.

(2 Kings 11:8) 
You shall form a protective circle around the king, with your weapons ready in your hands. If anyone attempts to enter your lines, they are to be killed. You are to remain with the king, protecting him whenever he enters or leaves.”

(2 Kings 11:9) 
The captains of hundreds carried out all the orders given to them by Jehoiada the priest. Each officer took command of his incoming men, those who were starting their Sabbath duty, and his outgoing men, those who were finishing their Sabbath duty, and they all assembled before Jehoiada the priest.

(2 Kings 11:10) 
Then Jehoiada the priest equipped them, giving them spears and the weapons of King David that had been kept in the Lord's Temple treasury.

(2 Kings 11:11) 
Each man took his position with weapons in hand, forming a perimeter from the right side of the Temple all the way to the left side of the altar and the main Temple building, surrounding the king.

(2 Kings 11:12) 
Then Jehoiada brought out the king's son, Joash, and placed the royal crown upon him. He also presented him with a copy of God’s Law, symbolizing his covenant with God and his duty to rule justly. They then proclaimed him king and anointed him with oil. The people clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”

(2 Kings 11:13) 
Athalia heard the noise of the people running and praising the new king. She went to where the people were, entering into the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 11:14) 
There she saw the young king standing on the royal platform, as was the custom. The Temple singers were there, with trumpeters nearby, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and sounding their trumpets. Athalia tore her royal robes in distress and cried out, “Conspiracy! Treason!”

(2 Kings 11:15) 
Jehoiada the priest then gave orders to the captains of the army: “Lead her out from the Temple grounds, and anyone who follows her is to be killed by the sword.” The priest had given this instruction because he did not want her to be put to death in the sacred house of the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:16) 
So they seized her and led her out through the Horse Gate, which led to the royal palace, and there she was executed.

(2 Kings 11:17) 
So Jehoiada formally established a covenant between the Lord, the new king, and the people, confirming that the nation would again wholeheartedly belong to the Lord.

(2 Kings 11:18) 
Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and utterly destroyed it, along with its altars and idols, which they thoroughly smashed. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, right in front of his altars. Jehoiada the priest then placed guards over the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 11:19) 
Jehoiada then led the captains, the Carite guards, the royal footmen, and all the people of the land, bringing the king from the Temple of the Lord. They entered the palace through the main guard gate, and Joash then sat upon the royal throne, taking his rightful place as king.

(2 Kings 11:20) 
All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city finally found peace and quiet. Athalia had been put to death by the sword near the king's palace, ending her reign of terror.

(2 Kings 11:21) 
Joash was seven years old when he began his reign as king.

(2 Kings 12:1) 
In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joas began to reign as king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem, the capital city. His mother's name was Sebia, and she was from the city of Bersabee.

(2 Kings 12:2) 
And Joas did what was right in the sight of the Lord during all the days that Jojada the high priest instructed and guided him.

(2 Kings 12:3) 
Nevertheless, King Joas did not tear down the high places of worship outside of Jerusalem, so the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these unauthorized shrines.

(2 Kings 12:4) 
King Joas then said to the priests: "Collect all the money from the holy offerings that is brought into the Lord's Temple. This includes money from visitors, from those who pay the redemption tax for their lives, and whatever people willingly and freely bring to the Lord's Temple from their hearts."

(2 Kings 12:5) 
"The priests are to receive this money, each from his own assigned collection point. Then they are to use it to repair any damage they find in the Temple structure, wherever they see a need for restoration."

(2 Kings 12:6) 
However, up to the twenty-third year of King Joas's reign, the priests still had not completed the repairs on the Temple structure.

(2 Kings 12:7) 
So King Joas called for Jojada the high priest and the other priests and demanded of them: "Why have you not repaired the damages of the Temple? From now on, you are not to keep this money for yourselves. Instead, you must give it directly for the repairs of the Temple."

(2 Kings 12:8) 
Therefore, the priests were forbidden from accepting money from the people for their own use, and they were also no longer solely responsible for directing the repairs of the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:9) 
Then Jojada the high priest took a single chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, to the right of those entering the Lord's Temple. And the priests who guarded the entrance deposited all the money that was brought to the Lord's Temple directly into this chest.

(2 Kings 12:10) 
Whenever the Temple officials saw that a large amount of money had accumulated in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go up. They would empty the chest and count the money that had been collected for the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 12:11) 
They then gave the counted money directly into the hands of those who supervised the work, and to the carpenters and the masons they had hired, who were responsible for repairing the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:12) 
They also paid the timber merchants and stonecutters for purchasing stone and timber, and for all other expenses related to restoring the damages of the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:13) 
Nevertheless, out of the money brought into the Lord's Temple, no silver basins, tongs, bowls, trumpets, or any other vessels of gold or silver were made for use in the Temple rituals.

(2 Kings 12:14) 
Instead, the money was given only to those who were doing the work, so that they could use it to repair the damages of the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:15) 
They did not require an accounting from the men who received the money to pay the workers, because they entrusted it to them in good faith.

(2 Kings 12:16) 
However, the money from sin offerings and guilt offerings was not brought into the Lord's Temple chest, because that money belonged to the priests for their sustenance.

(2 Kings 12:17) 
At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, marched up and fought against the city of Geth and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching up against Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:18) 
Because of this threat, Joas, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, the kings of Judah—Josaphat, Joram, and Ochozias—had dedicated to the Lord, along with his own offerings, and all the gold that could be found in the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and in the king's palace. He sent all of this as a tribute to Hazael, the king of Syria, and Hazael then turned away from attacking Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:19) 
Are not the rest of the deeds of Joas, and all that he accomplished, recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 12:20) 
However, his own servants rose up and conspired against him. They struck down Joas in the house of Mello, which is on the road that goes down to Sella.

(2 Kings 12:21) 
Josachar, the son of Semaath, and Jozabad, the son of Somer, his own servants, struck him down, and he died. They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Amasias then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 12:1) 
In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, from Beersheba.

(2 Kings 12:2) 
Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord throughout all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

(2 Kings 12:3) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.

(2 Kings 12:4) 
Joash said to the priests: "All the money that is brought into the temple of the Lord from those who pass through—money consecrated to God, that is given as a vow, or that anyone willingly offers—and brought into the temple of the Lord:"

(2 Kings 12:5) 
"Let the priests receive it according to their assigned duty, and let them repair the damages of the temple, wherever they find anything broken."

(2 Kings 12:6) 
But up until the twenty-third year of King Joash, the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple.

(2 Kings 12:7) 
So King Joash called Jehoiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: "Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple? Therefore, do not receive any more money according to your assigned duty, but give it for the repair of the temple."

(2 Kings 12:8) 
And the priests were forbidden from receiving any more money from the people or repairing the damages of the temple themselves.

(2 Kings 12:9) 
Then Jehoiada the high priest took a single chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side of those entering the House of the Lord. And the priests who guarded the entrances deposited all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord into it.

(2 Kings 12:10) 
Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go up to it, empty it out, and count the money that was found in the temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:11) 
Then they would give it, carefully counted and measured, into the hands of those who supervised the builders of the House of the Lord. These supervisors, in turn, spent it on the masons and the carpenters who worked on the temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:12) 
They also spent it on those who repaired the cracks, and on purchasing stones and timbers to fully restore the damages of the temple of the Lord, whatever needed repair.

(2 Kings 12:13) 
However, no silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any gold or silver vessels were made from that particular money that was brought into the temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:14) 
Instead, that money was given to those who performed the work, so that they could repair the damages of the temple of the Lord with it.

(2 Kings 12:15) 
And no accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute it to the builders, because they acted with integrity.

(2 Kings 12:16) 
However, money from trespass offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the Lord, but belonged to the priests.

(2 Kings 12:17) 
At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, came up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching up against Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:18) 
For this reason, Joash, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, King Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, had consecrated, along with what he himself had offered. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and in the king's treasuries, and he sent it to Hazael, the king of Syria. As a result, Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:19) 
As for the rest of the deeds of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 12:20) 
But his servants conspired against him and struck him down in the House of Millo, on the road down to Silla.

(2 Kings 12:21) 
Indeed, Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. They buried him with his fathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 12:22)

(2 Kings 12:39) 


(2 Kings 12:40) 


(2 Kings 12:1) 
In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba.

(2 Kings 12:2) 
King Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the High Priest guided and taught him.

(2 Kings 12:3) 
Nevertheless, the king did not remove the high places of worship. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these high places.

(2 Kings 12:4) 
King Joash then spoke to the priests: "All the consecrated funds that are brought into the Temple of the Lord by those who pass through, and the money offered as a redemption for a soul, and whatever people willingly and freely bring into the Temple of the Lord, out of their own free will—"

(2 Kings 12:5) 
"...—the priests are to receive these funds according to their assigned duties, and they must use them to repair the structural damage of the Temple, specifically anything they find that is broken or dilapidated."

(2 Kings 12:6) 
However, up until the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had not yet repaired the structural damage of the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:7) 
So King Joash called for Jehoiada the High Priest and the other priests, asking them: "Why are you not repairing the damage to the Temple? From now on, you are not to personally receive the money, but instead, you must hand it over specifically for the purpose of repairing and restoring the Temple's damage."

(2 Kings 12:8) 
Therefore, the priests were forbidden from then on to collect money directly from the people for themselves, or to manage the repairs of the Temple on their own.

(2 Kings 12:9) 
So Jehoiada the High Priest took one chest, drilled a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the House of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance then put all the money that was brought into the Temple of the Lord into this chest.

(2 Kings 12:10) 
When they saw that a large amount of money had accumulated in the chest, the king's scribe and the High Priest would go up, empty out the chest, and count the money that was found in the House of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:11) 
They would then give the counted money to those who were in charge of the craftsmen, the skilled laborers, and the builders of the House of the Lord. These were the ones responsible for repairing the structural work of the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:12) 
This money was given to the carpenters, the masons, and those who quarried stones. It was also used to purchase wood and cut stones from the quarries for repairing the structural work of the House of the Lord, and for all other materials needed for the Temple's restoration.

(2 Kings 12:13) 
However, from the money that was brought into the Temple, no silver basins, tongs, bowls, trumpets, or any other golden or silver vessels were made for the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:14) 
Instead, the money was given to the workers so that they could use it to repair the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 12:15) 
And no accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute it to the craftsmen and skilled laborers, for they acted with faithfulness and integrity.

(2 Kings 12:16) 
However, money from trespass offerings and money from sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the Lord, because these specific funds belonged to the priests as their rightful portion.

(2 Kings 12:17) 
At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, attacked and fought against Gath, capturing it. He then set his sights on Jerusalem, preparing to conquer it next.

(2 Kings 12:18) 
Because of this threat, King Joash of Judah took all the sacred gifts that his fathers—Kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah of Judah—had dedicated, along with his own offerings. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the House of the Lord and in the king's treasury. He sent all of this to King Hazael of Syria, and by doing so, he diverted the attack away from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:19) 
Now, concerning the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he accomplished, are these not indeed written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 12:20) 
However, his own servants rose up and conspired against him, striking down King Joash at Beth Millo, on the road descending to Silla.

(2 Kings 12:21) 
Indeed, his servants Jozachar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, were the ones who struck him, and he died. They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Amaziah became king in his place.

(2 Kings 12:1) 
In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba.

(2 Kings 12:2) 
Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

(2 Kings 12:3) 
However, he did not remove the high places of pagan worship. The people still continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these high places.

(2 Kings 12:4) 
Joash then said to the priests: 'All the money offered as sacred gifts that is brought into the Temple of the Lord by those passing through, and from individual men, according to the assessed value of their souls, and all the money that is voluntarily and willingly brought into the Temple of the Lord—'

(2 Kings 12:5) 
'—let the priests receive it according to their regular practice, and use it to repair the Temple's damage, wherever ruin is found.'

(2 Kings 12:6) 
However, up to the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had not yet repaired the Temple's damage.

(2 Kings 12:7) 
So King Joash called for Jehoiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: 'Why have you not repaired the Temple's damage? From now on, you are not to receive money according to your regular portion, but you must give it for the restoration of the Temple.'

(2 Kings 12:8) 
Consequently, the priests were forbidden from receiving any more money from the people for their own use, and they were instead charged with repairing the Temple.

(2 Kings 12:9) 
Then Jehoiada the high priest took a single chest, cut a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, to the right of those entering the Lord's house. The priests who guarded the doors would place all the money that was brought into the Lord's Temple into this chest.

(2 Kings 12:10) 
Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of silver in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest would go up, empty it, and count the money that was found in the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 12:11) 
They would then give the counted money to those who were in charge of the work, and to the carpenters and masons who were repairing the Lord's house,

(2 Kings 12:12) 
and to those who cut stones, and to those who carried materials. This was also for buying timber and cut stones, and for performing all other repairs needed for the Lord's Temple.

(2 Kings 12:13) 
However, no golden or silver ornaments, no bowls, no basins, no trumpets, nor any golden or silver vessels were made for the Lord's Temple from the money that was brought in.

(2 Kings 12:14) 
Instead, the money was given to the workmen so that the Lord's Temple could be repaired with it.

(2 Kings 12:15) 
The men who received the money to distribute to the workmen were not required to give an account for it, because they acted with integrity and trustworthiness.

(2 Kings 12:16) 
But the money for guilt offerings and the money for sin offerings was not brought into the Lord's Temple, because that money belonged to the priests as their portion.

(2 Kings 12:17) 
At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, went up and fought against Gath and captured it. He then set his sights on marching against Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:18) 
Because of this threat, Joash, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, King Jehoshaphat, King Jehoram, and King Ahaziah, had consecrated, along with his own offerings, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and in the king's palace. He sent all of this to Hazael, the king of Syria, and Hazael then turned away from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 12:19) 
As for the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 12:20) 
However, his own servants rose up and formed a conspiracy among themselves. They struck down Joash in the house of Millo, which is on the way down to Silla.

(2 Kings 12:21) 
Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his own servants, struck him dead. He was buried with his forefathers in the city of David, and his son Amaziah became king in his place.

In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, who was king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.

(2 Kings 13:2) 
And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, and he did not turn away from those sins.

(2 Kings 13:3) 
So the Lord was angry with Israel and delivered them into the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the power of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, for all those days.

(2 Kings 13:4) 
But Jehoahaz pleaded with the Lord, and the Lord heard him, for He saw the suffering of Israel because the king of Syria had greatly oppressed them.

(2 Kings 13:5) 
And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and he freed them from the power of Syria, so the children of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before—in peace and security.

(2 Kings 13:6) 
Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin, but they persisted in those sins. Moreover, the Asherah pole also remained standing in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:7) 
And the Lord had left to Jehoahaz no more of the people than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like dust when threshing grain.

(2 Kings 13:8) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:9) 
So Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 13:10) 
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, the king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for sixteen years.

(2 Kings 13:11) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, but he persisted in them.

(2 Kings 13:12) 
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, and how he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:13) 
So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

(2 Kings 13:14) 
Now Elisha was suffering from the illness of which he was to die. And Joash, the king of Israel, went down to him and wept before him, saying, 'My father, my father! You are the very strength and defense of Israel!'

(2 Kings 13:15) 
And Elisha said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' So he brought a bow and arrows to him.

(2 Kings 13:16) 
He then said to the king of Israel, 'Put your hand on the bow.' And when the king had put his hand on it, Elisha put his own hands over the king's hands.

(2 Kings 13:17) 
And Elisha said, 'Open the eastern window.' And when he had opened it, Elisha said, 'Shoot the arrow!' And he shot it. Then Elisha said, 'This is the arrow of the Lord’s deliverance, the arrow of deliverance against Syria! You will strike down Syria at Aphek until you have utterly destroyed them!'

(2 Kings 13:18) 
And again Elisha said, 'Take the arrows.' And when he had taken them, he said to the king of Israel, 'Strike the ground with the arrows.' And he struck the ground three times, and then he stopped.

(2 Kings 13:19) 
And the man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck the ground five or six or seven times, you would have struck down Syria until its complete destruction. But now you will strike Syria only three times!'

(2 Kings 13:20) 
So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now, bands of Moabite raiders would invade the land in the spring of that year.

(2 Kings 13:21) 
And as some men were burying a man, they saw the raiders and quickly threw the corpse into Elisha’s tomb. And when the corpse touched the bones of Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet.

(2 Kings 13:22) 
Now Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel throughout all the days of Jehoahaz.

(2 Kings 13:23) 
But the Lord was merciful to them and turned to them because of His covenant which He had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was unwilling to destroy them or utterly cast them from His presence, even to this present time.

(2 Kings 13:24) 
So Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and Ben-Hadad, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 13:25) 
And Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, took back from the power of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which Hazael had taken from the power of Jehoahaz, his father, in battle. Joash defeated him three times and restored the cities to Israel.

(2 Kings 13:1) 
In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began his seventeen-year reign over Israel in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:2) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He continued to commit the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. He did not turn away from those sins.

(2 Kings 13:3) 
The Lord's anger burned hot against Israel. He handed them over to the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and later to Ben-Hadad, Hazael’s son, for the entire reign of these kings.

(2 Kings 13:4) 
Jehoahaz then pleaded before the Lord, and the Lord heard him, for the Lord saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria was crushing them.

(2 Kings 13:5) 
And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and they were rescued from the power of the king of Syria. The Israelites then lived in their homes in peace, as they had in previous times.

(2 Kings 13:6) 
However, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's family line, who caused Israel to sin. Instead, they continued to practice those very sins. Moreover, the Asherah pole—a false idol—remained standing in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:7) 
Jehoahaz had almost no fighting force left from his army, except for fifty cavalrymen, ten chariots, and ten thousand infantrymen. This was because the king of Syria had decimated them, he had ground them down like dust on the threshing floor.

(2 Kings 13:8) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:9) 
Jehoahaz rested in death with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Joash began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 13:10) 
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash's reign over Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, began his sixteen-year reign over Israel in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:11) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, but he continued to practice those very sins.

(2 Kings 13:12) 
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, including how he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:13) 
Joash rested in death with his ancestors, and Jeroboam then took his place on the throne. Moreover, Joash was buried in Samaria, among the kings of Israel.

(2 Kings 13:14) 
Now Elisha was suffering from the illness that would ultimately cause his death. King Joash of Israel went to visit him and wept before him, crying out: "My father, my father! You are the very strength of Israel, its chariots and horsemen!"

(2 Kings 13:15) 
Elisha said to him, "Bring a bow and arrows." And when the king had brought him a bow and arrows,

(2 Kings 13:16) 
Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Place your hand on the bow." And when the king had placed his hand on the bow, Elisha placed his own hands over the king's hands.

(2 Kings 13:17) 
Then Elisha said, "Open the window facing east." And the king opened it. Elisha told him, "Shoot." And he shot the arrow. Elisha declared: "This is the Lord's arrow of salvation, an arrow of victory against Syria! You will strike down Syria at Aphek until they are utterly defeated."

(2 Kings 13:18) 
Then Elisha said, "Now pick up the arrows." And the king picked them up. Again, Elisha told him, "Strike the ground with them." So the king struck the ground three times, and then he stopped.

(2 Kings 13:19) 
And the man of God became angry with him and said, "If you had struck the ground five or six times, you would have completely defeated Syria. But now, you will defeat Syria only three times."

(2 Kings 13:20) 
So Elisha died, and he was buried. Now, every year, Moabite raiding parties would invade the land.

(2 Kings 13:21) 
Once, as some men were burying a dead man, they suddenly saw a raiding party approaching and quickly threw the dead body into Elisha's tomb. As soon as the body touched Elisha's bones, the man was restored to life and stood up on his feet.

(2 Kings 13:22) 
Throughout the entire reign of Jehoahaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.

(2 Kings 13:23) 
But the Lord had compassion on them and He turned back to them because of His covenant, which He had established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was unwilling to destroy them or to utterly cast them away from His presence, right up to the present day.

(2 Kings 13:24) 
Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Ben-Hadad began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 13:25) 
Now Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, recaptured the cities that Ben-Hadad, son of Hazael, had taken from his father, Jehoahaz. Joash defeated Ben-Hadad three times and restored the cities of Israel to its control.

(2 Kings 13:1) 
In the twenty-third year of Joas, son of Ochozia, the king of Judah, Joachaz, son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.

(2 Kings 13:2) 
He did evil in the Lord's presence. He continued the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat, who had led Israel into sin, and he never turned away from them.

(2 Kings 13:3) 
The Lord's wrath burned against Israel, and He handed them over to Hazael, king of Syria, and to Hazael's son, Benadad, for many days.

(2 Kings 13:4) 
However, Joachaz implored the Lord for help, and the Lord heard him, because He had seen the distress of Israel and how the king of Syria had afflicted them.

(2 Kings 13:5) 
So the Lord provided Israel with a deliverer, and He freed them from the hand of the king of Syria. The people of Israel were released from Syrian control and were able to live in their homes peacefully again, just as they had before the war.

(2 Kings 13:6) 
Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's house—the ones who had led Israel into sin. Instead, they continued in them. Even the Asherah pole, dedicated to false gods, remained standing in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:7) 
For Joachaz, there were only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers left in his army. The king of Syria had destroyed all the rest, crushing them like dust under the threshing sledge.

(2 Kings 13:8) 
Now, the rest of the history of Joachaz—all that he did, and how bravely he acted—is it not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:9) 
Joachaz died and was buried in Samaria. Then his son, Joas, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 13:10) 
In the thirty-seventh year of Joas, the king of Judah, Joas, son of Joachaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.

(2 Kings 13:11) 
He also did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat, who had led Israel into sin, but he continued to practice them.

(2 Kings 13:12) 
Now, the rest of the history of Joas—all that he did, and his might in fighting against Amasias, the king of Judah—is it not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:13) 
Joas died, and Jeroboam, his son, sat on his throne. Joas was buried in Samaria, among the kings of Israel.

(2 Kings 13:14) 
Now Eliseus became sick with the illness from which he would die. Joas, the king of Israel, went down to visit him and wept before him, saying, 'My father, my father! You are like the chariot and horsemen of Israel!'

(2 Kings 13:15) 
Eliseus said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' So the king brought him a bow and arrows.

(2 Kings 13:16) 
Then Eliseus said to the king of Israel, 'Put your hand on the bow.' The king did so, and Eliseus placed his own hands over the king's hands.

(2 Kings 13:17) 
Eliseus said, 'Open the window to the east.' When the king opened it, Eliseus commanded, 'Shoot the arrow!' The king shot the arrow. Then Eliseus declared, 'This is the Lord's arrow of salvation and deliverance against Syria! You will strike Syria at Aphec until you completely destroy them!'

(2 Kings 13:18) 
Then Eliseus said, 'Take the arrows.' When the king had taken them, Eliseus said to him again, 'Strike the ground!' The king struck the ground three times and then stopped.

(2 Kings 13:19) 
The man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck five, six, or even seven times, you would have utterly destroyed Syria! But now, you will strike Syria only three times.'

(2 Kings 13:20) 
So Eliseus died, and they buried him. In that same year, Moabite raiding parties invaded the land.

(2 Kings 13:21) 
As some men were burying a dead body, they suddenly saw the Moabite raiding parties approaching. So, they quickly threw the corpse into Eliseus's tomb. When the body touched Eliseus's bones, the man came back to life and stood on his feet!

(2 Kings 13:22) 
Throughout the entire reign of Joachaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.

(2 Kings 13:23) 
However, the Lord had compassion on them. He turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not wish to destroy them or utterly cast them out from His presence, even to this very day.

(2 Kings 13:24) 
Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Benadad reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 13:25) 
Furthermore, Joas, son of Joachaz, recaptured the cities from Benadad, son of Hazael—the very cities Benadad's father had seized from Joachaz, his own father, in battle. Joas defeated Benadad three times, thus restoring those cities to Israel.

(2 Kings 13:1) 
In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began his reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for seventeen years.

(2 Kings 13:2) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had made Israel commit sin; Jehoahaz did not turn away from those sins.

(2 Kings 13:3) 
Therefore, the Lord was angry with Israel. He handed them over to the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the power of Ben-Hadad, Hazael's son, throughout those days.

(2 Kings 13:4) 
But Jehoahaz pleaded before the Lord. And the Lord heard him, because He saw the distress of Israel; for the king of Syria had oppressed them.

(2 Kings 13:5) 
So the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and they were freed from the power of the king of Syria. Then the children of Israel were able to live in their homes, as they had in times past.

(2 Kings 13:6) 
Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel commit sin; instead, they continued in them. Indeed, the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.

(2 Kings 13:7) 
For Jehoahaz, there remained no more of the army than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. This was because the king of Syria had destroyed everyone else, crushing them like dust under the threshing sledges.

(2 Kings 13:8) 
Now, as for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and everything he did, and his valiant deeds—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:9) 
So Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Jehoash became king in his place.

(2 Kings 13:10) 
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for sixteen years.

(2 Kings 13:11) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had made Israel commit sin, but walked in them.

(2 Kings 13:12) 
Now, as for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, and everything he did, and his might in how he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 13:13) 
So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

(2 Kings 13:14) 
Now Elisha became sick with the illness by which he eventually died. Then Jehoash, the king of Israel, went down to him and wept over him, saying: 'My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!'

(2 Kings 13:15) 
Elisha then said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' When Jehoash had brought him a bow and arrows,

(2 Kings 13:16) 
Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'Place your hand upon the bow.' And Jehoash placed his hand upon it, and Elisha placed his hands over the king's hands.

(2 Kings 13:17) 
And Elisha said, 'Open the window toward the east.' When Jehoash had opened it, Elisha said, 'Shoot the arrow!' And he shot it. Then Elisha declared, 'This is the arrow of the Lord's deliverance! It is the arrow of deliverance against Syria! For you will strike Syria in Aphek until you completely destroy them.'

(2 Kings 13:18) 
And Elisha said, 'Take the arrows.' When Jehoash had taken them, Elisha again said to him, 'Strike the ground.' And he struck it three times, and then he stopped.

(2 Kings 13:19) 
Then the man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck five or six times, you would have struck Syria until their complete destruction. But now, you will strike Syria only three times.'

(2 Kings 13:20) 
So Elisha died, and they buried him. And raiding parties from Moab invaded the land in that very year.

(2 Kings 13:21) 
Now it happened that some men were burying a dead person when they saw the raiding parties. So they threw the corpse into Elisha's tomb. When the dead man touched Elisha's bones, he revived and stood up on his feet.

(2 Kings 13:22) 
Indeed, throughout all the days of King Jehoahaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.

(2 Kings 13:23) 
But the Lord had mercy on them and turned back to them because of His covenant which He had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not wish to destroy them, nor to cast them utterly away from His sight, even until the present day.

(2 Kings 13:24) 
Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Ben-Hadad reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 13:25) 
Moreover, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, then recovered the cities from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael. These were the cities that Ben-Hadad had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz, Jehoash's father, by right of war, throughout all those days. Jehoash struck him three times, and so restored the cities to Israel.

(2 Kings 14:1) 
In the second year of Joas, the son of Joachaz and King of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 14:2) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Joadan, who was from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:3) 
Amasias did what was right in the sight of the Lord, however, he did not do it with the same wholeheartedness as David, his father. He followed all the ways that Joas, his father, had done before him.

(2 Kings 14:4) 
Yet the high places of idolatry were not removed; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods.

(2 Kings 14:5) 
After he had established his royal authority and secured the kingdom in his own hands, Amasias struck down his servants who had assassinated Joas, his royal father.

(2 Kings 14:6) 
But the sons of those assassins he did not put to death. He acted according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the Lord commanded, saying: 'Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; rather, each person shall die for their own sin alone.'

(2 Kings 14:7) 
Amasias himself struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, killing ten thousand men. He captured the city of Sela in battle, and he called its name Jecthel, which remains its name to this very day.

(2 Kings 14:8) 
Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz and grandson of Jehu, who was King of Israel. Amasias' message was: 'Come, let us look each other in the face,' meaning, 'Let us meet in battle.'

(2 Kings 14:9) 
Joas, the King of Israel, sent this reply to Amasias, the King of Judah: 'The thistle in the field sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, "Give your daughter to my son to be his wife." But a wild beast passed by and trampled the thistle underfoot.'

(2 Kings 14:10) 
Joas continued, 'You have indeed struck down and conquered Edom, and your heart has been lifted up in pride because of it. Rejoice in your victory, but stay in your own house and enjoy your triumph. Why do you provoke evil, so that you fall, and Judah with you?'

(2 Kings 14:11) 
But Amasias did not listen to this warning. So Joas, the King of Israel, went up with his army. And he, along with Amasias, the King of Judah, met each other in battle at Beth Shemesh, a town in Judah.

(2 Kings 14:12) 
Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man of Judah fled back to his own tent, abandoning the battle.

(2 Kings 14:13) 
Joas, the King of Israel, captured Amasias, the King of Judah — the son of Joas, and grandson of Ochozias — at Beth Shemesh. Joas then brought Amasias as his prisoner to Jerusalem. There, Joas broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits — a significant humiliation and weakening of Judah's defenses.

(2 Kings 14:14) 
Joas took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels he found in the house of the Lord and in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, and then he returned to Samaria, the capital of Israel.

(2 Kings 14:15) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Joas, and his military strength, and how he fought against Amasias, the King of Judah — are these not all written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:16) 
Joas then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — and was buried in Samaria with the other Kings of Israel. And his son, Jeroboam, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:17) 
Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, lived for fifteen years after Joas, the son of Joachaz and King of Israel, had died.

(2 Kings 14:18) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Amasias — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:19) 
A conspiracy was made against Amasias in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish to escape, but he was killed there.

(2 Kings 14:20) 
His body was then brought back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.

(2 Kings 14:21) 
Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and they appointed him king in place of his father Amasias.

(2 Kings 14:22) 
It was Azarias who rebuilt Ailath and restored it to Judah, after the king — his father — had died.

(2 Kings 14:23) 
In the fifteenth year of Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas and King of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.

(2 Kings 14:24) 
Jeroboam did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin and worship idols.

(2 Kings 14:25) 
It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel. This word was spoken through His servant Jonas, the son of Amathi, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.

(2 Kings 14:26) 
For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was exceedingly bitter. He saw that they were utterly consumed and trapped, even those who remained, and there was no helper left for Israel.

(2 Kings 14:27) 
The Lord had not yet declared that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky — meaning from existence. Instead, He saved them through the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.

(2 Kings 14:28) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and everything he did, including his military strength, and how he fought, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath for Judah within Israel — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:29) 
Jeroboam then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — with the other Kings of Israel. And his son, Zacharias, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:30) 
In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, the King of Israel, Azarias, the son of Amasias and King of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 14:31) 
He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jechelia, who was from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:32) 
Azarias did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, following all the ways that his father Amasias had done.

(2 Kings 14:33) 
Yet, he did not remove the high places of idolatry; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods.

(2 Kings 14:34) 
But the Lord struck the king, and he became a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, isolated because of his illness. Joatham, the king's son, managed the palace and governed the people of the land in his father's stead.

(2 Kings 14:35) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Azarias, and everything he did — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:36) 
Azarias then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And his son, Joatham, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:37) 
In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah and King of Israel, Joatham, the son of Ozias and King of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 14:38) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusa, the daughter of Sadoc.

(2 Kings 14:39) 
Joatham did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, following all the ways that his father Ozias had done.

(2 Kings 14:40) 
Yet, he did not remove the high places of idolatry; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods. However, he himself built the upper gate of the house of the Lord.

(2 Kings 14:1) 
In the second year of the reign of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, who was king of Israel, Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 14:2) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:3) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord God. However, he did not do so perfectly, like his ancestor David. Instead, he did everything just as Joash, his father, had done.

(2 Kings 14:4) 
Nevertheless, Amaziah did not remove the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense in these high places.

(2 Kings 14:5) 
After he had secured his royal power, he executed his own servants who had assassinated King Joash, his father.

(2 Kings 14:6) 
But he did not put their children to death. He acted according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the Lord God had commanded, saying: "Fathers shall not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor shall children be put to death for the sins of their fathers. Rather, each person shall die for their own sin."

(2 Kings 14:7) 
It was Amaziah himself who struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He also captured the city of Sela in battle, and he named it Joktheel, a name it bears even to this present day.

(2 Kings 14:8) 
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us confront each other in battle."

(2 Kings 14:9) 
King Joash of Israel sent back a message to King Amaziah of Judah, saying: "The insignificant thistle of Lebanon sent a message to the mighty cedar of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter as a wife to my son.' But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled the thistle. This is a warning that you are beneath me."

(2 Kings 14:10) 
You have indeed struck down Edom and gained a victory, and your heart has become proud because of it. Be content with this glory, and stay in your own house. Why provoke such a disaster, that you should fall, and Judah with you?

(2 Kings 14:11) 
But Amaziah would not listen to this warning. So King Joash of Israel went up against him. Both he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other at Beth Shemesh, a city in Judah.

(2 Kings 14:12) 
And Judah was defeated before Israel. Every man then fled to his own tent, abandoning the battle.

(2 Kings 14:13) 
King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Joash then brought Amaziah back to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.

(2 Kings 14:14) 
He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the Temple of the Lord God, as well as in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, and then returned to Samaria, the capital of his kingdom.

(2 Kings 14:15) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Joash, and his military might, and how he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:16) 
So Joash passed away and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam, his son, began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 14:17) 
Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 14:18) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Amaziah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:19) 
After a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, Amaziah fled to Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.

(2 Kings 14:20) 
They brought his body back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.

(2 Kings 14:21) 
Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. (He is also known as Uzziah.)

(2 Kings 14:22) 
It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah, after King Amaziah passed away and was buried with his ancestors.

(2 Kings 14:23) 
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, who was king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began his reign in Samaria. He reigned for forty-one years.

(2 Kings 14:24) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin by establishing idol worship.

(2 Kings 14:25) 
It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (which is the Dead Sea). He did this according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah, the prophet, the son of Amittai, who was from Gath Hepher.

(2 Kings 14:26) 
For the Lord God saw the very bitter affliction of Israel. There was no one left, whether enslaved or free, and no one to help Israel.

(2 Kings 14:27) 
And the Lord God had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven. So He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.

(2 Kings 14:28) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his military might, and how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah within Israel—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:29) 
So Jeroboam passed away and was buried with the kings of Israel. And Zechariah, his son, began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 14:30) 
In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Azariah, the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 14:31) 
He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:32) 
And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord God, just as his father Amaziah had done in every way.

(2 Kings 14:33) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship. The people still continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.

(2 Kings 14:34) 
But the Lord God struck the king, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. Because of his leprosy, he had to live in a separate house, isolated from the people. And Jotham, the king's son, was in charge of the royal household and governed the people of the land.

(2 Kings 14:35) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:36) 
So Azariah passed away and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Jotham, his son, began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 14:37) 
In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months.

(2 Kings 14:38) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.

(2 Kings 14:39) 
And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. Shallum struck him down in public, killed him, and then began to reign in his place.

(2 Kings 14:40) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Zechariah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:1) 
In the second year of Joas, who was the son of Joachaz and king of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas, began his reign as king over Judah.

(2 Kings 14:2) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:3) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David, his great ancestor. He did everything just as his father Joas had done.

(2 Kings 14:4) 
However, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.

(2 Kings 14:5) 
When he had taken firm control of his kingdom, he executed the servants who had murdered Joas, his royal father.

(2 Kings 14:6) 
But he did not put the children of those murderers to death, according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses—for the Lord had commanded this, saying: "Fathers shall not die for their children, nor shall children die for their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin."

(2 Kings 14:7) 
He himself struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand men; and he captured the city of Sela in battle, and he called its name Jectehel, which it is still called to this very day.

(2 Kings 14:8) 
Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz and grandson of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us look each other in the face"—meaning, "Let us fight in battle."

(2 Kings 14:9) 
Joas, the king of Israel, sent back a reply to Amasias, king of Judah, saying: "The thistles of the field sent word to the cedars of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled down the thistles."

(2 Kings 14:10) 
"You have indeed struck down Edom and you have grown arrogant because of it. Be content with your victory and remain in your own house. Why provoke such evil against yourself, that both you and Judah should fall with you?"

(2 Kings 14:11) 
But Amasias would not listen to the warning. So Joas, the king of Israel, went up against him, and Amasias, the king of Judah, also went forth; and they faced each other in Bethsames, a town in Judah.

(2 Kings 14:12) 
Judah was defeated by Israel in the battle, and every man of Judah fled back to his own tent.

(2 Kings 14:13) 
Joas, the king of Israel, captured Amasias, the king of Judah (who was the son of Joas, and grandson of Ochozias), at Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem. Then Joas tore down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a length of four hundred cubits—which is about 600 feet.

(2 Kings 14:14) 
He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that he found in the house of the Lord and in the king's treasuries, and he brought the hostages back with him to Samaria.

(2 Kings 14:15) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Joas, and his strength, and how he fought against Amasias, the king of Judah—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:16) 
So Joas slept with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:17) 
Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 14:18) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Amasias—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:19) 
And a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachis. But they sent men after him to Lachis, and they put him to death there.

(2 Kings 14:20) 
And they brought his body back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.

(2 Kings 14:21) 
Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and they made him king in place of his father Amasias.

(2 Kings 14:22) 
It was he who built Ailath and restored it to Judah, after the king—his father—had slept with his fathers.

(2 Kings 14:23) 
In the fifteenth year of Amasias, the son of Joas and king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas, began to reign as king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.

(2 Kings 14:24) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had made Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 14:25) 
It was he who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Emath as far as the Sea of the Desert, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonas, the son of Amathi, the prophet, who was from Geth-opher.

(2 Kings 14:26) 
For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was exceedingly bitter, and that they were utterly consumed and shut in, and there was no helper for Israel.

(2 Kings 14:27) 
And the Lord had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; rather, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.

(2 Kings 14:28) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his strength, how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Emath to Judah in Israel—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:29) 
So Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zacharias, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:1) 
In the second year that Joas, the son of Joachaz, was king of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas, began his reign as king of Judah.

(2 Kings 14:2) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 14:3) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord; however, not in the same manner as his ancestor David. Amasias did everything that was to be done according to the ways of Joas his father.

(2 Kings 14:4) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.

(2 Kings 14:5) 
As soon as he had firmly established his kingship, he executed the servants who had murdered his father, the king.

(2 Kings 14:6) 
However, he did not put to death the children of the murderers. He acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, for the Lord had commanded, saying: 'Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; rather, each person shall die for their own sin.'

(2 Kings 14:7) 
Amasias himself struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and he captured Petra—the city then called Sela—in battle. He then renamed it Jectheel, which it is still called to this very day.

(2 Kings 14:8) 
Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: 'Come, let us meet face-to-face in battle!'

(2 Kings 14:9) 
Joas, king of Israel, sent back this reply to Amasias, king of Judah: 'A lowly lily of the field once sent a message to the mighty cedar of Lebanon, saying: "Give your daughter to my son as a wife." But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled the lily underfoot.'

(2 Kings 14:10) 
You have struck down Edom, and your heart has become arrogant because of it. Be content with your glory, and remain in your own palace! Why do you provoke this evil that will cause both you and Judah to fall with you?'

(2 Kings 14:11) 
But Amasias would not yield. So Joas, king of Israel, went up with his forces, and he and Amasias, king of Judah, met face-to-face in Beth-shemesh of Judah for battle.

(2 Kings 14:12) 
Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled home to his own dwelling.

(2 Kings 14:13) 
Joas, king of Israel, captured Amasias, king of Judah—the son of Joas and grandson of Ochozias—in Beth-shemesh. He then brought Amasias to Jerusalem and demolished a section of Jerusalem's city wall, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.

(2 Kings 14:14) 
Joas took all the gold and silver, along with all the vessels he found in the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasuries. He also took hostages, and then he returned with all of it to Samaria.

(2 Kings 14:15) 
As for the rest of the deeds of Joas, and all his might, and how he fought against Amasias, king of Judah—are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:16) 
Joas died and was buried in Samaria alongside the other kings of Israel. His son, Jeroboam, then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 14:17) 
Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.

(2 Kings 14:18) 
As for the rest of the deeds of Amasias, are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 14:19) 
When a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, Amasias fled to Lachish. But his enemies sent men after him to Lachish and murdered him there.

(2 Kings 14:20) 
His body was brought back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David.

(2 Kings 14:21) 
Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amasias.

(2 Kings 14:22) 
It was Azarias who rebuilt Ailath and restored it to Judah, after his father, the king, had died.

(2 Kings 14:23) 
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas, began his reign as king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.

(2 Kings 14:24) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 14:25) 
It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath all the way to the Sea of the Arabah—the Dead Sea—just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had declared. This was spoken through His servant Jonas, the prophet, the son of Amathi, who was from Gath-hepher.

(2 Kings 14:26) 
For the Lord had seen how very bitter was the affliction of Israel. They were utterly consumed, and there was no one left to help, neither bond nor free; no one to come to Israel's aid.

(2 Kings 14:27) 
The Lord had not yet declared that He would blot out the name of Israel from the face of the earth. So, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.

(2 Kings 14:28) 
As for the rest of the deeds of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might—how he fought his battles, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath, previously held by Judah, back to Israel—are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 14:29) 
Jeroboam died and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then his son Zacharias reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:1) 
In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam's reign in Israel, Azariah, the son of King Amaziah of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 15:2) 
He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jechelia, who was from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 15:3) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done in all things.

(2 Kings 15:4) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense on these high places.

(2 Kings 15:5) 
Therefore, the Lord struck the king with leprosy, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a private house, set apart from others. Jotham, the king's son, managed the royal household and governed the people of the land.

(2 Kings 15:6) 
All the other deeds of Azariah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 15:7) 
Azariah died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jotham then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:8) 
In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months.

(2 Kings 15:9) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestors had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.

(2 Kings 15:10) 
Shallum, son of Jabesh, conspired against him. He struck Zechariah down in public, killing him, and then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:11) 
All the other deeds of Zechariah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:12) 
This fulfilled the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Jehu, saying, "Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel for four generations." And so it came to pass.

(2 Kings 15:13) 
Shallum, son of Jabesh, began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah, king of Judah. He reigned for only one month in Samaria.

(2 Kings 15:14) 
Then Menahem, son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah to Samaria. He struck down Shallum, son of Jabesh, in Samaria and killed him, then he reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:15) 
All the other deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy he carried out, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:16) 
At that time, Menahem struck down Tappuah and everyone in it, and all its territory, starting from Tirzah, because they had not opened their gates to him. He killed all the pregnant women there and ripped them open.

(2 Kings 15:17) 
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Menahem, son of Gadi, began his ten-year reign over Israel in Samaria.

(2 Kings 15:18) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He never departed from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin, throughout all his days.

(2 Kings 15:19) 
Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came to the land. Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that Pul would help him and strengthen his reign.

(2 Kings 15:20) 
Menahem exacted the money from the people of Israel, from all the powerful and wealthy men, demanding fifty shekels of silver from each, to give to the king of the Assyrians. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not remain in the land.

(2 Kings 15:21) 
All the other deeds of Menahem, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:22) 
Menahem died and was buried with his ancestors. His son Pekahiah then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:23) 
In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekahiah, son of Menahem, reigned over Israel in Samaria for two years.

(2 Kings 15:24) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.

(2 Kings 15:25) 
However, Pekah, son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him. He had fifty men from the sons of the Gileadites with him. He struck Pekahiah down in Samaria, in the citadel of the royal palace, near Argob and Arieh. He killed him and then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:26) 
All the other deeds of Pekahiah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:27) 
In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekah, son of Remaliah, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty years.

(2 Kings 15:28) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.

(2 Kings 15:29) 
In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser, king of the Assyrians, came and captured Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali. He deported the inhabitants of these places to Assyria.

(2 Kings 15:30) 
Then Hoshea, son of Elah, conspired against Pekah, son of Remaliah, striking him down and killing him. He then reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, son of Uzziah.

(2 Kings 15:31) 
All the other deeds of Pekah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:32) 
In the second year of Pekah's reign, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 15:33) 
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.

(2 Kings 15:34) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done in all things.

(2 Kings 15:35) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense on these high places. He himself built the upper gate of the house of the Lord.

(2 Kings 15:36) 
All the other deeds of Jotham, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 15:37) 
In those days, the Lord began to send Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, against Judah.

(2 Kings 15:38) 
Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, his father's city. His son Ahaz then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:1) 
In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Azariah, the son of King Amaziah of Judah, began to reign as king of Judah. —This Jeroboam was Jeroboam II, the son of Joash.

(2 Kings 15:2) 
He was fifteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jechelia, from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 15:3) 
And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done in all things.

(2 Kings 15:4) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places; for the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. —These 'high places' were unauthorized sites of worship outside of the Temple in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 15:5) 
But the Lord struck the king with leprosy, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, while Jotham, the king's son, governed the royal household and judged the people of the land.

(2 Kings 15:6) 
Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 15:7) 
So Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. His son Jotham then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:8) 
In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam (Jeroboam II), began to reign over Israel for six months.

(2 Kings 15:9) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his royal ancestors had done. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had led Israel into idolatry and false worship. —The 'sins of Jeroboam' refer to the worship of golden calves at Dan and Bethel.

(2 Kings 15:10) 
But Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. He struck him down openly, killing him, and then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:11) 
Now the rest of the acts of Zachariah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:12) 
This fulfilled the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Jehu, saying: 'Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel until the fourth generation.' And so it came to pass. —This prophecy was fulfilled with Zachariah, the fourth descendant of Jehu.

(2 Kings 15:13) 
Shallum, the son of Jabesh, began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of King Azariah of Judah. He reigned for only one month in Samaria.

(2 Kings 15:14) 
Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah to Samaria. He struck down Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria, killed him, and then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:15) 
Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy by which he conspired, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:16) 
Then Menahem struck down Tiphsah, and all who were in it, and its territories from Tirzah, because they had not opened their gates to him. He killed all the pregnant women, ripping them open.

(2 Kings 15:17) 
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria.

(2 Kings 15:18) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, throughout all his days.

(2 Kings 15:19) 
Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came into the land of Israel. Menahem, in an act of submission, gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that Pul would offer him military aid and strengthen his hold on the kingdom. —Pul is also known as Tiglath-Pileser III, a powerful Assyrian king.

(2 Kings 15:20) 
Menahem then commanded all the wealthy men of Israel to give money to Pul, each man contributing five hundred shekels of silver, to secure the help of the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned to his own land and did not remain in Israel.

(2 Kings 15:21) 
Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:22) 
So Menahem slept with his fathers. His son Pekahiah then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 15:23) 
In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years.

(2 Kings 15:24) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 15:25) 
But Pekah, the son of Remaliah, his own captain, conspired against him. Pekah struck him down in Samaria, in the citadel of the royal palace, in the presence of Argob and Arie, along with fifty men from the Gileadites. Pekah killed him and then reigned in his place. —The 'citadel of the royal palace' refers to a fortified inner part of the king's residence.

(2 Kings 15:26) 
Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:27) 
In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years.

(2 Kings 15:28) 
And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.

(2 Kings 15:29) 
In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came and captured Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali. He then deported their inhabitants to Assyria. —This Tiglath-Pileser is the same King Pul mentioned earlier, and this deportation was a common Assyrian tactic to suppress rebellion.

(2 Kings 15:30) 
Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, conspired against Pekah, the son of Remaliah. He struck him down and killed him, and then reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Azariah.

(2 Kings 15:31) 
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

(2 Kings 15:32) 
In the second year of Pekah's reign over Israel (Pekah, the son of Remaliah), Jotham, the son of King Azariah of Judah, began to reign as king of Judah.

(2 Kings 15:33) 
He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

(2 Kings 15:34) 
And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Azariah had done in all things.

(2 Kings 15:35) 
Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places; for the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. It was he who built the Upper Gate of the House of the Lord. —The 'high places' were unauthorized sites of worship outside of the Temple in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 15:36) 
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 15:37) 
In those days, the Lord began to send against Judah King Rezin of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah. —Pekah was the reigning king of Israel at this time.

(2 Kings 15:38) 
So Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David, his father. His son Ahaz then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 16:1) 
In the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah, son of Remaliah, Ahaz, son of Jotham, who was the King of Judah, began his reign.

(2 Kings 16:2) 
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike his father David.

(2 Kings 16:3) 
Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Furthermore, he even made his son pass through fire, following the abominable customs of the nations whom the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.

(2 Kings 16:4) 
He also sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree, engaging in idolatry.

(2 Kings 16:5) 
Then Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war. Although they besieged Ahaz, they could not capture him.

(2 Kings 16:6) 
At that time, Rezin, the king of Syria, restored Elath to Syria, driving the Judeans out of Elath. And the Edomites came into Elath and settled there, where they remain even to this very day.

(2 Kings 16:7) 
Then Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser, the king of the Assyrians, saying: "I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me."

(2 Kings 16:8) 
Ahaz then took the silver and gold that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries, and he sent these as gifts to the king of the Assyrians.

(2 Kings 16:9) 
The Assyrian king agreed to his request, for the king of the Assyrians went up to Damascus, devastated it, and deported its inhabitants to Cyrene. He also killed Rezin.

(2 Kings 16:10) 
And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser, the king of the Assyrians. When King Ahaz saw the altar in Damascus, he sent its detailed plan and the exact likeness of all its workmanship to Urijah, the priest.

(2 Kings 16:11) 
And Urijah, the priest, built an altar exactly according to all the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Urijah the priest did this, completing it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.

(2 Kings 16:12) 
When the king returned from Damascus, he saw the altar, and he began to offer sacrifices and vows upon it.

(2 Kings 16:13) 
He burned his burnt offering and his sacrifice, poured out his libations, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar.

(2 Kings 16:14) 
Furthermore, the bronze altar that stood before the Lord, he moved it away from the front of the Temple, from its place between the altar and the Lord's Temple, and placed it on the side of this new, foreign altar.

(2 Kings 16:15) 
King Ahaz also commanded Urijah the priest, saying: "Upon the larger, new altar, offer the morning burnt offering, the evening sacrifice, the king's burnt offering, and his sacrifice, along with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their sacrifices, and their libations. You shall pour all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the sacrifices upon it. As for the bronze altar, it shall be available for my personal discretion and use."

(2 Kings 16:16) 
So Urijah, the priest, did according to all that King Ahaz had commanded.

(2 Kings 16:17) 
King Ahaz also cut off the panels of the stands and removed the basins from them. He also took the great bronze Sea off the twelve oxen-shaped bases that were beneath it, removing it from its stands, and placed it upon a stone pavement.

(2 Kings 16:18) 
The covered passageway for the Sabbath, which he had built in the Temple, and the outer entrance for the king, he removed these from the Temple of the Lord, doing so out of deference to the king of the Assyrians.

(2 Kings 16:19) 
Now, the rest of the deeds of Ahaz, all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 16:20) 
Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 16:1) 
In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King Ahaz, the son of Jotham, began to reign over Judah.

(2 Kings 16:2) 
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king. He reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike his father David, who served God faithfully.

(2 Kings 16:3) 
Instead, he followed the ways of the kings of Israel (who were unfaithful to God). He even sacrificed his own son by fire, according to the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had previously driven out from before the Israelites.

(2 Kings 16:4) 
He also offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places (illicit altars), on the hills, and under every flourishing tree, worshipping pagan deities in these places.

(2 Kings 16:5) 
At that time, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched up to Jerusalem to wage war. Although they besieged Ahaz, they were not able to overcome him.

(2 Kings 16:6) 
At that same time, King Rezin of Syria restored Elath (also known as Eilat or Ailath) to Syria, driving the Jews out of Elath. The Edomites then came into Elath and settled there, where they remained even until the present day.

(2 Kings 16:7) 
King Ahaz then sent messengers to King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, declaring: "I am your servant and your son (meaning, I pledge loyalty and vassalage to you). Come up and rescue me from the power of the King of Syria and from the power of the King of Israel, who have risen up against me."

(2 Kings 16:8) 
Ahaz then took all the silver and gold that could be found in the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasuries, and he sent these valuables as tribute (or gifts) to the King of Assyria.

(2 Kings 16:9) 
The King of Assyria agreed to Ahaz's request. He marched up to Damascus, conquered and devastated it, and deported its inhabitants to Kir (or Cyrene). He also put King Rezin to death.

(2 Kings 16:10) 
King Ahaz then traveled to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria. While there, Ahaz saw the altar in Damascus (which was likely a pagan, Assyrian-style altar). King Ahaz then sent a detailed sketch of this altar, including its full design and every aspect of its construction, to Uriah the priest in Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 16:11) 
So Uriah the priest diligently built an altar exactly according to all the specifications and instructions that King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus. Uriah the priest completed this task before King Ahaz even returned from Damascus.

(2 Kings 16:12) 
When the king returned from Damascus, he saw the new altar. He approached it and venerated it (showing reverence to this foreign, pagan-inspired structure). He then went up to it and offered sacrifices upon it.

(2 Kings 16:13) 
He burned his burnt offerings and his other sacrifices on it, and poured out his drink offerings. He also sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon this altar.

(2 Kings 16:14) 
Furthermore, Ahaz removed the bronze altar that stood before the Lord (the sacred altar originally built by Solomon), which was in front of the Temple, specifically between the new altar and the Temple of the Lord. He moved it from its proper place in front of the Lord’s Temple and positioned it to the side of the new altar.

(2 Kings 16:15) 
King Ahaz then commanded Uriah the priest, saying: "On this larger, new altar (the one copied from Damascus), you are to offer the morning burnt offering and the evening sacrifice. Also offer the king's burnt offering and his sacrifice, along with the burnt offerings of all the people of the land, their sacrifices, and their drink offerings. All the blood from the burnt offerings and all the blood from the sacrifices you shall pour out upon it. The bronze altar (the old, sacred one) will now be reserved for my personal consultation and discretion."

(2 Kings 16:16) 
So Uriah the priest carried out all these instructions, exactly as King Ahaz had commanded him.

(2 Kings 16:17) 
King Ahaz also removed the bronze stands and the basins that rested upon them. He took down the "Sea" (the large bronze basin for ritual washing) from the bronze oxen that supported it, and he placed the "Sea" upon a paved stone platform instead.

(2 Kings 16:18) 
He also removed the covered way for the Sabbath (or "Sabbath structure") that had been built in the Temple. Furthermore, he rerouted the king's outer entrance to the Temple of the Lord, making these changes specifically to appease the King of Assyria and avoid any offense or suspicion.

(2 Kings 16:19) 
Now, the rest of the acts of Ahaz, all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 16:20) 
Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His son Hezekiah then reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 17:1) 
In the twelfth year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea, son of Elah, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for nine years.

(2 Kings 17:2) 
But he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, though not as evil as the kings of Israel who had reigned before him.

(2 Kings 17:3) 
Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, marched against King Hoshea, and Hoshea became his servant and paid tribute to him.

(2 Kings 17:4) 
But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was conspiring against him. Hoshea had sent messengers to the king of Egypt and had stopped paying his yearly tribute to Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea, chained him, and imprisoned him.

(2 Kings 17:5) 
Then the king of Assyria invaded all of the land of Israel. He marched to Samaria and besieged it for three years.

(2 Kings 17:6) 
In the ninth year of Hoshea’s reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried the people of Israel into exile to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, and on the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

(2 Kings 17:7) 
This disaster happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt and freed them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Yet they worshipped other gods.

(2 Kings 17:8) 
They followed the practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before them. They also imitated the practices of the kings of Israel, which were just as evil.

(2 Kings 17:9) 
The people of Israel secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. They built high places for idol worship in all their cities, from watchtowers to fortified cities.

(2 Kings 17:10) 
They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles—idolatrous symbols—on every high hill and under every green tree.

(2 Kings 17:11) 
On all these high places, they burned incense, just like the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before them. They did wicked things that provoked the Lord’s anger.

(2 Kings 17:12) 
They worshipped idols, even though the Lord had told them, “You must not do such a thing.”

(2 Kings 17:13) 
The Lord had warned both Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers, saying, “Turn from your evil ways. Keep My commandments and My ceremonies according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers and that I sent to you through My servants, the prophets.”

(2 Kings 17:14) 
But they would not listen. They became stubborn, just like their fathers, who had refused to obey the Lord their God.

(2 Kings 17:15) 
They rejected His decrees and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the warnings He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the pagan nations around them, even though the Lord had commanded them not to do as those nations did.

(2 Kings 17:16) 
They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They made for themselves two calves of cast metal, and Asherah poles. They worshipped all the host of the universe—the stars and planets—and they served Baal.

(2 Kings 17:17) 
They sacrificed their sons and daughters in fire as offerings to idols. They practiced divination and omens, and they surrendered themselves to doing evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking His anger.

(2 Kings 17:18) 
So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah was left.

(2 Kings 17:19) 
Even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God; instead, they followed the sinful practices that Israel had introduced.

(2 Kings 17:20) 
Therefore, the Lord rejected all the people of Israel. He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence.

(2 Kings 17:21) 
For Israel had been torn away from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam, son of Nebat, their king. Jeroboam then led Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.

(2 Kings 17:22) 
The people of Israel continued in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and they did not turn away from them.

(2 Kings 17:23) 
So the Lord removed Israel from His presence, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, where they remain to this very day.

(2 Kings 17:24) 
Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the people of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.

(2 Kings 17:25) 
When these new inhabitants first began to live there, they did not worship the Lord, so the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.

(2 Kings 17:26) 
So the king of Assyria was informed, “The nations whom you have deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of that land. Therefore, the Lord has sent lions among them, and they are killing them because they do not know the proper way to worship the God of that land.”

(2 Kings 17:27) 
Then the king of Assyria gave this command: “Send back one of the priests whom you captured from there. Let him go and live among them and teach them the customs of the God of that land.”

(2 Kings 17:28) 
So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and he taught them how they should worship the Lord.

(2 Kings 17:29) 
Nevertheless, each of these foreign nations made their own gods and placed them in the shrines on the high places that the Samaritans had built. Each nation did this in the cities where they lived.

(2 Kings 17:30) 
The people from Babylon made Succoth-Benoth; the people from Cuthah made Nergal; and the people from Hamath made Ashima.

(2 Kings 17:31) 
The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in fire as offerings to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

(2 Kings 17:32) 
They did worship the Lord, but they also appointed priests from among themselves for the high places, and these priests offered sacrifices in the shrines of the high places.

(2 Kings 17:33) 
So they worshipped the Lord, but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.

(2 Kings 17:34) 
Even to this present day, they continue to practice their former customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they observe His ceremonies, His judgments, His Law, or the commandment that the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom He gave the name Israel.

(2 Kings 17:35) 
When the Lord had made a covenant with them, He commanded them, saying, “You must not fear other gods, nor worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.

(2 Kings 17:36) 
But you must fear the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Him alone you must fear, Him alone you must worship, and to Him alone you must sacrifice.

(2 Kings 17:37) 
You must always be careful to observe the ceremonies, the judgments, the Law, and the commandments that He wrote for you. You must not fear other gods.

(2 Kings 17:38) 
And the covenant that I made with you, you must not forget. You must not worship other gods.

(2 Kings 17:39) 
Instead, fear the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the power of all your enemies.”

(2 Kings 17:40) 
However, they did not listen, but continued to do according to their former customs.

(2 Kings 17:1) 
In the twelfth year of King Achaz of Judah, Osee, the son of Ela, began his reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for nine years.

(2 Kings 17:2) 
And Osee committed evil acts in the presence of the Lord, though not to the same degree as the previous kings of Israel before him.

(2 Kings 17:3) 
Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Osee, and Osee became Salmanasar's vassal and paid him annual tribute.

(2 Kings 17:4) 
But the king of the Assyrians discovered that Osee was secretly conspiring against him, sending messengers to King Sua of Egypt. Osee also stopped paying the tribute he used to send every year. So the king of Assyria besieged Osee and imprisoned him.

(2 Kings 17:5) 
The king of Assyria then marched throughout all the land of Israel, and when he reached Samaria, he besieged it for three years.

(2 Kings 17:6) 
In the ninth year of Osee's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried the people of Israel away as exiles to Assyria. He settled them in Hala and in Habor, near the Gozan River, and in the cities of the Medes.

(2 Kings 17:7) 
This happened because the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, the One who had brought them out of the land of Egypt and delivered them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Yet they worshipped other gods.

(2 Kings 17:8) 
They also followed the customs of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel, and the customs that the kings of Israel had themselves established.

(2 Kings 17:9) 
The children of Israel secretly committed acts against the Lord their God that were not right. They built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the watchman's tower to the fortified city.

(2 Kings 17:10) 
They set up sacred pillars and wooden idols for themselves on every high hill and under every green tree.

(2 Kings 17:11) 
There, on those altars, they burned incense in the manner of the pagan nations whom the Lord had removed from before them. They committed very wicked deeds, provoking the Lord to anger.

(2 Kings 17:12) 
They worshipped filthy idols, concerning which the Lord had explicitly commanded them not to engage in such practices.

(2 Kings 17:13) 
The Lord had warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and seers, saying: "Turn away from your wicked ways, and keep My commandments and My ceremonies, according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and as I sent to you through the hand of My servants, the prophets."

(2 Kings 17:14) 
But they would not listen; instead, they stiffened their necks, just like their fathers had, who refused to obey the Lord their God.

(2 Kings 17:15) 
They rejected His statutes, and the covenant He had made with their fathers, and the warnings He had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the pagan nations around them, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them not to act like them.

(2 Kings 17:16) 
They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They cast for themselves two calves out of metal, and made wooden idols, and worshipped all the heavenly bodies—the entire host of the universe—and served Baal.

(2 Kings 17:17) 
They sacrificed their sons and daughters in fire, and devoted themselves to divination and omens. They committed much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.

(2 Kings 17:18) 
The Lord became intensely angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah remained.

(2 Kings 17:19) 
Yet even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God. Instead, they followed the superstitious practices that Israel had established.

(2 Kings 17:20) 
So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted them, and gave them into the hand of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence.

(2 Kings 17:21) 
From the time that Israel split from the house of David and appointed Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, as their king, Jeroboam led Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.

(2 Kings 17:22) 
The children of Israel continued in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and they did not turn away from them.

(2 Kings 17:23) 
Until the Lord finally removed Israel from His sight, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, where they remain to this very day.

(2 Kings 17:24) 
The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cutha, Avah, Emath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the children of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.

(2 Kings 17:25) 
When they first settled there, these people did not fear the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.

(2 Kings 17:26) 
Then it was reported to the king of Assyria, saying: "The nations whom you have relocated and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the laws of the God of that land. Therefore, the Lord has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them, because these people do not know the proper way to worship the God of that land."

(2 Kings 17:27) 
So the king of Assyria commanded, saying: "Send back one of the priests whom you brought as captives from there. Let him go and live among them and teach them the laws of the God of the land."

(2 Kings 17:28) 
So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria came and settled in Bethel. He taught them how they should worship the Lord, the true God.

(2 Kings 17:29) 
Yet, each of the new nations made their own gods. They placed these gods in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had originally built, each nation in the cities where they lived.

(2 Kings 17:30) 
For the men from Babylon made Succoth-benoth. The men from Cutha made Nergal. The men from Hamath made Ashima.

(2 Kings 17:31) 
The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the people from Sepharvaim burned their children as offerings in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

(2 Kings 17:32) 
Even though they were worshipping the Lord, they also appointed priests for their high places from among themselves—these were not true priests of God—and these false priests served in the shrines of the high places.

(2 Kings 17:33) 
While they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods, according to the custom of the nations from which they had been brought to Samaria.

(2 Kings 17:34) 
To this very day, they continue to practice their former customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they keep His ceremonies, His judgments, His law, or the commandment which the Lord had given to the children of Jacob, whom He had named Israel.

(2 Kings 17:35) 
The Lord had made a covenant with them and commanded them, saying: "You shall not fear other gods, nor worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them."

(2 Kings 17:36) 
But the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him alone you shall sacrifice.

(2 Kings 17:37) 
And the ceremonies, the judgments, the law, and the commandments which He wrote for you, you shall diligently keep and perform forever. And you shall not fear other gods.

(2 Kings 17:38) 
And the covenant that I made with you, do not forget it. You shall not worship other gods.

(2 Kings 17:39) 
But you shall fear the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.

(2 Kings 17:40) 
Yet these people did not listen to the Lord's commands. Instead, they continued to act according to their former, unholy customs.

(2 Kings 17:1) 
In the twelfth year that Achaz was king of Judah, Osee, the son of Ela, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for nine years.

(2 Kings 17:2) 
And Osee did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. His wickedness was not like the kings of Israel who had been before him, but still evil.

(2 Kings 17:3) 
Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Osee. Osee became his servant and had to pay tribute to him.

(2 Kings 17:4) 
But the king of the Assyrians discovered that Osee was conspiring for help. He had sent messengers to King Sua of Egypt and had stopped paying the annual tribute he used to pay. So, the king of Assyria besieged Osee and put him in prison.

(2 Kings 17:5) 
The Assyrian king then went up and laid waste to all the land of Israel, and he came to Samaria, the capital city, and besieged it for three years.

(2 Kings 17:6) 
In the ninth year of Osee’s reign, the king of the Assyrians captured Samaria. He then deported the people of Israel to Assyria, settling them in Hala, and in Habor by the Gozan River, and in the cities of the Medes. This was the end of the Northern Kingdom.

(2 Kings 17:7) 
This all happened because the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God. He was the God who had delivered them from the land of Egypt, from the tyranny of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. But they chose to worship foreign gods instead.

(2 Kings 17:8) 
They had walked according to the rituals of the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel, and according to the customs that their own kings of Israel had established. Because of this, the Israelites themselves had behaved in exactly the same way as those pagans.

(2 Kings 17:9) 
The children of Israel had also spoken things that were not right against the Lord their God, and they had built high places for idol worship in all their cities—everywhere from the watchtowers of shepherds to the fortified cities.

(2 Kings 17:10) 
They had set up pillars and sacred groves for idol worship on every high hill and under every shady tree, even though God had forbidden these practices.

(2 Kings 17:11) 
There, on these altars, they burned incense just like the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out from before them. They committed the worst abominations, constantly provoking the Lord to anger.

(2 Kings 17:12) 
They worshipped all the defiling idols and did everything that the Lord had specifically commanded them not to do.

(2 Kings 17:13) 
The Lord had solemnly warned both Israel and Judah through all His prophets and seers, saying: "Turn back from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My ceremonies, according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers. Do as I sent to you through the hands of My servants, the prophets."

(2 Kings 17:14) 
But they refused to listen. Instead, they stiffened their necks, just like their fathers had, those who had refused to obey the Lord their God.

(2 Kings 17:15) 
They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, and they ignored the warnings by which He had testified to them. They pursued empty idols and behaved in empty ways, following the pagan nations around them, concerning whom the Lord had explicitly commanded them not to act like those nations.

(2 Kings 17:16) 
They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They made two molten calves for themselves, and they worshipped Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the host of heaven—the stars and planets which were worshipped as gods. They also served Baal.

(2 Kings 17:17) 
They made their sons and their daughters pass through fire as offerings to false gods. They practiced divination and used omens, giving themselves over to doing evil in the sight of the Lord, constantly provoking Him to anger.

(2 Kings 17:18) 
So the Lord became extremely angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah was left.

(2 Kings 17:19) 
Yet even Judah itself did not keep the commandments of the Lord its God. Indeed, they walked in the same errors that Israel had committed.

(2 Kings 17:20) 
The Lord then rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicting them and delivering them into the hands of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence entirely.

(2 Kings 17:21) 
For Israel had indeed been torn away from the house of David. They made Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, their king. He then turned Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.

(2 Kings 17:22) 
And the children of Israel continued to walk in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed. They never departed from these sins,

(2 Kings 17:23) 
until the Lord finally removed Israel from His sight, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. So, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, and they remain there to this very day.

(2 Kings 17:24) 
Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, from Cutha, from Ava, from Emath, and from Sepharvaim. He settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the children of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.

(2 Kings 17:25) 
When they first began to live there, they did not fear the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.

(2 Kings 17:26) 
So it was reported to the king of Assyria, saying: "The nations whom you have deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the statutes of the God of the land. Because of this, the Lord has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because these people do not know the custom of the God of the land."

(2 Kings 17:27) 
The king of Assyria then commanded, saying: "Bring back one of the priests whom you took captive from there. Let him go and live with them, and teach them the statutes of the God of the land."

(2 Kings 17:28) 
So one of the priests who had been taken captive from Samaria came and lived in Bethel. He taught them how they should worship the Lord.

(2 Kings 17:29) 
But each nation still made its own gods in each of their cities. They put these idols in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had built, each nation doing so in the cities where they lived.

(2 Kings 17:30) 
For example, the men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men from Cutha made Nergal, and the men from Emath made Ashima.

(2 Kings 17:31) 
Furthermore, the Avvites made Nibaz and Tartak. Those from Sepharvaim even burned their children in fire as offerings to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

(2 Kings 17:32) 
Nevertheless, they also worshipped the Lord. They appointed priests for their high places from among their own people, and these priests served in the shrines of the high places.

(2 Kings 17:33) 
So, while they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from which they had been brought. This syncretism was an abomination to God.

(2 Kings 17:34) 
To this very day, they continue to do things according to their old customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they observe His ceremonies, or His judgments, or His Law, or the commandment that the Lord had given to the children of Jacob, whom He had named Israel.

(2 Kings 17:35) 
For God had made a covenant with the Israelites and had commanded them, saying: "You shall not worship foreign gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor offer sacrifices to them. You must worship only Me."

(2 Kings 17:36) 
But you shall worship the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall worship Him alone and offer sacrifices to Him alone.

(2 Kings 17:37) 
And you shall carefully observe the ceremonies, the judgments, the Law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, so that you may do them at all times. You shall not fear foreign gods.

(2 Kings 17:38) 
And you shall not forget the covenant that I made with you, nor shall you worship foreign gods.

(2 Kings 17:39) 
Instead, you shall worship the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.

(2 Kings 17:40) 
But they did not listen. Instead, they continued to do things according to their old, sinful customs.

(2 Kings 18:1) 
In the third year that Osee, the son of Ela, was king over Israel, Ezechias, the son of Achaz, began to reign as king over Juda.

(2 Kings 18:2) 
He was twenty-five years old when he started his reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, daughter of Zacharias.

(2 Kings 18:3) 
And he did what was good and pleasing before the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done in all things.

(2 Kings 18:4) 
He himself tore down the high places of idolatry, broke apart the pagan statues, cut down the Asherah poles, and crushed the bronze serpent that Moses had made. This was because, up until that time, the sons of Israel had been burning incense to it, and he called it Nohestan, meaning "a piece of bronze."

(2 Kings 18:5) 
He placed his hope and trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no king like him among all the kings of Juda after him, nor among those who came before him.

(2 Kings 18:6) 
And he held fast to the Lord, not departing from His ways, and he kept His commandments, which He had commanded to Moses.

(2 Kings 18:7) 
For this reason, the Lord was with him. And in all that he undertook, he acted prosperously. He also rebelled against the king of the Assyrians and no longer served him.

(2 Kings 18:8) 
He himself struck down the Philistines all the way to Gaza, conquering all their borders, from the watchtower of the shepherds to the fortified city.

(2 Kings 18:9) 
In the fourth year of King Ezechias' reign, which was the seventh year that Osee, the son of Ela, was king of Israel, Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, went up against Samaria and besieged it.

(2 Kings 18:10) 
And he captured it after three years, in the sixth year of Ezechias' reign, which was the ninth year that Osee was king of Israel. That is when Samaria was taken.

(2 Kings 18:11) 
And Salmanasar exiled the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Hala and by the Habor River, which is in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

(2 Kings 18:12) 
This happened because they had not listened to the voice of the Lord their God but had violated His covenant. They did not listen to or obey all the commands that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.

(2 Kings 18:13) 
In the fourteenth year of King Ezechias' reign, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, marched against all the fortified cities of Juda and captured them.

(2 Kings 18:14) 
Then Ezechias, the king of Juda, sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians in Lachis, saying, "I have sinned; withdraw from me, and I will bear whatever you impose upon me." So the king of the Assyrians demanded from Ezechias, the king of Juda, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

(2 Kings 18:15) 
And Ezechias gave him all the silver that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.

(2 Kings 18:16) 
At that time, Ezechias broke off the doors of the temple of the Lord and the gold plates that he himself had affixed to them, and he gave them to the king of the Assyrians.

(2 Kings 18:17) 
But the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan, Rabsaris, and Rabsaces from Lachis to King Ezechias with a great army to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came to Jerusalem and stood by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road of the fuller's field.

(2 Kings 18:18) 
And they called out for the king. But Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the household, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to them instead.

(2 Kings 18:19) 
And Rabsaces said to them, "Speak to Ezechias: 'Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence in which you trust?'"

(2 Kings 18:20) 
"'Perhaps you have devised a plan and gathered strength to wage war. In what do you trust that you dare to rebel?'"

(2 Kings 18:21) 
"'Are you relying on that broken reed of a staff, Egypt, upon which if a man leans, it will shatter and pierce his hand? Such is Pharao, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.'"

(2 Kings 18:22) 
"'But if you answer me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is it not He whose high places and altars Ezechias has removed, telling Juda and Jerusalem, "You shall worship before these altars in Jerusalem"?'"

(2 Kings 18:23) 
"'Now therefore, give a pledge to my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you can provide riders for them yourself.'"

(2 Kings 18:24) 
"'And how can you resist even one of the least of my master's servants? Do you have confidence in Egypt because of their chariots and horsemen?'"

(2 Kings 18:25) 
"'Have I come up to this place to destroy it without the Lord's permission? The Lord Himself said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it."'

(2 Kings 18:26) 
Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces, "We beg you to speak to your servants in Aramaic, because we understand that language. Do not speak to us in the language of Juda while the people on the wall are listening."

(2 Kings 18:27) 
And Rabsaces answered them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Was it not rather to the men who sit on the wall, so that they might eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you?" This crude statement was meant to provoke fear and disgust among the common people.

(2 Kings 18:28) 
So Rabsaces stood up and cried out with a loud voice in the language of Juda, saying, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians!"

(2 Kings 18:29) 
"Thus says the king: 'Do not let Ezechias deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand.'"

(2 Kings 18:30) 
"'Nor let him make you trust in the Lord, saying, "The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be handed over to the king of the Assyrians."'

(2 Kings 18:31) 
"'Do not listen to Ezechias! For thus says the king of the Assyrians: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from his own vineyard and from his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cisterns.'"

(2 Kings 18:32) 
"'Until I come and take you away to a land that is like your own land—a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and oil and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Ezechias, who deceives you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us."'

(2 Kings 18:33) 
"'Have any of the gods of the nations truly delivered their land from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?'"

(2 Kings 18:34) 
"'Where are the gods of Emath and Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Ana, and Ava? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?'"

(2 Kings 18:35) 
"'Which are the gods among all the lands that have delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord might be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'"

(2 Kings 18:36) 
But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, for the king had commanded them, saying, "Do not answer him."

(2 Kings 18:37) 
So Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the household, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces.

(2 Kings 18:1) 
In the third year of King Hosea, the son of Elah, who was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, Hezekiah, the son of King Ahaz, began his reign over the southern kingdom of Judah.

(2 Kings 18:2) 
Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he started to reign, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.

(2 Kings 18:3) 
Hezekiah lived a life that pleased the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done.

(2 Kings 18:4) 
Hezekiah destroyed the pagan high places, shattered the idol statues, cut down the Asherah poles used for idolatry, and broke into pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made. Even up to that time, the people of Israel had been burning incense to it, worshipping it as an idol. Hezekiah called it Nehushtan, which means 'a piece of bronze'.

(2 Kings 18:5) 
Hezekiah placed his trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. Among all the kings of Judah, there was no one like him, neither before him nor after him.

(2 Kings 18:6) 
He remained faithful to the Lord and did not turn away from following Him. He obeyed the commandments that the Lord had given to Moses.

(2 Kings 18:7) 
Because of this, the Lord was with him, and Hezekiah prospered in everything he undertook. He also rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him any longer.

(2 Kings 18:8) 
Hezekiah attacked and defeated the Philistines, conquering their territory all the way to Gaza and its borders, from the watchtowers of the small villages to the fortified cities.

(2 Kings 18:9) 
In the fourth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, which was also the seventh year of Hosea, the son of Elah, king of the northern kingdom of Israel, Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, marched up against Samaria and laid siege to it.

(2 Kings 18:10) 
After three years, Shalmaneser captured Samaria. This happened in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of King Hosea of the northern kingdom of Israel.

(2 Kings 18:11) 
The Assyrian king then deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, and along the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes—a historical event that marked the end of the northern kingdom.

(2 Kings 18:12) 
This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. They had broken His covenant and had not obeyed any of the commandments that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.

(2 Kings 18:13) 
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, marched up and attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

(2 Kings 18:14) 
Then King Hezekiah of Judah sent messengers to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying: "I have sinned. Withdraw your forces from me, and whatever tribute you demand, I will pay." So the king of Assyria imposed upon King Hezekiah of Judah a payment of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

(2 Kings 18:15) 
Hezekiah gave him all the silver that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.

(2 Kings 18:16) 
At that time, Hezekiah even stripped the gold from the doors of the Lord's Temple and from the doorposts that he himself had overlaid with gold, and he gave it all to the king of Assyria.

(2 Kings 18:17) 
But the king of Assyria sent his chief commander, his chief officer, and his field commander from Lachish with a large army to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When they had marched up, they arrived at Jerusalem and took up a position by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road to the Washerman's Field.

(2 Kings 18:18) 
They called for the king. So Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet them.

(2 Kings 18:19) 
Then the field commander spoke to them, saying: "Tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is this confidence in which you trust, that you think can save you?'"

(2 Kings 18:20) 
"You might think you have a strategy or the resources to prepare for war, but tell me, on what do you rely that you dare to defy me?"

(2 Kings 18:21) 
"Are you perhaps relying on that broken reed, Egypt, upon which if a man leans, it splinters and pierces his hand? That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is to all who trust in him."

(2 Kings 18:22) 
"But if you say to me, 'We trust in the Lord our God,' then I ask: 'Is this not the God whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And Hezekiah commanded Judah and Jerusalem to worship only before this one altar in Jerusalem?'"

(2 Kings 18:23) 
"Now, therefore, make a wager with my lord, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses, if you can find enough riders for them from among your people."

(2 Kings 18:24) 
"How then can you resist even one of my master's least significant officials? You must be relying on Egypt for chariots and horsemen, as you have no strength of your own."

(2 Kings 18:25) 
"Furthermore, do you think I have come up against this place to destroy it without the Lord's will? No, the Lord Himself said to me: 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"

(2 Kings 18:26) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander: "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah while the people who are on the wall are listening, as it will demoralize them."

(2 Kings 18:27) 
But the field commander replied to them: "Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you? Is it not also to the men who are sitting on the wall, who will soon be forced to eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you, because of the siege?"

(2 Kings 18:28) 
So the field commander stood up and shouted in a loud voice, in the language of Judah, saying: "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"

(2 Kings 18:29) 
"This is what the king says: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you from my hand.'"

(2 Kings 18:30) 
"Nor should he persuade you to rely on the Lord, saying: 'The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'"

(2 Kings 18:31) 
"Do not listen to Hezekiah. For this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make peace with me and surrender to me. Then each of you will be able to enjoy your own vineyard and fig tree, and drink water from your own cisterns—a promise of prosperity under Assyrian rule.'"

(2 Kings 18:32) 
"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah, who deceives you by saying: 'The Lord will deliver us.'"

(2 Kings 18:33) 
"Have the gods of any of the nations ever delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"

(2 Kings 18:34) 
"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?"

(2 Kings 18:35) 
"Which of all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand, that the Lord could deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"

(2 Kings 18:36) 
But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, for the king had given a strict command: "Do not answer him."

(2 Kings 18:37) 
Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in an expression of grief, and reported to him the words of the field commander.

(2 Kings 18:1) 
It was during the third year that Osee, the son of Ela, ruled as king of Israel, when Ezechias, the son of Achaz, began to reign as king of Judah.

(2 Kings 18:2) 
Ezechias was twenty-five years old when he began his reign, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi, the daughter of Zacharias.

(2 Kings 18:3) 
He did what was good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as his father David had done in all things.

(2 Kings 18:4) 
It was Ezechias who destroyed the high places of idolatry, broke apart the pagan statues, cut down the Asherah poles, and crushed the bronze serpent that Moses had made. The reason he did this was because, up to that very time, the children of Israel were still offering incense to it, and he named it Nohestan, meaning a mere piece of bronze.

(2 Kings 18:5) 
Ezechias placed his hope and trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. No king like him, among all the kings of Judah, arose after him, nor among those who ruled before him.

(2 Kings 18:6) 
He remained faithful to the Lord and did not turn away from His commandments. He kept all the commands that the Lord had given to Moses.

(2 Kings 18:7) 
The Lord was with him, and in everything he undertook, he acted with wisdom. He even rebelled against the king of the Assyrians and refused to serve him.

(2 Kings 18:8) 
It was Ezechias who struck down the Philistines, conquering all their territory from the watchtowers of their outposts all the way to the fortified cities, extending his victory even to Gaza.

(2 Kings 18:9) 
In the fourth year of King Ezechias’ reign — which was also the seventh year that Osee, the son of Ela, ruled as king of Israel — Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Samaria and besieged the city.

(2 Kings 18:10) 
And after three years of siege, Salmanasar took the city. This occurred in the sixth year of Ezechias’ reign, which was the ninth year that Osee ruled as king of Israel, when Samaria was finally captured.

(2 Kings 18:11) 
Then the king of Assyria deported the people of Israel into Assyria, settling them in Hala, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

(2 Kings 18:12) 
This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. Instead, they broke His covenant and did not obey or follow any of the commandments that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.

(2 Kings 18:13) 
In the fourteenth year of King Ezechias’ reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, marched against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

(2 Kings 18:14) 
At that time, Ezechias, the king of Judah, sent messengers to the king of Assyria in Lachis, saying, "I have sinned. Withdraw from me, and whatever you impose on me, I will bear it." So the king of Assyria demanded from Ezechias, the king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

(2 Kings 18:15) 
And Ezechias gave him all the silver that could be found in the House of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.

(2 Kings 18:16) 
At that same time, Ezechias cut off the gold from the doors of the Lord’s temple and from the gold plates which he himself had affixed to them, and he gave them to the king of Assyria.

(2 Kings 18:17) 
Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent Tharthan, Rabsaris, and Rabsacen from Lachis to King Ezechias with a powerful army against Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came to Jerusalem and took up positions by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road to the Fuller’s Field.

(2 Kings 18:18) 
They called for the king, and so Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the palace, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet them.

(2 Kings 18:19) 
Then Rabsacen said to them, "Speak to Ezechias: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is this confidence in which you are trusting?’"

(2 Kings 18:20) 
“‘Perhaps you have formed a plan to prepare yourself for war, but in what do you place your trust that you dare to defy me?’"

(2 Kings 18:21) 
“‘Do you truly hope and trust in Egypt, that broken reed staff, which if a man leans on it, will splinter and pierce his hand? That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is like to all who trust in him.’"

(2 Kings 18:22) 
“‘But if you say to me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is He not the very one whose high places and altars Ezechias removed? Did Ezechias not command Judah and Jerusalem saying, "You shall worship only before this single altar in Jerusalem?"’"

(2 Kings 18:23) 
“‘Now therefore, make a pledge to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to provide riders for them from your own forces.’"

(2 Kings 18:24) 
“‘How then can you resist even one of the least of my master’s servants? Do you truly place your trust in Egypt because of their chariots and horsemen?’"

(2 Kings 18:25) 
“‘Have I come up against this place to destroy it without the Lord’s approval? No! The Lord Himself said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it."’"

(2 Kings 18:26) 
Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsacen, "We beg you, please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah while the people who are on the wall are listening."

(2 Kings 18:27) 
But Rabsacen answered them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you alone to speak these words? Is it not rather to the men who sit on the wall, so that they may be forced to eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you?"

(2 Kings 18:28) 
So Rabsacen stood and cried out with a loud voice in the language of Judah, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!"

(2 Kings 18:29) 
“‘This is what the king says: "Do not let Ezechias deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand."’"

(2 Kings 18:30) 
“‘Nor let him persuade you to trust in the Lord by saying, "The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."’"

(2 Kings 18:31) 
“‘Do not listen to Ezechias! For this is what the king of Assyria says: "Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will be able to eat from your own vine and your own fig tree, and drink water from your own cisterns.’"

(2 Kings 18:32) 
“‘Until I come and take you away to a land that is like your own land — a land of grain and wine, a land of fruit, olive groves, olive oil, and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Ezechias, who deceives you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us."’"

(2 Kings 18:33) 
“‘Have the gods of the other nations ever delivered their own land from the hand of the king of Assyria?’"

(2 Kings 18:34) 
“‘Where are the gods of Emath and Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Ana, and Ava? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?’"

(2 Kings 18:35) 
“‘Which of all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand, that the Lord should be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’"

(2 Kings 18:36) 
But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, because the king’s command was clear: "Do not answer him."

(2 Kings 18:37) 
Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the palace, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of Rabsacen.

(2 Kings 19:1) 
When King Hezekiah heard this news, he tore his garments to show his great distress, wrapped himself in sackcloth to show his sorrow and repentance, and went into the Temple of the Lord to pray.

(2 Kings 19:2) 
Then King Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the steward of his palace, and Shebna the royal scribe, and the senior priests (all of them clothed in sackcloth, just as the King was, to show their shared sorrow), to the Prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.

(2 Kings 19:3) 
And they delivered the message to him, saying: 'King Hezekiah says this: This is a day of tremendous anguish, of God's rebuke, and of blasphemy against the True God. It is as if a woman is in labor, and the children are ready to be born, but she has no strength left to deliver them. We are in a critical situation, but we are too weak to bring about our own rescue.'

(2 Kings 19:4) 
'Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Sennacherib, whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will rebuke him for the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayers for the small remnant that remains of us.'

(2 Kings 19:5) 
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

(2 Kings 19:6) 
And Isaiah said to them: 'Say this to your master: The Lord says this: Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.'

(2 Kings 19:7) 
'Behold, I will put a spirit within him (a divine impulse of fear or decision), and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And there, in his own land, I will cause him to be struck down by the sword.'

(2 Kings 19:8) 
So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, because he had moved his forces from Lachish.

(2 Kings 19:9) 
For Sennacherib had heard a report about Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, that he had set out to fight against him. And so, the king of Assyria again sent messengers to King Hezekiah, saying:

(2 Kings 19:10) 
'Say this to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying: Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'

(2 Kings 19:11) 
'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other lands, how they utterly destroyed them. And do you think you can be delivered?'

(2 Kings 19:12) 
'Did the gods of the nations deliver those whom my fathers destroyed, like Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?'

(2 Kings 19:13) 
'Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivvah?'

(2 Kings 19:14) 
And Hezekiah received the letters (the written messages) from the hand of the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the Temple of the Lord and spread the letters out before the Lord.

(2 Kings 19:15) 
And Hezekiah prayed in His presence, saying: 'O Lord, God of Israel, Who sits enthroned above the Cherubim (representing Your divine presence), You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You created the entire universe and the earth.'

(2 Kings 19:16) 
'Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear! Open Your eyes, O Lord, and see! And listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent his messengers to insult the living God.'

(2 Kings 19:17) 
'It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands, destroying all of them.'

(2 Kings 19:18) 
'And they threw the pagan gods of those nations into the fire, for those were not truly gods, but merely the work of human hands, made of wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians were able to destroy them.'

(2 Kings 19:19) 
'Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are the Lord God.'

(2 Kings 19:20) 
Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus says the Lord God of Israel: I have heard your prayer regarding Sennacherib, the king of Assyria.'

(2 Kings 19:21) 
'This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion (Jerusalem) despises you and mocks you; the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you (in derision).'

(2 Kings 19:22) 
'Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes so proudly to the heavens? It was against the Holy One of Israel!'

(2 Kings 19:23) 
'By the hand of your messengers, you have insulted the Lord, and you said: “With the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended the highest mountains, to the peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest fir trees. I penetrated its farthest reaches, even to its thickest forest, like the forest of Carmel.”'

(2 Kings 19:24) 
'“I myself have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the rivers of the besieged lands.”'

(2 Kings 19:25) 
'Have you not heard that I (God) have prepared this from long ago? From ancient days, I (God) planned it, and now I (God) have brought it to pass. It was I who decreed that fortified cities would become heaps of rubble.'

(2 Kings 19:26) 
'And those who lived in those cities were put to shame and trembled with fear. They became like the grass of the field, and like the tender herb of the pasture, and like the dry grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows tall.'

(2 Kings 19:27) 
'I (God) know your dwelling, and your going out, and your coming in, and your way of life. All your movements and intentions were known to Me.'

(2 Kings 19:28) 
'Because you have raged against Me, and your arrogance has reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips, and I will lead you back by the very way you came.'

(2 Kings 19:29) 
'And this will be a sign to you, Hezekiah: This year, you will eat what grows of itself (from the scattered seeds of the previous harvest); and in the second year, you will eat what springs up from that. But in the third year, you will sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.'

(2 Kings 19:30) 
'And the remnant that escapes from the house of Judah and remains will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.'

(2 Kings 19:31) 
'For from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and from Mount Zion will come those who are saved. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.'

(2 Kings 19:32) 
'Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city, nor will he shoot an arrow into it, nor will he bring a shield against it, nor will he build up a siege ramp against it.'

(2 Kings 19:33) 
'By the way he came, by the same way he will return. And this city he will not enter, declares the Lord.'

(2 Kings 19:34) 
'For I will protect this city and save it, for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.'

(2 Kings 19:35) 
And it came to pass that very night, the Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose early in the morning, they saw all the bodies of the dead.

(2 Kings 19:36) 
So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, broke camp and departed. He returned to his land and remained in Nineveh.

(2 Kings 19:37) 
And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his pagan god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. They then fled into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 19:1) 
When King Hezekiah heard this message of blasphemy and threat, he tore his royal garments in a display of profound grief and lamentation. He then wrapped himself in sackcloth, as a visible sign of his humility and penitence before God. After this, he immediately went into the Temple of the Lord to seek divine counsel.

(2 Kings 19:2) 
King Hezekiah sent Eliakim, who was the royal steward in charge of the palace, along with Shebna the royal secretary, and the most senior priests—all of whom were also dressed in sackcloth as a sign of their shared national distress—to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, to seek a prophetic word from God.

(2 Kings 19:3) 
These men then reported to Isaiah King Hezekiah's words: 'This day is a day of deep affliction, of severe rebuke from God, and of direct blasphemy against His holy Name, hurled by the Assyrians. Our nation is in such a desperate state, like a woman in labor who has reached the point of birth but lacks the strength to deliver her child—we are at the brink of destruction with no power to save ourselves.'

(2 Kings 19:4) 
'Perhaps the Lord your God has heard all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the King of Assyria, his master, sent to mock and insult the living God, and the Lord your God will condemn these words that He heard: please, then, raise up a fervent prayer for the small remnant of our people who are still left and found alive.'

(2 Kings 19:5) 
So, the servants of King Hezekiah—Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests—came before the prophet Isaiah.

(2 Kings 19:6) 
And Isaiah declared to them, 'Tell your master, King Hezekiah, this message from the Lord: 'Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard—the blasphemous insults uttered against Me by the servants of the King of Assyria. These are mere human words, but they are an affront to the living God.''

(2 Kings 19:7) 
'Indeed, I am now going to put a spirit into him—a spirit of fear and urgency—so that when he hears a report about his homeland, he will immediately return to his own country. And there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall by the sword; he will meet a violent end.'

(2 Kings 19:8) 
So Rabshakeh, the Assyrian general, returned to his king, Sennacherib, and found him battling near Libnah. This was because Rabshakeh had already heard that the Assyrian king had withdrawn from his siege of Lachish.

(2 Kings 19:9) 
Now, King Sennacherib had received a report concerning Tirhakah, the King of Ethiopia (also known as the Kushite King), stating: 'Indeed, he has marched out to wage war against you.' Because of this new threat, Sennacherib once again sent messengers to King Hezekiah of Judah, instructing them with a new message, saying:

(2 Kings 19:10) 
'Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah: 'Do not let your God, in whom you place your trust and confidence, deceive you by saying: 'Jerusalem will not be handed over into the power of the King of Assyria.' Do not be misled by such false hope.''

(2 Kings 19:11) 
'Look, you have heard and know very well what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries they have conquered, and how utterly and powerfully they have devastated them and brought them to ruin. So, do you truly believe that you alone will be able to be delivered from our grasp?'

(2 Kings 19:12) 
'Have the false gods of the nations—each one of them—been able to deliver their people whom my forefathers destroyed? Have they saved Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, or the people of Eden who lived in Telassar? No, they have not!'

(2 Kings 19:13) 
'Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad now? And where is the king of the city of Sepharvaim? And where are the kings of Hena and Ivvah? They are all gone, conquered by my armies, and their gods could not save them!'

(2 Kings 19:14) 
King Hezekiah received these threatening letters from the messengers and read their blasphemous contents. He then went up into the Temple of the Lord, and there, in a powerful act of supplication and faith, Hezekiah spread out the letters before the Lord God.

(2 Kings 19:15) 
And Hezekiah prayed fervently in the sight of the Lord, declaring: 'O Lord, the God of Israel, You who are enthroned above the cherubim—You alone are the one true God of all the kingdoms and nations of the earth. You are the Almighty Creator, for You made the entire universe and the earth!'

(2 Kings 19:16) 
'Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear our plea! Open Your divine eyes, O Lord, and see our distress! Hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to mock and insult You, the living God, and thereby bring shame upon us, Your people.'

(2 Kings 19:17) 
'It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have indeed laid waste to the nations and all their lands, just as their arrogant letter boasts.'

(2 Kings 19:18) 
'And they have thrown the false gods of those nations into the fire and destroyed them. But these so-called gods were not truly gods at all; they were merely the lifeless work of human hands, fashioned from wood and stone, and thus the Assyrians were able to easily destroy them.'

(2 Kings 19:19) 
'Now therefore, O Lord our God, we humbly pray: deliver us from the powerful hand of this Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Do this so that all the kingdoms and nations of the earth may come to know and acknowledge that You alone are the Lord God, the one true and living God!'

(2 Kings 19:20) 
Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent a message back to King Hezekiah, saying: 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I have heard your earnest prayer concerning Sennacherib, the King of Assyria. Your petition has reached My ears.''

(2 Kings 19:21) 
'This is the divine word which the Lord has spoken concerning Sennacherib: 'The virgin daughter of Zion—meaning the city of Jerusalem, pristine and undefiled by conquest—despises you and scoffs at your threats! The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head in defiant scorn at you, King Sennacherib!''

(2 Kings 19:22) 
'Whom have you mocked and insulted with your words? Against whom have you raised your voice in arrogance, and lifted your eyes in proud defiance? You have done this against the Holy One of Israel Himself!'

(2 Kings 19:23) 
'By the hands of your messengers, you have indeed mocked the Lord God, and you have arrogantly declared: 'With my vast chariots and my mighty army, I have ascended the highest mountain peaks, even the very summits of Lebanon! I have cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypress trees, and I have penetrated deep into its farthest reaches, into its most fertile forest, like its glorious Carmel!''

(2 Kings 19:24) 
'You have further boasted: 'I have personally dug wells and drunk foreign waters in conquered lands, and with the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the fortified streams of Egypt!' Your arrogance knows no bounds, thinking your power is limitless.

(2 Kings 19:25) 
'Have you not heard, King Sennacherib, that I, the Lord, have ordained this from long ago? From ancient times, I planned it, shaping and forming it according to My divine will. And now, I have brought it to pass: that you would turn fortified cities into piles of rubble, becoming a ruin of warring hills and strong cities, all as part of My grand design!'

(2 Kings 19:26) 
'Therefore, the inhabitants of those conquered lands had little power to resist; they were utterly dismayed and disgraced. They became like the grass of the field and the tender green plants, easily withered; like the thin grass on rooftops, scorched and dried up before it grows tall.'

(2 Kings 19:27) 
'But I, the Lord, know your every move: your comings and goings, your habitation, your entire way of life, and your journeying—I know all of it! And I also know the raging madness and fury that you direct against Me, the living God!'

(2 Kings 19:28) 
'Because you have raged against Me, and your arrogant boasting has ascended into My ears, I will place a hook in your nose and a bridle in your lips, just as one would do to a wild, untamed beast. And I will turn you back and lead you away along the very road by which you came, forcing your retreat!'

(2 Kings 19:29) 
'And this, O King Hezekiah, will be a miraculous sign for you and your people that My promise is true: This year, you will eat what grows naturally from scattered seeds left over from the previous harvest. And in the second year, you will eat what springs up from the ground on its own, without cultivation. But in the third year, you will once again be able to sow seed and reap a proper harvest, and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruits in peace.'

(2 Kings 19:30) 
'And the remnant that has escaped from the House of Judah—those who remain faithful and alive—will again take deep root downward into the land, and they will produce abundant fruit upward, signifying spiritual and physical prosperity.'

(2 Kings 19:31) 
'For from Jerusalem will come forth a saving remnant, and those who remain alive from Mount Zion—they will be preserved. The fervent zeal and passionate determination of the Lord of Hosts, the Commander of heavenly armies, will accomplish this divine intervention!'

(2 Kings 19:32) 
Therefore, this is what the Lord declares concerning the King of Assyria: 'He shall not enter this holy city of Jerusalem; he will not even shoot an arrow into it. No shield will be raised against it, nor will he build a siege ramp against its walls, for I will protect it absolutely.'

(2 Kings 19:33) 
'By the very road he came, by that same road will he return in retreat. He shall not enter this city,' declares the Lord, the Almighty God.

(2 Kings 19:34) 
'For I will protect this city, and I will save it, not for their merit, but for My own honor and glory, and for the sake of My loyal servant, King David, and the covenant I made with him.'

(2 Kings 19:35) 
So, it came to pass on that very night, that an angel of the Lord—a powerful heavenly messenger—went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian military camp. When the remaining Assyrians rose early the next morning, they looked out and saw all these vast numbers of dead bodies, realizing a catastrophic supernatural event had occurred.

(2 Kings 19:36) 
Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and departed immediately. He retreated from the land of Judah, returned to his own territory, and settled in his capital city, Nineveh.

(2 Kings 19:37) 
And it happened that while Sennacherib was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his demon-god, his own sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, struck him down with a sword and killed him. They then fled for their lives to the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, another of Sennacherib's sons, became king in his place.

(2 Kings 20:1) 
In those days, King Hezekiah became so sick he was going to die. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, went in to see him and said, "This is what the Lord says: Set your affairs in order, because you will die and not live."

(2 Kings 20:2) 
Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying:

(2 Kings 20:3) 
"I beg you, Lord, please remember, I pray, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was pleasing in your sight." And Hezekiah wept with great sorrow.

(2 Kings 20:4) 
And it happened, before Isaiah had even left the middle part of the courtyard, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying:

(2 Kings 20:5) 
Go back, and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: "This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Indeed, I will add fifteen years to your life."

(2 Kings 20:6) 
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city.

(2 Kings 20:7) 
Then Isaiah said, "Bring a poultice of figs." When they brought it and applied it to his boil, he recovered.

(2 Kings 20:8) 
Now Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord on the third day?"

(2 Kings 20:9) 
Isaiah answered him, "This will be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do what He has promised: Do you want the shadow to advance ten steps, or to go back ten steps?"

(2 Kings 20:10) 
Hezekiah said, "It is easy for the shadow to move forward ten steps, but I do not want that. Instead, let the shadow move back ten steps."

(2 Kings 20:11) 
Then the prophet Isaiah called upon the Lord, and God made the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz go back ten steps, which it had already descended.

(2 Kings 20:12) 
At that time, Berodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, the king of the Babylonians, sent letters and gifts to King Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

(2 Kings 20:13) 
Hezekiah heard what they had to say, and then he showed them all the treasures of his palace: the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oils, his armory, and everything that could be found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

(2 Kings 20:14) 
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant land, from Babylon."

(2 Kings 20:15) 
Isaiah then asked, "What did they see in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They saw everything that is in my palace. There was nothing in my treasuries that I did not show them."

(2 Kings 20:16) 
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord."

(2 Kings 20:17) 
Behold, the days are coming when everything in your palace, and everything that your ancestors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.

(2 Kings 20:18) 
And some of your sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, will be taken and made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

(2 Kings 20:19) 
Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the Lord that you have spoken is good. Let there be peace and stability during my lifetime."

(2 Kings 20:20) 
As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct and brought water into the city—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 20:21) 
And Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and his son Manasseh reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 21:1) 
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign. He reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah.

(2 Kings 21:2) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.

(2 Kings 21:3) 
For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He set up altars for Baal and made sacred groves, just as Ahab, the king of Israel, had done. Manasseh also worshipped all the celestial bodies of the sky, serving them as gods.

(2 Kings 21:4) 
He built altars in the Temple of the Lord, regarding which the Lord had said: “In Jerusalem I will establish my presence.”

(2 Kings 21:5) 
He built altars for all the celestial bodies of the sky in both courtyards of the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 21:6) 
He also made his son pass through fire as a sacrifice, consulted diviners, practiced sorcery, engaged in witchcraft, and greatly multiplied those who consulted familiar spirits and wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.

(2 Kings 21:7) 
He placed an idol of the sacred grove, which he had made, in the Temple of the Lord. Regarding this Temple, the Lord had said to David and to his son Solomon: “In this Temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will establish my name forever.”

(2 Kings 21:8) 
And I will no longer allow the feet of Israel to wander from the land which I gave to their fathers—that is, if they will carefully observe my commandments and the entire Law that I commanded them through my servant Moses.

(2 Kings 21:9) 
But they did not listen. Instead, Manasseh misled them to do more evil than the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.

(2 Kings 21:10) 
Then the Lord spoke through His servants, the prophets, saying:

(2 Kings 21:11) 
“Because Manasseh, the king of Judah, has committed these most wicked abominations—doing more evil than all the Amorites before him—and has also made Judah sin with his idols,

(2 Kings 21:12) 
therefore, this is what the Lord God of Israel says: 'Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears about it will ring with terror.

(2 Kings 21:13) 
I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab. I will wipe away Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.

(2 Kings 21:14) 
And I will abandon the remnant of my heritage, delivering them into the hand of their enemies. They will become plunder and a prey to all their adversaries,

(2 Kings 21:15) 
because they have done evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this very day.’”

(2 Kings 21:16) 
Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from one end to the other. This was in addition to his sins by which he made Judah sin and do evil in the sight of the Lord.

(2 Kings 21:17) 
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and the sin he committed, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 21:18) 
Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the Garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 21:19) 
Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz, from Jotbah.

(2 Kings 21:20) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Manasseh had done.

(2 Kings 21:21) 
He walked in every way that his father had walked. He served the detestable idols that his father had served and worshipped them.

(2 Kings 21:22) 
He abandoned the Lord, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the Lord.

(2 Kings 21:23) 
Now the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.

(2 Kings 21:24) 
But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then they made his son Josiah king in his place.

(2 Kings 21:25) 
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 21:26) 
They buried him in his tomb in the Garden of Uzza. And his son Josiah reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 21:27) 
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah, from Bozkath.

(2 Kings 21:28) 
And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord. He walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.

(2 Kings 21:29) 
Now in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David. In the twelfth year of his reign, he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the sacred groves, the carved idols, and the molten images.

(2 Kings 21:30) 
Before him, they tore down the altars of the Baals, and he smashed the altars that were placed above them. He cut down the sacred groves and the carved idols, breaking them into pieces. He pulverized the idol fields and scattered their dust over the tombs of those who had offered sacrifices there.

(2 Kings 21:31) 
He also burned the altars of the idols all around, cut down the sacred groves, and crushed the carved and molten images into dust. He scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.

(2 Kings 21:32) 
He did likewise in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, destroying idolatry throughout the surrounding areas.

(2 Kings 21:33) 
When he returned to Jerusalem, passing through the Temple of the Lord, he found the book of the Law of the Lord given through Moses in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 21:34) 
This is what Hilkiah the priest found and gave to Shaphan the scribe, and he read it in the presence of the king.

(2 Kings 21:35) 
When the king heard the words of the Law of the Lord, he tore his garments and prayed to the Lord.

(2 Kings 21:36) 
Then he commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king’s servant, saying:

(2 Kings 21:37) 
“Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the Lord that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the words of the Lord to do everything written in this book.”

(2 Kings 21:38) 
So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Abdon, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her the words that had been previously said to them.

(2 Kings 21:39) 
And she answered them: “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me:

(2 Kings 21:40) 
“This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in this book which they have read before the king of Judah.

(2 Kings 22:1) 
Josias was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Idida, daughter of Adaja, from the town of Besecath.

(2 Kings 22:2) 
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. He walked in the full path of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.

(2 Kings 22:3) 
In the eighteenth year of King Josias's reign, the king sent Saphan, son of Asaliah, son of Messulam, who was the scribe of the Lord's Temple, saying:

(2 Kings 22:4) 
"Go to Helcias, the high priest. Tell him to assess the money that has been brought into the Lord's Temple. This money was collected by the doorkeepers from the people."

(2 Kings 22:5) 
"And let him give this money to the carpenters, and to the masons, and to those who cut stones. Let them also buy wood and cut stones so that they may repair and rebuild the Temple of the Lord."

(2 Kings 22:6) 
There was no accounting required with them for the money they received, because they acted with faithfulness and integrity.

(2 Kings 22:7) 
Then Helcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord." And Helcias gave the book to Saphan, who then read it.

(2 Kings 22:8) 
Saphan the scribe came to the king and reported what the king had commanded him. Afterwards, Saphan informed the king, saying, "Helcias the priest gave me a book." When Saphan read the book aloud before the king,

(2 Kings 22:9) 
and the king heard the words of the book, which was the Law of the Lord, he tore his clothes in grief and repentance.

(2 Kings 22:10) 
And he commanded Helcias the priest, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Achobor the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying:

(2 Kings 22:11) 
"Go and consult the Lord on my behalf, and on behalf of the people, and on behalf of all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For the great wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us, because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, so as to do all that is written and commanded for us."

(2 Kings 22:12) 
So Helcias the priest, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Saphan, and Asaiah, went to Olda the prophetess. She was the wife of Sellum, son of Thecue, son of Araas, the keeper of the vestments. She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her, seeking guidance.

(2 Kings 22:13) 
And she answered them, saying, "Thus says the Lord God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me:

(2 Kings 22:14) 
Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants—all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. This punishment will certainly come to pass."

(2 Kings 22:15) 
"This is because they have abandoned Me and have sacrificed to foreign gods, provoking Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore, My indignation has been kindled against this place, and it will not be extinguished."

(2 Kings 22:16) 
"But to the king of Judah, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus you shall say: 'Thus says the Lord God of Israel: Because you have heard the words of the scroll,

(2 Kings 22:17) 
and your heart was humbled, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard the words against this place and against its inhabitants—that they would become a desolation and a curse—and you tore your garments and wept before Me, I have heard you, says the Lord."

(2 Kings 22:18) 
"Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your tomb in peace. Your eyes shall not see all the evils which I am about to bring upon this place.'" And they reported to the king everything she had said.

(2 Kings 22:19) 
So the king sent messengers and gathered to himself all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 22:20) 
And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and all those who lived in Jerusalem went with him—the priests and the prophets, and all the people, from the least important to the greatest. And he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant, which had been found in the house of the Lord.

(2 Kings 22:1) 
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Idida, daughter of Adaja, from Besecath.

(2 Kings 22:2) 
He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and he walked in all the ways of his father David. He did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

(2 Kings 22:3) 
In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, who was the scribe of the Temple of the Lord. The king said to him:

(2 Kings 22:4) 
“Go to Hilkiah, the high priest, so that he may gather the money that has been brought into the Temple of the Lord by the doorkeepers, who were entrusted with keeping it safe.

(2 Kings 22:5) 
And let him give this money to the workmen, to the carpenters, and to the masons, who are repairing the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 22:6) 
And let them use the money to restore the walls, and to buy timber and cut stones for the repair of the places in the Temple of the Lord.”

(2 Kings 22:7) 
However, the money that they receive for this work is not to be accounted for, but it is to be given to them based on their authority and trustworthiness.

(2 Kings 22:8) 
Then Hilkiah, the high priest, said to Shaphan, the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.” Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and Shaphan read it.

(2 Kings 22:9) 
Shaphan, the scribe, came back to the king and reported what had been commanded. Furthermore, he informed the king, saying, “Your servants have given the money that was found in the house of the Lord to the workmen and to those who supervise the work in the Temple of the Lord.”

(2 Kings 22:10) 
Shaphan, the scribe, also told the king, saying, “Hilkiah, the priest, gave me a book.” And when Shaphan had read it in the presence of the king,

(2 Kings 22:11) 
and the king heard the words of the book of the Law of the Lord, he tore his garments in a sign of deep distress and repentance.

(2 Kings 22:12) 
Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying:

(2 Kings 22:13) 
“Go, and consult the Lord on my behalf, and on behalf of the people, and on behalf of all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For the wrath of the Lord is greatly kindled against us, because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us.”

(2 Kings 22:14) 
So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, who was the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter of the city. They spoke to her.

(2 Kings 22:15) 
And she answered them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me:

(2 Kings 22:16) 
Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.

(2 Kings 22:17) 
Because they have abandoned Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, provoking Me with all the works of their hands, My indignation will be kindled against this place, and it will not be extinguished.’

(2 Kings 22:18) 
But to the king of Judah, who sent you to consult the Lord, you shall say this: ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because you have heard the words of the book,

(2 Kings 22:19) 
and your heart was moved, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard the words against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse—and because you tore your garments and wept before Me—I also have heard it,’ says the Lord.

(2 Kings 22:20) 
Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place.” And they reported her words to the king.

(2 Kings 23:1) 
King Josiah then sent messengers, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered before him.

(2 Kings 23:2) 
The king went up to the Temple of the Lord, and with him were all the men of Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, from the youngest to the oldest. He read aloud to everyone the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:3) 
The king then stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord, promising to follow the Lord, to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His ceremonies with all his heart and all his soul, and to uphold the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people agreed to the covenant.

(2 Kings 23:4) 
The king then commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second rank, and the doorkeepers to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of the heavens—meaning, all the objects used for pagan worship. He burned these things outside Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.

(2 Kings 23:5) 
He abolished the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places throughout the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem. He also abolished those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of the heavens.

(2 Kings 23:6) 
He had the Asherah pole—a pagan idol—carried out from the Lord’s house, outside Jerusalem, into the Kidron Valley. He burned it there, ground it to dust, and threw the dust on the graves of the common people to defile them.

(2 Kings 23:7) 
He also tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes, which were in the house of the Lord, where women wove garments for the idol Asherah.

(2 Kings 23:8) 
He gathered all the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where these priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beersheba. He also tore down the altars at the gates, specifically the one at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was on the left side as one entered the gate.

(2 Kings 23:9) 
However, the priests from these high places were not allowed to ascend to the Lord’s altar in Jerusalem; instead, they ate unleavened bread among their fellow priests.

(2 Kings 23:10) 
He also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so that no one could consecrate his son or daughter by passing them through fire to Molech—a horrific pagan ritual.

(2 Kings 23:11) 
And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, located at the entrance of the house of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the storerooms. He also burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

(2 Kings 23:12) 
The king also tore down the altars that were on the roof of Ahaz’s upper chamber, which the kings of Judah had made. And he destroyed the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the house of the Lord. He ran from there, broke them into pieces, ground them to dust, and scattered the dust over the Kidron stream.

(2 Kings 23:13) 
The king also defiled the high places that were in Jerusalem, on the right side of the Mount of Corruption—meaning, the Mount of Olives. These had been built by King Solomon of Israel for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites; and for Molech, the idol of the Ammonites.

(2 Kings 23:14) 
He smashed the pagan pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with the bones of the dead—an act of severe defilement.

(2 Kings 23:15) 
Moreover, he also tore down the altar in Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat had built, the one who caused Israel to sin. He overthrew that altar and that high place. He burned the high place, ground it to dust, and burned the Asherah pole.

(2 Kings 23:16) 
Then Josiah turned and saw the tombs that were on the mountain there. He sent men to take the bones from the tombs, and he burned them on the altar, thus defiling it, just as the word of the Lord had declared through the man of God who had prophesied these very things.

(2 Kings 23:17) 
He asked, 'What is that monument I see?' The men of the city answered him, 'It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and foretold these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'

(2 Kings 23:18) 
And he said, 'Leave him alone; let no one disturb his bones.' So his bones remained untouched, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.

(2 Kings 23:19) 
Moreover, Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger. He dealt with them in the same way he had dealt with all the works he did in Bethel.

(2 Kings 23:20) 
He slaughtered all the priests of the high places who were there, sacrificing them on their own altars, and he burned human bones upon those altars to defile them thoroughly. Then he returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 23:21) 
Then the king commanded all the people, saying, 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, according to what is written in this book of the covenant.'

(2 Kings 23:22) 
Indeed, no such Passover had been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah,

(2 Kings 23:23) 
as it was observed for the Lord in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign.

(2 Kings 23:24) 
Furthermore, Josiah also removed the mediums, the spiritists, the household idols, the pagan images, and all the detestable things that had been in the land of Judah and Jerusalem. He did this to fulfill the words of the Law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:25) 
Before him, there was no king like him, who turned back to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.

(2 Kings 23:26) 
Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which He was angry against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.

(2 Kings 23:27) 
And the Lord said, 'I will also remove Judah from my sight, just as I removed Israel. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house about which I said, 'My Name shall be there.''

(2 Kings 23:28) 
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 23:29) 
In his days, Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to meet him, and Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo the moment he saw him.

(2 Kings 23:30) 
His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.

(2 Kings 23:31) 
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.

(2 Kings 23:32) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.

(2 Kings 23:33) 
Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so that he could not reign in Jerusalem. And Pharaoh imposed a tax on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.

(2 Kings 23:34) 
Pharaoh Necho then made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king in place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Pharaoh took him and brought him to Egypt, where he died.

(2 Kings 23:35) 
Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, after he had heavily taxed the land to pay the money according to Pharaoh's command. He exacted the silver and gold from each person according to their means, taking it from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Necho.

(2 Kings 23:36) 
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah, daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.

(2 Kings 23:37) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.

(2 Kings 23:38) 
In Jehoiakim’s days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him again.

(2 Kings 23:39) 
And the Lord sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, raiding bands of Syrians, raiding bands of Moabites, and raiding bands of the Ammonites. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken through His servants, the prophets.

(2 Kings 23:40) 
Indeed, this came to pass in Judah according to the word of the Lord, so that He might remove them from His presence because of all the sins of Manasseh that he had committed.

(2 Kings 23:1) 
So the king sent out messengers and gathered to himself all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 23:2) 
And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord. All the men of Judah, everyone found in Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people—from the least to the greatest—went with him. Then the king read, while everyone listened, all the words of the covenant book that had been found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:3) 
The king stood on his royal platform and made a solemn covenant before the Lord: that they would walk after the Lord and keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all their heart and all their soul. They also promised to confirm the words of this covenant, which were written in this book. And all the people agreed to this covenant.

(2 Kings 23:4) 
Then the king commanded Hilkiah, the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of the sky. He burned these items outside Jerusalem, in the Kidron Valley, and carried their ashes to Bethel.

(2 Kings 23:5) 
He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense at the high places throughout the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem. He also removed those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, and to all the host of the sky.

(2 Kings 23:6) 
He had the Asherah poles brought out from the Temple of the Lord, outside Jerusalem into the Kidron Valley. There he burned them, ground them to powder, and scattered the powder over the graves of the common people.

(2 Kings 23:7) 
He also tore down the living quarters of the male prostitutes, those who served false gods, which were in the Temple of the Lord, where women wove garments, like small shelters for idols.

(2 Kings 23:8) 
He gathered all the priests from the cities of Judah. He desecrated the high places where the priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beer-sheba. He also tore down the altars at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.

(2 Kings 23:9) 
However, the priests of the high places were not permitted to ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. Instead, they ate unleavened bread among their fellow priests.

(2 Kings 23:10) 
He also desecrated Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, so that no one could consecrate his son or his daughter by passing them through fire to Moloch.

(2 Kings 23:11) 
He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, at the entrance to the Temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the courtyards. And the chariots of the sun god he burned with fire.

(2 Kings 23:12) 
The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord—these the king destroyed. He quickly ran and broke them down from that place and brought their ashes to the Kidron torrent.

(2 Kings 23:13) 
The high places that were in Jerusalem, on the right side of the Mount of Offense, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites, and for Milcom (Moloch), the idol of the Ammonites—these the king desecrated.

(2 Kings 23:14) 
He broke the sacred pillars into pieces and cut down the Asherah poles. Then he filled their places with the bones of the dead.

(2 Kings 23:15) 
Furthermore, the altar that was in Bethel, and the high place that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had made—he who caused Israel to sin—both that altar and that high place Josiah destroyed. He burned it, crushed it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole as well.

(2 Kings 23:16) 
Then Josiah turned and saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. He sent men, took the bones from the tombs, and burned them on the altar, thereby desecrating it, just as the word of the Lord had declared through the man of God who had proclaimed these words long ago.

(2 Kings 23:17) 
And he asked, 'What is that monument I see there?' The men of the city replied to him, 'It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and announced these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'

(2 Kings 23:18) 
Josiah said, 'Leave him alone. Let no one disturb his bones.' So his bones remained untouched, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.

(2 Kings 23:19) 
Moreover, all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah removed. He did to them exactly as he had done in Bethel.

(2 Kings 23:20) 
He sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars, and he burned human bones upon them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 23:21) 
The king commanded all the people, saying, 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this covenant book.'

(2 Kings 23:22) 
For such a Passover had not been celebrated since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah.

(2 Kings 23:23) 
But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem with great devotion.

(2 Kings 23:24) 
Furthermore, Josiah abolished the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations that were found in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to uphold the words of the law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:25) 
There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses. Nor did any like him arise after him.

(2 Kings 23:26) 
Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger burned against Judah because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked Him.

(2 Kings 23:27) 
And the Lord said, 'I will also remove Judah from my presence, just as I removed Israel. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house about which I said, 'My Name shall be there.''

(2 Kings 23:28) 
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 23:29) 
In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up to attack the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to meet him in battle, and when Josiah saw him, he was killed at Megiddo.

(2 Kings 23:30) 
His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.

(2 Kings 23:31) 
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.

(2 Kings 23:32) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.

(2 Kings 23:33) 
Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, so that he could not reign in Jerusalem. He also imposed a fine on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.

(2 Kings 23:34) 
Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king in place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Pharaoh took him away to Egypt, and he died there.

(2 Kings 23:35) 
Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh after he had levied the amount from each person according to their means. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Neco.

(2 Kings 23:36) 
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah, daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.

(2 Kings 23:37) 
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.

(2 Kings 23:38) 
In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. Then he rebelled against him again.

(2 Kings 23:39) 
The Lord sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites' sons. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servants the prophets.

(2 Kings 23:40) 
For indeed, this happened in Judah according to the word of the Lord, that He might remove them from His presence because of all the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done.

(2 Kings 23:1) 
So King Josiah sent out orders, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.

(2 Kings 23:2) 
The king then went up to the Temple of the Lord, God’s holy dwelling, and with him were all the men of Judah, and everyone who was found in Jerusalem—the priests, the prophets, and all the people, from the youngest to the oldest. He read aloud for all to hear all the words of the book of the covenant, the rediscovered ancient law of God, which had been found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:3) 
The king stood by the pillar and made a solemn covenant before the Lord, promising that he and his people would walk after the Lord, and would keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His sacred rites with all their heart and with all their soul. They vowed to confirm all the words of this covenant which were written in this book. And all the people confirmed their agreement to the covenant.

(2 Kings 23:4) 
The king then commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second rank who assisted him, and the Temple doorkeepers, to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the items that had been made for the worship of Baal, and for the goddess Asherah, and for the worship of all the celestial bodies—the host of heaven. Josiah had these items burned outside Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley, a place of defilement, and had their ashes carried to Bethel, a site historically associated with Israelite idolatry.

(2 Kings 23:5) 
He then removed the pagan priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places, in the cities of Judah, and in the areas around Jerusalem. These priests had burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, and to all the celestial bodies—the host of heaven.

(2 Kings 23:6) 
He brought the Asherah pole, an idolatrous cult object, out from the Temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley in Jerusalem. There he burned it, ground it into dust, and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people, further defiling it.

(2 Kings 23:7) 
He also tore down the living quarters of the male cult prostitutes, which were located within the Temple of the Lord, where women wove hangings for the Asherah.

(2 Kings 23:8) 
Josiah then brought all the priests from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. He defiled the high places where these priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba in the north all the way to Beersheba in the south. He also demolished the altars at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.

(2 Kings 23:9) 
However, those priests who had served at the high places were not permitted to ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem; instead, they were only allowed to eat unleavened bread among their fellow priests, but not participate in the sacred Temple rituals.

(2 Kings 23:10) 
He also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to prevent anyone from consecrating their son or daughter by passing them through fire as a sacrifice to the pagan god Moloch. This practice of child sacrifice was abolished.

(2 Kings 23:11) 
He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, which were at the entrance of the Temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the sacred courtyard. He also burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

(2 Kings 23:12) 
The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had built, and the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord, these the king tore down. He quickly broke them into pieces and scattered their dust into the Kidron Valley.

(2 Kings 23:13) 
King Josiah also defiled the high places that were opposite Jerusalem, to the right of the Mount of Offence—also known as the Mount of Olives. These had been built by Solomon, the king of Israel, for Ashtoreth, the detestable idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the detestable idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites. Josiah rendered these sites unusable for worship.

(2 Kings 23:14) 
He smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with the bones of the dead, further desecrating these pagan sites.

(2 Kings 23:15) 
Furthermore, Josiah destroyed the altar at Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made, the very one who led Israel into sin. He pulled down that altar and the high place, burned them, crushed them to dust, and also burned the Asherah pole.

(2 Kings 23:16) 
As Josiah turned around, he saw the tombs that were on the mountain nearby. He sent and took the bones from those tombs, then burned them on the altar, thus defiling it. This action fulfilled the word of the Lord that had been spoken by the man of God, the prophet who had foretold these very events.

(2 Kings 23:17) 
And Josiah asked: 'What is that monument I see there?' The people of the city answered him: 'It is the tomb of the man of God, a prophet who came from Judah and foretold these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'

(2 Kings 23:18) 
So Josiah said: 'Leave him be; let no one disturb his bones.' Thus, his bones were left undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.

(2 Kings 23:19) 
Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had built to provoke the Lord to anger. He dealt with them in the same manner as all the things he had done in Bethel, thoroughly destroying them.

(2 Kings 23:20) 
He sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, offering them on their own altars. He also burned human bones on those altars, further desecrating them. After these purifications, Josiah returned to Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 23:21) 
Then King Josiah commanded all the people, saying: 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, exactly as it is written in this book of the covenant.'

(2 Kings 23:22) 
Indeed, such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days when the judges ruled Israel, nor during all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.

(2 Kings 23:23) 
It was in the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s reign that this Passover was celebrated for the Lord in Jerusalem, a celebration of unparalleled devotion.

(2 Kings 23:24) 
Moreover, Josiah removed all the mediums who consulted the dead, the spiritists, the household idols known as teraphim, the detestable false gods, and all the other abominations that had been present in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to establish the words of the Law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord.

(2 Kings 23:25) 
No king before him had turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses. Nor did any like him arise after him. Josiah’s devotion was truly exceptional.

(2 Kings 23:26) 
Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the great fierceness of His burning anger, with which His wrath had been kindled against Judah because of all the provocations that Manasseh, a former king, had caused.

(2 Kings 23:27) 
So the Lord said: 'I will also remove Judah from My presence, just as I removed Israel, the northern kingdom. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the Temple, about which I said: My Name shall be there.' This signified a complete rejection due to the people's persistent sin.

(2 Kings 23:28) 
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 23:29) 
In those days, Pharaoh Necho, the king of Egypt, went up to attack the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to confront him, and was killed at Megiddo as soon as he saw him in battle.

(2 Kings 23:30) 
His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah’s son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.

(2 Kings 23:31) 
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.

(2 Kings 23:32) 
He did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his predecessors, his fathers, had done.

(2 Kings 23:33) 
Then Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, to prevent him from reigning in Jerusalem. The Pharaoh also imposed a tribute on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.

(2 Kings 23:34) 
Pharaoh Necho then made Eliakim, Josiah’s son, king in place of his father Josiah, and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Necho took him away to Egypt, and he died there.

(2 Kings 23:35) 
Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh the silver and gold he demanded, collecting it by imposing a tax on each person according to their means. He exacted the money from the people of the land and gave it to Pharaoh Necho.

(2 Kings 23:36) 
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.

(2 Kings 23:37) 
He did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his predecessors, his fathers, had done.

(2 Kings 23:38) 
In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem. Jehoiakim became his servant for three years, but then he rebelled against him.

(2 Kings 23:39) 
And the Lord sent against him raiding parties of the Chaldeans, and raiding parties of the Syrians, and raiding parties of the Moabites, and raiding parties of the Ammonites. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servants the prophets.

(2 Kings 23:40) 
Indeed, this came upon Judah by the anger of the Lord, so that He might remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done.

(2 Kings 24:1) 
In those days, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched on Judah, and Jehoiakim, king of Judah, became his vassal for three years, but then Jehoiakim rebelled against him.

(2 Kings 24:2) 
And the Lord God sent against Jehoiakim raiding parties of Chaldeans, and raiding parties of Syrians, and raiding parties of Moabites, and raiding parties of the Ammonites. He sent them into Judah to destroy it, just as the Lord God had declared through His servants, the prophets.

(2 Kings 24:3) 
This happened in Judah precisely as the Lord God had declared: He removed them from His sight because of all the sins of Manasseh, everything that Manasseh had done,

(2 Kings 24:4) 
and because of the innocent blood that Manasseh had shed, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood. Because of this, the Lord God refused to forgive them.

(2 Kings 24:5) 
All the other deeds of Jehoiakim, and everything he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

(2 Kings 24:6) 
Jehoiakim died and was buried with his ancestors. Then his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.

(2 Kings 24:7) 
And the king of Egypt never again left his own territory, because the king of Babylon had taken all the lands that once belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Brook of Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River.

(2 Kings 24:8) 
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 24:9) 
And Jehoiachin did evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as his father had done.

(2 Kings 24:10) 
At that time, the army of the king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city was put under siege.

(2 Kings 24:11) 
King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon himself came to the city while his servants were besieging it.

(2 Kings 24:12) 
So Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, surrendered to the king of Babylon—he, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his eunuchs all surrendered. The king of Babylon accepted his surrender in the eighth year of his own reign.

(2 Kings 24:13) 
Nebuchadnezzar carried away all the treasures from the House of the Lord God and all the treasures from the king's palace. He also cut into pieces all the golden vessels that King Solomon of Israel had made for the Temple of the Lord God, just as the Lord God had declared.

(2 Kings 24:14) 
He deported all of Jerusalem's inhabitants, all the leaders, and all the mighty warriors—ten thousand of them into captivity. He also took every craftsman and every blacksmith, leaving behind only the poorest people of the land.

(2 Kings 24:15) 
Nebuchadnezzar also deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with the king's mother, the king's wives, his eunuchs, and all the powerful men of the land were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.

(2 Kings 24:16) 
And all the strong men, numbering seven thousand, and a thousand craftsmen and blacksmiths—all of them strong and capable warriors—the king of Babylon brought them as captives to Babylon.

(2 Kings 24:17) 
And the king of Babylon then made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place, changing his name to Zedekiah.

(2 Kings 24:18) 
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.

(2 Kings 24:19) 
And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as Jehoiakim had done.

(2 Kings 24:20) 
For the Lord God was so angry with Jerusalem and with Judah that He eventually cast them out from His sight. Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.

(2 Kings 25:1) 
It happened in the ninth year of King Sedecias’ reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem with his entire army. They surrounded the city and built siege works all around it.

(2 Kings 25:2) 
The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of King Sedecias’ reign.

(2 Kings 25:3) 
On the ninth day of that month, a severe famine gripped the city, and the people of the land had no bread left to eat.

(2 Kings 25:4) 
The city’s defenses were breached, and all the fighting men fled by night through the gate between the two walls that led to the king’s garden. The Chaldeans were surrounding the city at this point. The king himself escaped by way of the plain.

(2 Kings 25:5) 
The Chaldean army pursued the king and captured him in the desert plains near Jericho. All the soldiers who had been with him were scattered away from him.

(2 Kings 25:6) 
So, the captured king was brought to the king of Babylon in Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath. There, Nebuchadnezzar pronounced judgment against him.

(2 Kings 25:7) 
Nebuchadnezzar then killed Sedecias’ sons right before his eyes. After that, he gouged out Sedecias’ eyes, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon.

(2 Kings 25:8) 
In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon—Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard and a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

(2 Kings 25:9) 
He set fire to the Temple of the Lord, the king’s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building was burned down.

(2 Kings 25:10) 
The entire Chaldean army, who were with the commander of the royal guard, tore down the walls of Jerusalem all around the city.

(2 Kings 25:11) 
Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard, carried away into exile the rest of the people who had remained in the city, along with those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and all the other common people.

(2 Kings 25:12) 
However, the commander of the royal guard left behind some of the poorest people of the land to be vine dressers and farmers.

(2 Kings 25:13) 
The Chaldeans also broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the Temple of the Lord, as well as the movable stands and the great bronze basin known as the Sea, which was also in the Lord's Temple. They carried all the bronze from these items away to Babylon.

(2 Kings 25:14) 
They also took away the bronze pots, shovels, snuffers, ladles, and all the other bronze vessels used in the Temple service.

(2 Kings 25:15) 
The commander of the royal guard also took away the fire pans and the sprinkling bowls, distinguishing those made of solid gold and those made of solid silver.

(2 Kings 25:16) 
As for the two pillars, the one great Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the Temple of the Lord, the amount of bronze in all these vessels was immeasurable.

(2 Kings 25:17) 
Each pillar was eighteen cubits high, with a bronze capital three cubits high on top. Over the capital, there was bronze lattice work and pomegranates, all made of bronze. The second pillar was identical to this one.

(2 Kings 25:18) 
The commander of the royal guard also took away Saraias, the chief priest, Sophonias, the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

(2 Kings 25:19) 
From the city, he took one eunuch who was in charge of the fighting men; five men who served as the king's close advisors, whom he found in the city; Sopher, the commander of the army; and sixty men from the common people of the land, who were also found in the city.

(2 Kings 25:20) 
Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard, took all these men and brought them to the king of Babylon in Riblah.

(2 Kings 25:21) 
There, in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So, Judah was carried away from its own land into exile.

(2 Kings 25:22) 
As for the people who had been left behind in the land of Judah, those whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had permitted to remain, he appointed Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, over them.

(2 Kings 25:23) 
When all the army commanders—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias as governor, they came to Godolias in Maspha. These were Ismael, son of Nathanias; Joanan, son of Caree; Sarea, son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite; and Jezonias, son of Maachati, along with their companions.

(2 Kings 25:24) 
Godolias swore an oath to them and their companions, saying: 'Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.'

(2 Kings 25:25) 
However, in the seventh month, Ismael, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, who was of royal lineage, came with ten men. They struck down Godolias, who died, and also killed the Jews and Chaldeans who were with him in Maspha.

(2 Kings 25:26) 
Then all the people, from the least to the greatest, along with the army commanders, were afraid. So they rose up and went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldeans’ retaliation.

(2 Kings 25:27) 
It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Joachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month. Evilmerodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, released Joachin, the king of Judah, from prison.

(2 Kings 25:28) 
Evilmerodach spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.

(2 Kings 25:29) 
Joachin was allowed to change out of his prison clothes, and he was given food to eat continually in the king’s presence for the rest of his life.

(2 Kings 25:30) 
The king also provided him with a regular daily allowance of food for the remaining days of his life, until his death.
