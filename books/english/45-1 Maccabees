(1 Maccabees 1:1) 
After Alexander of Macedon, son of Philip, the first to reign over Greece, defeated many kings and then left the land of Kittim,

(1 Maccabees 1:2) 
he fought many wars against King Darius of Persia and Media,

(1 Maccabees 1:3) 
and he conquered fortresses and killed the kings of the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:4) 
He went to the ends of the earth, seizing plunder from many nations, and the earth was quiet before him.

(1 Maccabees 1:5) 
Alexander became arrogant, and his heart was lifted up.

(1 Maccabees 1:6) 
He gathered a very strong army and ruled over the region, the nations, and the kings.

(1 Maccabees 1:7) 
He died, and he realized that he was about to die.

(1 Maccabees 1:8) 
He called his servants, who were noble and had been raised with him since his youth, and he divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.

(1 Maccabees 1:9) 
Alexander reigned for twelve years, and then he died.

(1 Maccabees 1:10) 
His servants divided his kingdom, taking power, and they all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years: and evil increased in the land.

(1 Maccabees 1:11) 
Then came forth a sinful root, Antiochus, called Epiphanes, son of King Antiochus, who had been a hostage in Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

(1 Maccabees 1:12) 
In those days, some wicked men of Israel went out and persuaded many, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles around us. For since we separated ourselves from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 1:13) 
This speech pleased them.

(1 Maccabees 1:14) 
They sent word to King Antiochus, and he gave them authority to follow the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 1:15) 
They built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the nations,

(1 Maccabees 1:16) 
and they made themselves uncircumcised, and they abandoned the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the Gentiles, and were sold to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 1:17) 
The kingdom of Antiochus was prepared, and he gathered a very strong army, and entered into the land of Egypt, to reign over it.

(1 Maccabees 1:18) 
He came into Egypt with a multitude, with chariots, elephants, horsemen, and many ships,

(1 Maccabees 1:19) 
and he made war against Ptolemy, the king of Egypt: and Ptolemy was afraid before him, and fled.

(1 Maccabees 1:20) 
He seized the fortified cities in the land of Egypt and plundered the land of Egypt.

(1 Maccabees 1:21) 
Antiochus struck Egypt in the one hundred and forty-third year, and then he went up to Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:22) 
He went up to Jerusalem with a strong army.

(1 Maccabees 1:23) 
He entered the sanctuary with arrogance, and took the golden altar, and the lampstand of light, and all its vessels.

(1 Maccabees 1:24) 
He took the table of the bread of the Presence, the vessels for libations, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the golden ornament that was on the facade of the temple: and he plundered it all.

(1 Maccabees 1:25) 
He took silver, gold, and the precious vessels; and he found the hidden treasure.

(1 Maccabees 1:26) 
Taking it all, he went back to his own land, where he committed slaughter, and spoke great wickedness.

(1 Maccabees 1:27) 
There was great mourning in Israel and in all their places.

(1 Maccabees 1:28) 
The leaders and the elders groaned, the young men and maidens languished, and the beauty of the women was changed.

(1 Maccabees 1:29) 
Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and the bride was, as it were, in mourning.

(1 Maccabees 1:30) 
The earth shook over its inhabitants, and the whole house of Jacob was covered with confusion.

(1 Maccabees 1:31) 
After two years, the king sent the chief tax collector into the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude.

(1 Maccabees 1:32) 
He spoke to them with deceitful words of peace, and they believed him: and he suddenly attacked the city, and struck it with a great plague, and destroyed many people of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:33) 
He plundered the city, and burned it with fire, and demolished its houses, and its walls around it.

(1 Maccabees 1:34) 
He took captive the women and children, and possessed the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 1:35) 
They built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and strong towers, and it became a citadel for them:

(1 Maccabees 1:36) 
and they placed there a sinful people, wicked men, and they strengthened themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 1:37) 
They put treasure in it, and made a secret place, and they became a trap for the people of Israel always, and those who lay in wait for the sanctuary.

(1 Maccabees 1:38) 
They shed innocent blood around the sanctuary and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:39) 
The inhabitants feared them, and the dwelling became the dwelling of the Gentiles, and it became foreign to the people, and they were driven out, and withdrew from their sons.

(1 Maccabees 1:40) 
They took away the glory of the temple, and took away its vessels, and they burned its holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:41) 
They gave the cities of Judah to destruction.

(1 Maccabees 1:42) 
And they came to Jerusalem, and strangers lived there, and they drove out the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 1:43) 
They defiled the holy things, and put idols in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 1:44) 
And they sent word around to all parts of Judah, and brought out those who were not wicked, and gathered an army.

(1 Maccabees 1:45) 
And they came to the city, and took it, and defiled the holy place.

(1 Maccabees 1:46) 
And they did evil around the sanctuary, and the Gentiles did too.

(1 Maccabees 1:47) 
And all the nations agreed, and gave him power.

(1 Maccabees 1:48) 
And they did in Jerusalem according to the customs of the Gentiles, according to idols, and they did not cause danger.

(1 Maccabees 1:49) 
And they placed idols in the temple, and burned the temple with fire.

(1 Maccabees 1:50) 
They shed the blood of the just, and turned their prayers into blood.

(1 Maccabees 1:51) 
And all the people who were around, helped them.

(1 Maccabees 1:52) 
And the king commanded his whole land, that all should be one people, and that everyone should abandon their own law.

(1 Maccabees 1:53) 
And all the Gentiles agreed according to the king's word.

(1 Maccabees 1:54) 
And many of Israel submitted to his servitude, and sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 1:55) 
And the king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah, that they should follow the laws of the Gentiles of the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:56) 
and that they should forbid the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and libations in the sanctification of the temple,

(1 Maccabees 1:57) 
and that they should profane the sabbaths and solemnities,

(1 Maccabees 1:58) 
and contaminate the holy things and the holy days.

(1 Maccabees 1:59) 
And that they should build altars, shrines, and idols, and sacrifice pigs and unclean animals,

(1 Maccabees 1:60) 
and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, and defile their souls in all things unclean and abominable,

(1 Maccabees 1:61) 
that they should put their souls in all worship of idols, and forget the holy name.

(1 Maccabees 1:62) 
And whoever does not act according to the king's word, shall die.

(1 Maccabees 1:63) 
He wrote all these things in his whole land, and appointed officials over all the people, and commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 1:64) 
Then many of the people, who had forsaken the law of the Lord, went over to them, and did evil in the land,

(1 Maccabees 1:65) 
and led Israel into hiding.

(1 Maccabees 2:1) 
Some time later, Mattathias, son of John, son of Simon, a priest from the family of Joarib, left Jerusalem upon hearing that many from Judah and Jerusalem were turning away from God.

(1 Maccabees 2:2) 
The Jews were committing wicked acts in the land of Israel, and had shown great disrespect in Jerusalem, following the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:3) 
Mattathias and his sons said: “Woe to us! Why have we been born? What has happened to us?

(1 Maccabees 2:4) 
The sacred vessels were taken and scattered, our sons are lost, and the sons of Zion have been murdered by our enemies.

(1 Maccabees 2:5) 
Glory has been taken from us, and the kingdom and the sanctity of God are overthrown; we are now like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:6) 
Why then do we delay?

(1 Maccabees 2:7) 
So all of the people gathered around them.

(1 Maccabees 2:8) 
They gathered in a place called Mizpah, near Jerusalem, because it was a place of prayer in Israel.

(1 Maccabees 2:9) 
Jonathan, son of Mattathias, and his sons said to their brothers: “Now our enemies are united, and the Gentiles have turned against us.

(1 Maccabees 2:10) 
Come, let us strengthen our people, and fight for our people and for our holy things.”

(1 Maccabees 2:11) 
So the whole army was gathered, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 2:12) 
Then Mattathias said: “Listen, you who are zealous for the law, so that you may do justice and righteousness in your days.

(1 Maccabees 2:13) 
Follow me.

(1 Maccabees 2:14) 
Our brothers are dead, scattered throughout the land, because of the wicked deeds of the evildoers: and we are like the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:15) 
So gather yourselves, and let us fight for our lives.”

(1 Maccabees 2:16) 
Then the whole army gathered on that day, and they held a meeting on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:17) 
They said to them: “Why is it that you all left, and are sitting still?

(1 Maccabees 2:18) 
The men of the Gentiles said: “Let us go and do as the king has commanded, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 2:19) 
They replied to them: “We will not do it, nor will we obey the king’s command, nor will we depart from our religion, nor from any part of our works.”

(1 Maccabees 2:20) 
Then they stopped fighting.

(1 Maccabees 2:21) 
Many Israelites agreed with the wicked deeds, and they sacrificed to idols, and profaned the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:22) 
Then Mattathias and his sons said: “If we all do as our brothers did, and do not fight for our lives, for our righteousness, and for our holy things,

(1 Maccabees 2:23) 
everyone will kill us on the Sabbaths.”

(1 Maccabees 2:24) 
So they gathered against them: and fought with them: and killed them on the Sabbath.

(1 Maccabees 2:25) 
While they were pursuing them on the Sabbaths, they came upon them with great force.

(1 Maccabees 2:26) 
They killed them on that day, and with the wicked, and did not count them.

(1 Maccabees 2:27) 
Mattathias and his friends dressed, and they ran throughout the entire city, and destroyed the altars of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 2:28) 
They circumcised the boys who were found uncircumcised in the borders of Israel, according to the law.

(1 Maccabees 2:29) 
And they pursued the sons of the proud, and the work prospered in their hands.

(1 Maccabees 2:30) 
They gained the law from the hand of the Gentiles, and from the hand of the kings, and they did not give a place to sinners.

(1 Maccabees 2:31) 
The day of Mattathias’s death approached: and he said to his sons: “Now pride, punishment, the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation are established.

(1 Maccabees 2:32) 
Now therefore, sons, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.

(1 Maccabees 2:33) 
And he responded, saying: “Behold, Simon your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel: always listen to him, and he will be a father to you.”

(1 Maccabees 2:34) 
And Judas Maccabaeus, strong from his youth, will be the leader of the army for you, and he will wage war against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 2:35) 
And bring to yourselves all those who keep the law, and take vengeance on your people.

(1 Maccabees 2:36) 
Repay the Gentiles their retribution, and pay attention to the commandments of the law.”

(1 Maccabees 2:37) 
Then Mattathias died: and his sons buried him in the tombs of their fathers in Modein, and all Israel mourned for him with great mourning.

(1 Maccabees 3:1) 
In those days, Antiochus, the son of King Antiochus, departed from Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year.

(1 Maccabees 3:2) 
In those days, the sons of iniquity went out from Israel and persuaded many people, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles who are around us. Because since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.”

(1 Maccabees 3:3) 
And this word seemed good in their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 3:4) 
And they appointed some of the people and sent them to the king, and the king gave them authority to do according to the customs of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:5) 
And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, following the laws of the nations:

(1 Maccabees 3:6) 
they circumcised themselves, abandoned the holy covenant, allied themselves with the Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.

(1 Maccabees 3:7) 
And as the kingdom grew stronger, Antiochus sent to Jerusalem, to the city, to crush it.

(1 Maccabees 3:8) 
And he entered it with a great multitude, took the city, and inflicted a great slaughter in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:9) 
And he commanded his angels to do it, and they went out and struck the men in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:10) 
And they shed the blood of the just and defiled the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:11) 
And they seized the spoils of the city, burned it with fire, and destroyed its houses and walls all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:12) 
And they took women and children captive and took possession of the livestock.

(1 Maccabees 3:13) 
And they built a wall around the city of David, great and strong, and strong towers, and it became a fortress for them.

(1 Maccabees 3:14) 
And they placed a sinful people and wicked men there, and they fortified themselves in it.

(1 Maccabees 3:15) 
And they imposed an unjust temple, and every nation that was there, with evil works.

(1 Maccabees 3:16) 
And they took away the continual sacrifice and the sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 3:17) 
And they set up the abomination of desolation in the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:18) 
And they built altars in the cities of Judah all around.

(1 Maccabees 3:19) 
And they sacrificed at the gates of houses and in the streets.

(1 Maccabees 3:20) 
And they burned the books of the law with fire, which they had found.

(1 Maccabees 3:21) 
And they killed anyone they found possessing the testament and observing the law, by the king's command.

(1 Maccabees 3:22) 
And they acted with their might in Jerusalem, and in the months, and in the days.

(1 Maccabees 3:23) 
And they sent to Beria with great violence, to fill Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:24) 
And on the twenty-fifth day of the month, they sacrificed on the altar of idols, which was above the altar of the temple.

(1 Maccabees 3:25) 
And they killed the women who had circumcised their sons, according to the command, and they hanged their sons by the neck.

(1 Maccabees 3:26) 
And many of Israel resolved within themselves and determined not to eat anything unclean.

(1 Maccabees 3:27) 
And they chose death rather than be defiled and not pollute the holy covenant; and they died.

(1 Maccabees 3:28) 
And great wrath came upon Israel.

(1 Maccabees 3:29) 
In those days, Mattathias, the son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, arose and settled in the city of Modin.

(1 Maccabees 3:30) 
And he had five sons: John, and Simon, who was called Thassi, and Judas, who was called Maccabaeus.

(1 Maccabees 3:31) 
And Eleazar, and Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 3:32) 
And he saw the zeal and iniquities that were happening in Judah and Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 3:33) 
And he said: “Woe is me! Why was I born to see this? I am grieved by the destruction of my people, and I am grieved by the destruction of the holy place, and I have been delivered into the hands of foreigners.”

(1 Maccabees 3:34) 
And he gathered all of his belongings, and they went out into the desert, where they left their sons and their wives.

(1 Maccabees 3:35) 
And they went out with their sons and fought in the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:36) 
And Antiochus the king sent troops to force those who were left to come down and transgress.

(1 Maccabees 3:37) 
And they said to Mattathias: “You are the son of a prince, and you are great and noble in this city, and here is a gathering, and the Gentiles who are around are at your service.

(1 Maccabees 3:38) 
Come, therefore, first, and do the king’s command, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah have done, and those who remained in Jerusalem. And you and your sons will be in the number of the king's friends, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”

(1 Maccabees 3:39) 
And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice: “Even if all the Gentiles who are in the king’s kingdom have listened to him and have departed from the worship of their fathers and have chosen his desires.

(1 Maccabees 3:40) 
I and my sons and my brothers will walk in the covenant of our fathers.

(1 Maccabees 3:41) 
May it be far from us that we should forsake the law and its judgments.

(1 Maccabees 3:42) 
We will not obey the words of the king, nor will we transgress our worship, neither to the right nor to the left.”

(1 Maccabees 3:43) 
And when he had finished speaking these words, a certain Jew approached in the sight of all, to sacrifice to idols in the city of Modin, according to the king’s command.

(1 Maccabees 3:44) 
And Mattathias saw this, and he was inflamed with zeal, and his loins trembled, and he was moved to indignation according to judgment, and he rushed forward and struck him on the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:45) 
And also the man who was carrying out the king's command, he struck in the same hour, and they destroyed the altar.

(1 Maccabees 3:46) 
And they were zealous for the law, as Phinehas did with Zambri the son of Salomi.

(1 Maccabees 3:47) 
And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: “Whoever has zeal for the law and keeps the statutes, let him come out after me.”

(1 Maccabees 3:48) 
And he and his sons fled into the mountains and left all that they had in the city.

(1 Maccabees 3:49) 
Then many went down, seeking judgment and justice, to go into the desert.

(1 Maccabees 3:50) 
And they lived there, they and their sons and their wives and their livestock because evils had abounded upon them.

(1 Maccabees 3:51) 
And this word was announced to King Antiochus, and he was angry, and he gathered all his army and said: “I know that the Jews have departed from me and do not do what I want, but they have been led by me into their laws.”

(1 Maccabees 3:52) 
And he sent an army to them, with a multitude, to destroy them.

(1 Maccabees 3:53) 
And the army went out against them and approached them and encamped against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:54) 
And they said to them: “Now we will do to you: Go out and do according to the word of the king, and you will live.”

(1 Maccabees 3:55) 
They said: “We will not go out, nor will we do the word of the king, nor will we transgress the Sabbath day.”

(1 Maccabees 3:56) 
And they gave them battle quickly.

(1 Maccabees 3:57) 
And they did not respond to them, nor did they throw a stone, nor did they obstruct their places, saying, “Let us all die in our innocence.”

(1 Maccabees 3:58) 
And they gathered against them on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 3:59) 
And they died, with their wives and their sons and their livestock, and they descended to a thousand souls.

(1 Maccabees 3:60) 
And Mattathias and his friends knew this and mourned them greatly.

(1 Maccabees 3:61) 
And they said, man to his neighbor: “If we all do as our brothers did and do not fight for our souls and our justifications, we will all be surrendered in a short time.

(1 Maccabees 3:62) 
And they resolved on that day, saying: “Whoever comes against us in battle on the Sabbath, we will fight against him, and we will not all die as our brothers died in secret places.”

(1 Maccabees 3:63) 
Then war was added to them from the side of the Asidaeans and the strong men of Israel, all who willingly offered themselves to the law.

(1 Maccabees 3:64) 
And all the Israelites who were fleeing from the evils added help to them and strengthened them.

(1 Maccabees 3:65) 
And the army gathered and struck the sinners in their anger and the wicked men in their indignation, and the rest fled to the Gentiles to preserve themselves.

(1 Maccabees 3:66) 
And Mattathias and his friends went around and destroyed the altars.

(1 Maccabees 3:67) 
And they circumcised the infant boys, whom they found in the borders of Israel, whoever they found.

(1 Maccabees 3:68) 
And they struck the sons of the arrogant.

(1 Maccabees 3:69) 
And they completed the work with their own hand, and they took vengeance in the hands of the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 3:70) 
And the days which they completed and gave for the law are glorious.

(1 Maccabees 4:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-eighth year, the kings left Syria and entered the land of Judah.

(1 Maccabees 4:2) 
And Judas selected men, and sent soldiers, and fought against them: and killed about three thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:3) 
And the army of the Jews gathered, and they came to Gophna: and went away.

(1 Maccabees 4:4) 
Then the enemies of the Jews gathered, and came together as one: and went out as though to ascend to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:5) 
And Judas heard, he went out with ten men with him.

(1 Maccabees 4:6) 
And they fought bravely, and struck down about thirty men of the army: and they returned.

(1 Maccabees 4:7) 
And their enemies saw that the Jews were attacking them, and went out of the fields, and withdrew to the road, where they were.

(1 Maccabees 4:8) 
And the Jews gathered and came to Bethsura: and fought against them throughout the day.

(1 Maccabees 4:9) 
And they rose up in the day, and gave their hands to their men, and were in the same place.

(1 Maccabees 4:10) 
And they went out of Bethsura, and came to the camps of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:11) 
And it happened on that day, that Achima, son of Calami, entered from the camps of the Tyrians.

(1 Maccabees 4:12) 
And in that place they killed Achima, and his brothers: and they were slain.

(1 Maccabees 4:13) 
And Judas and his army gathered, and ascended to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:14) 
And he placed a garrison there, and commanded them to guard it.

(1 Maccabees 4:15) 
And Judas took and chose men, and sent them to Joppa, a city by the sea, to cast out those who were there of his people.

(1 Maccabees 4:16) 
And coming, he took the port, and killed those who were there: and left the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:17) 
And knowing that Judas was approaching, they feared: and they shut the gates, and were afraid.

(1 Maccabees 4:18) 
And Judas sent, and they seized them.

(1 Maccabees 4:19) 
And he crushed them with the sword, those who were in the city.

(1 Maccabees 4:20) 
And he took Joppa, and all the ports of Judea, and from the tribes, and came to Gaza.

(1 Maccabees 4:21) 
And those who were in Gaza came and shut themselves in.

(1 Maccabees 4:22) 
And Judas besieged it, and gave them plunder, and burned its walls.

(1 Maccabees 4:23) 
And they took a great amount of plunder from Gaza, and from its borders, and from all its villages that were in the surrounding area.

(1 Maccabees 4:24) 
And Judas took his army, and came to Ascalon: and there, in the fields, he adored their idols.

(1 Maccabees 4:25) 
And he turned away, and led his army away, and shouting, they returned to Judea with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:26) 
And they ascended Mount Zion with great joy and gladness: and they offered burnt offerings, because they had not perished from their enemies.

(1 Maccabees 4:27) 
And they celebrated the purification of the temple for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with joy, and sacrifice for sin.

(1 Maccabees 4:28) 
And they adorned the temple, and the courts, and sanctified the court.

(1 Maccabees 4:29) 
And they made lights on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is Chasalew.

(1 Maccabees 4:30) 
And they established by decree, to all the people of the Jews, that they should celebrate these days, every year.

(1 Maccabees 4:31) 
And in that time, Antiochus Epiphanes rose up and went to the land of the Persians.

(1 Maccabees 4:32) 
And he gathered an army, and fought against the Persians: and he was conquered.

(1 Maccabees 4:33) 
And entering Persia, he heard that there was great commotion in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:34) 
And departing from Persia, he came.

(1 Maccabees 4:35) 
And he sent Philip, his friend, over the Jews: and he killed in Jerusalem: and took away the reward from them.

(1 Maccabees 4:36) 
And in this matter, he approached with haste, and passed through Samaria, in order to destroy the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 4:37) 
And when he had done this, he heard that Judas and his brothers were near, and had gathered an army, and were fighting bravely.

(1 Maccabees 4:38) 
And he said: "Now I will divide my army, and I will fight against them, and I will kill them."

(1 Maccabees 4:39) 
And he gathered his army, and rushed, and began on the road, on the ascent to Bethoron.

(1 Maccabees 4:40) 
And Judas sent, and went out with a few, to meet the army.

(1 Maccabees 4:41) 
And seeing the army coming, he said: "Because they are many, and we are few:

(1 Maccabees 4:42) 
Let us not fear them: let us fight for our souls."

(1 Maccabees 4:43) 
And when they began to fight, he approached from the place, and the army was routed.

(1 Maccabees 4:44) 
And those who were in his sight, fled on the road from Bethoron: and the Jews pursued them to the plains, and killed about eight thousand men of them.

(1 Maccabees 4:45) 
And from there, Judas and his brothers set out, and came to the plains, and came to Bethsura.

(1 Maccabees 4:46) 
And Antiochus heard, he went out with great power, to fight against the Jews: and he commanded that preparations be made.

(1 Maccabees 4:47) 
And when his army was prepared and complete, he ordered them to go into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 4:48) 
And coming, he pitched camp against Bethsura: and fought for many days: and made machines and works.

(1 Maccabees 4:49) 
And those who were from Bethsura went out and burned: and struck the machines.

(1 Maccabees 4:50) 
And they fought great battles.

(1 Maccabees 4:51) 
And Judas knew that they had come, and that they were fighting, and their hearts began to be troubled.

(1 Maccabees 4:52) 
And those with him appeared, to be a help to him.

(1 Maccabees 4:53) 
And he went out as though to the camps against Antiochus, and they fought battles: and about five thousand men fell from his army.

(1 Maccabees 4:54) 
And Antiochus and his army, seeing that they had fallen, returned to Judea with great sorrow.

(1 Maccabees 4:55) 
And Judas and his brothers took their dead: and they buried them in the sepulchers of their fathers.

(1 Maccabees 4:56) 
And they put their bones in the sepulchers of their fathers: and they celebrated the twenty-fifth day of the month of September, with joy and gladness.

(1 Maccabees 4:57) 
And they established these days, every year, with joy.

(1 Maccabees 4:58) 
And they built camps on Mount Zion, around the temple: and they lived with the people, with joy and gladness, and fearing God.

(1 Maccabees 5:1) 
In those days, Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers rose up, and fought against the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 5:2) 
He went into their territory and defeated a large population and gained strength.

(1 Maccabees 5:18) 
Many were wounded and killed.

(1 Maccabees 5:19) 
The Philistines gathered and came into the land of Judah and made an incursion.

(1 Maccabees 5:20) 
Judas and his brothers approached and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:21) 
They killed three thousand men among the Philistine people.

(1 Maccabees 5:22) 
Judas and his companions looked at those who had fallen and took their weapons.

(1 Maccabees 5:23) 
They pursued them as far as Gaza and the borders of Judah, and defeated them as far as Gaza and the borders of Azotus.

(1 Maccabees 5:24) 
They came to Askelon and into their land, for they had their idols, and they burned them with fire.

(1 Maccabees 5:25) 
On that day, those who were in the camp and those in the borders of Judea rose up unexpectedly to attack them.

(1 Maccabees 5:26) 
Judas went out and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:27) 
He defeated them, and killed about two thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:28) 
He returned to the camp with a great multitude of spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:29) 
In those days, those in the borders of Judea gathered and said to Simon, the brother of Judas,

(1 Maccabees 5:30) 
“Judas and his brothers have done great things, and war against the enemies and us.

(1 Maccabees 5:31) 
Send us, and we will fight for our brothers.

(1 Maccabees 5:32) 
Simon sent them to fight and they were chosen, and they went with him.

(1 Maccabees 5:33) 
They fought against them on that day and defeated them, and they fled before them.

(1 Maccabees 5:34) 
They pursued them in the field and killed about three thousand men and seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:35) 
They brought from Galilee and Arbatta, their wives and children, and all that they had, and came to the land of Judah with great joy.

(1 Maccabees 5:36) 
Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers went out and came to the borders of Idumea and fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 5:37) 
They defeated the strong among them and seized the camps and attacked those who were in the tower.

(1 Maccabees 5:38) 
They besieged them, and set up machines against them, and they stormed and burned the tower with fire, and all who were in it.

(1 Maccabees 5:39) 
They went against them in another place and killed about twenty thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 5:40) 
When they came to a tower, which was very fortified, they besieged it and fought against it bravely.

(1 Maccabees 5:41) 
Two thousand men fell from those who were in it, and they burned the rest with fire, and they seized their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 5:42) 
From there, they set out to fight against the Ammonites, and they found a strong people and a large population.

(1 Maccabees 5:43) 
They fought against them greatly, and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 5:44) 
They fled and Judas and those who were with him defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:45) 
They gave up their towns and returned to Judah.

(1 Maccabees 5:46) 
The Gentiles who were in Gilead gathered against Israel, who were in their borders.

(1 Maccabees 5:47) 
They fought against them and fled to their borders and came to the camps.

(1 Maccabees 5:48) 
Then the sons of foreigners came together to destroy them, and they took the road to attack Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:49) 
They went out from the camps and met them in battle and defeated them.

(1 Maccabees 5:50) 
Many of them were wounded and killed, and the rest fled to Sela.

(1 Maccabees 5:51)

(1 Maccabees 5:52)

(1 Maccabees 5:53) 
They came to Sela, and came to the camps, and they worshipped the great God there.

(1 Maccabees 5:54) 
Judas and his brothers went out and fought against the sons of Esau in their land to the south, and they defeated Charracam and the sons of Esau, and prevailed over them, and seized their spoils and their swords.

(1 Maccabees 5:55) 
They went to Bethsura, which was a fortified city, and was a place where the people dwelt.

(1 Maccabees 5:56) 
Hearing that they were attacking the city and fighting against it, they gathered together as one.

(1 Maccabees 5:57) 
They went out from Bethsura, and many were wounded and killed among them.

(1 Maccabees 5:58) 
Judas and his brothers went into the field, and behold, a great multitude of those who were with John and who were with him in the borders of Judea, had perished.

(1 Maccabees 5:59) 
Judas and his brothers grieved and said to their relatives:

(1 Maccabees 5:60) 
“Their people have perished, and here we are. Let us fight.”

(1 Maccabees 5:61) 
He gathered the entire army and put them in prayer, to ask for peace from God.

(1 Maccabees 5:62) 
They went out with them and fought and defeated them, and many were wounded.

(1 Maccabees 5:63) 
They buried their dead.

(1 Maccabees 5:64) 
They returned to the camp, and there was a great victory.

(1 Maccabees 5:65) 
They remained in Bethsura, praising the Most High.

(1 Maccabees 5:66) 
In those days, the land of Judea had peace.

(1 Maccabees 6:1) 
In the year 150, in the eighth month, at Antioch, the other armies surrounded him.

(1 Maccabees 6:2) 
They loved Philip before he returned, and it was agreed that he would be the prince of the kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 6:3) 
Therefore, he hurried, so that he would have a task and would be ready for war. And suddenly he appeared from the ships, and entered the city, and seized it.

(1 Maccabees 6:4) 
But when Demetrius heard this, he gathered his army and set out against him.

(1 Maccabees 6:5) 
And they fought together, and Philip was driven from the city and became stronger.

(1 Maccabees 6:6) 
And Demetrius greatly lamented, and then he knew that his ruin was near.

(1 Maccabees 6:7) 
And he went to a place and commanded his friends: “Kill the boy Antiochus.”

(1 Maccabees 6:8) 
And he gave the command, and he died that day.

(1 Maccabees 6:9) 
And Demetrius sent Nicanor, the leader of the cavalry, with a great army, and he fought against Judas.

(1 Maccabees 6:10) 
And they announced to the people of Judah: “Behold, Nicanor is coming.”

(1 Maccabees 6:11) 
Having heard this, they trembled and were afraid; and the army prayed with the people, and cried out, and said:

(1 Maccabees 6:12) 
“Holy One, who has chosen this house, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, have mercy upon it; and let the filthy deeds and blasphemies of Nicanor not prevail against you.”

(1 Maccabees 6:13) 
And they fought; and about five thousand five hundred fell from Nicanor's army, and the rest fled into the city of David.

(1 Maccabees 6:14) 
After this, however, Nicanor went up to Mount Zion: and the priests and the elders of the people came out, greeting him peacefully.

(1 Maccabees 6:15) 
And they said: “There is no need to speak of this matter with the king.”

(1 Maccabees 6:16) 
And Nicanor did not accept their words, and in anger he swore to them, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:17) 
“Unless you hand over to me Judas and his army immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn down this house.”

(1 Maccabees 6:18) 
And Nicanor went away furiously. And the priests entered, standing before the altar and the temple, and saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:19) 
“You chose this house for your sanctification, Lord, so that Your name may be invoked in it, that it may be for You a house of prayer and supplication for Your people.

(1 Maccabees 6:20) 
Avenge their iniquities, and take vengeance on them.”

(1 Maccabees 6:21) 
Now Nicanor departed from Jerusalem and placed his camp in Beth-Horon: and armies came out to meet him from Syria.

(1 Maccabees 6:22) 
And Judas sent against him. And they fought in the army of Nicanor; and about nine thousand of his army fell, and were wounded and weakened, and wounded in battle.

(1 Maccabees 6:23) 
And with this, they returned to their places. But Nicanor remained in the city of Jerusalem. And he was in the temple; and he killed everyone very unjustly.

(1 Maccabees 6:24) 
And Nicanor was angry, and said: “Unless they hand over to me Judas and his army, immediately, if I return in peace, I will burn the temple.”

(1 Maccabees 6:25) 
And Judas said: “If you hand him over to us, we will depart in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 6:26) 
And Nicanor departed, and the word was not fulfilled. And about this, Judas sent messengers to prepare for war.

(1 Maccabees 6:27) 
And they fought in Azotus; and about thirty-five thousand men fell from Nicanor's army: and Nicanor was defeated by the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 6:28) 
And the Jews fled from Azotus and pursued Nicanor as far as Gaza. And shouting after him, saying:

(1 Maccabees 6:29) 
“For there will not be for us those who are to be seized by us”. And they took the head of Nicanor and his hand, which he had stretched out, and they hung it near the tower, and made it known to all.

(1 Maccabees 6:30) 
And they established one day, so that they would celebrate this day, that is, the day of victory. And they prayed and entreated the Lord.

(1 Maccabees 6:31) 
Then, calling Judas, and gathering together in the city of Jerusalem: and they decided that this should be celebrated annually on the thirteenth day of the month Adar.

(1 Maccabees 6:32) 
And the land of Judah rested for a little while.

(1 Maccabees 7:1) 
In the year 151, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, departed from Rome, and came with his men of war, and began to reign in the land of his kingdom.

(1 Maccabees 7:2) 
And when he had come into his kingdom and was seated on the throne of his reign, all the unrighteous and wicked men of Israel gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:3) 
They chose Alcimus, who had been High Priest, and decided to make him High Priest, and brought him to the king.

(1 Maccabees 7:4) 
And they accused the people, saying, "John and those who were with him have stirred up a rebellion and incited the people to revolt."

(1 Maccabees 7:5) 
Moved by these words, the king, together with some of his wicked friends, summoned them to kill John.

(1 Maccabees 7:6) 
Those who came killed John and his two sons, and then they killed the sons of those who had opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:7) 
And Alcimus did this, and all the wicked men with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:8) 
Then the entire people gathered, and they were angry; and they killed them, and they appointed righteous men to avenge them.

(1 Maccabees 7:9) 
Then Judea said, "Wickedness has been removed from Israel."

(1 Maccabees 7:10) 
Then all of his brothers and those who were with him settled in the area, and they fought Israel during those days.

(1 Maccabees 7:11) 
Then the wicked men of Israel went out and sought all the wicked, and they went away, and took the evil from among them.

(1 Maccabees 7:12) 
And on that day, there was war, and Judas struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 7:13) 
When Jason saw the wickedness in Israel, and his friends who came to mock them, he fled to the region of the Ammonites.

(1 Maccabees 7:14) 
He placed leaders against the borders of the people, and gathered them against them, and struck them down, and in the place of their evils, and they struck down the sons of Israel.

(1 Maccabees 7:15) 
Then the sons of the strangers gathered together, and they came to attack Judea, and they went away from their own land.

(1 Maccabees 7:16) 
Then Simon and his brothers said, "In our days, in the days of our adversaries, we have gone forth from our land."

(1 Maccabees 7:17) 
And Judas gathered everyone together, and said, "Behold, I and my brothers, and the house of my father, we fight for the laws and the holy places."

(1 Maccabees 7:18) 
And all, because of this, rushed into battle.

(1 Maccabees 7:19) 
And he spoke, and all the nations feared him.

(1 Maccabees 7:20) 
Then Demetrius heard, and gathered his forces, and went to war in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:21) 
And he sent Nicanor, the commander of his army, to strike down the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 7:22) 
And when he approached Jerusalem, and saw the army of the Jews, he was afraid.

(1 Maccabees 7:23) 
And he feared the battle, and the fighting with the sons of Israel, and he wanted to return.

(1 Maccabees 7:24) 
And Nicanor blasphemed and swore, saying, "Unless the Jews are handed over into my hands, I will destroy the temple, and I will come and dwell there."

(1 Maccabees 7:25) 
And Judas heard the words of Nicanor, and he entered battle; and he was not afraid. And he fought against the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:26) 
And about five thousand men fell from the army of Nicanor.

(1 Maccabees 7:27) 
And Nicanor fled before the face of the army of the Jews, and he was struck down.

(1 Maccabees 7:28) 
And those who were in Judea, hearing that Nicanor had fallen, threw stones at them, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:29) 
And they released them, and attacked their nearest camps.

(1 Maccabees 7:30) 
And after doing this, they gathered and struck down Nicanor on the Sabbath day.

(1 Maccabees 7:31) 
And they placed their weapons, and their remains, and their heads, on a tree, and showed them.

(1 Maccabees 7:32) 
And all agreed, and swore, saying, "Blessed be the Lord, who has saved his people, and struck down the impious Nicanor, on that day."

(1 Maccabees 7:33) 
And they celebrated the fifteenth day of the month Adar, and on the same day, the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day.

(1 Maccabees 7:34) 
And thus it was said about the city of Jerusalem: "From the days of Nicanor, and even to this present day."

(1 Maccabees 7:35) 
And this is the end of Nicanor. And after Demetrius heard, he again sent Bacchides and Alcimus into Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:36) 
He gave him a very strong army and went into the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:37) 
And Bacchides hurried and came, and struck them on the Sabbath, and spoke and killed many.

(1 Maccabees 7:38) 
And Judas said: "Why, why have we come forth?" And they gathered around him.

(1 Maccabees 7:39) 
And Bacchides said: "Now, behold me and my people, I will strike and kill them."

(1 Maccabees 7:40) 
And they went out from Jerusalem, and came to Casalem, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:41) 
And from that day they struck them, and about fifteen men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 7:42) 
And Judas withdrew, and all those with him.

(1 Maccabees 7:43) 
And Bacchides gathered together and brought his men.

(1 Maccabees 7:44) 
And he came into the land of Judea, and struck them.

(1 Maccabees 7:45) 
And all went out from Jerusalem, and they did the same with them, and they killed many of the people.

(1 Maccabees 7:46) 
And Bacchides returned, and set up camp in Azed, and built fortified cities in Judea: a fortress in Jericho, and in Emmaus, and in Bethoron, and in Bethel, and Thamnas, and Phara, and Thephon, and in the cities that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 7:47) 
And he placed guards in them, and fortified them, and stored provisions, and gathered soldiers in them.

(1 Maccabees 7:48) 
And with the sons of Israel, and those who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 7:49) 
And they gathered, and came to Jerusalem, and guarded the city until death.

(1 Maccabees 7:50) 
And they cried out in the city of Jerusalem, and their voice cried out to heaven.

(1 Maccabees 8:1) 
The news about the Romans was heard, that they were very strong, and were better than all the other nations, even those they fought with.

(1 Maccabees 8:2) 
And because they had brought all the peoples to themselves, they received them into friendship, and made peace with them, and because they were powerful.

(1 Maccabees 8:3) 
They heard about their wars, and the acts of valor they did in Galatia, how they had conquered them, and subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:4) 
And how much they had conquered in the provinces, and in other nations, and that they had received all of them into friendship.

(1 Maccabees 8:5) 
And about the wars, which they had waged with King Philip, and with Perseus, King of the Macedonians, and with the remaining nations that had fought against them.

(1 Maccabees 8:6) 
And because those whom they had conquered had come with them into battle, and had offered peace themselves.

(1 Maccabees 8:7) 
And the war, which they waged in Galatia, and how they subdued them, and brought them under tribute.

(1 Maccabees 8:8) 
And how much they had done in their land, and how they had subdued them.

(1 Maccabees 8:9) 
And about the things that were heard about them, that they were very strong men, and were kindly disposed towards their friends, and made an alliance with those who cultivated them.

(1 Maccabees 8:10) 
Therefore, Judas and his brothers pleased the Romans, and sent to them, to make friendship, and an alliance, and to be a help to them.

(1 Maccabees 8:11) 
And the matter was accepted by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:12) 
Therefore, the Roman senators sent letters of this kind to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:13) 
To the Romans and to the people of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:14) 
If we are engaged in war against you, we will first take you as an aid.

(1 Maccabees 8:15) 
But if you undertake a war against us, we will assist you in the war.

(1 Maccabees 8:16) 
The Romans are witnesses to these letters, first of all.

(1 Maccabees 8:17) 
And they sent letters of this kind to Jerusalem, to the people of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 8:18) 
To Judas and his brothers, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 8:19) 
They sent us ambassadors to make friendship, and an alliance: so we received them.

(1 Maccabees 8:20) 
Therefore, we decided to write to you.

(1 Maccabees 8:21) 
Therefore, if anyone intends war against you in our land, we will fight for you, for as long as is necessary.

(1 Maccabees 8:22) 
And if they intend war against you, we will similarly fight for you.

(1 Maccabees 8:23) 
Therefore, they sent the letters to this effect, to the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 8:24) 
In the one hundred and forty-sixth year, and the beginning was in these matters, which the Jews, and those who were in Jerusalem, sent to the Romans, so that there might be friendship and alliance for them.

(1 Maccabees 9:1) 
During this time, Antiochus returned with his army from Persia and came into the city of Antioch.

(1 Maccabees 9:2) 
After entering, he took Lysias, the first of his ministers, and commanded him to lead an army, go to Judea, and destroy it.

(1 Maccabees 9:3) 
He sent him with troops, chosen men, and the king's officials. Lysias went with the army and came near Judea, near Emmaus.

(1 Maccabees 9:4) 
The Jews heard about their gathering. They gathered and placed with them Agathon and Judeus, brave men chosen for the fight.

(1 Maccabees 9:5) 
When they saw the army, they were afraid and went out of the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:6) 
The men with Lysias went to battle, and about five hundred men fell from their army.

(1 Maccabees 9:7) 
They saw that their forces had fallen and retreated to their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:8) 
Judas and his brothers saw that the wicked had diminished in strength, so they went against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:9) 
They fought and killed about eight thousand men.

(1 Maccabees 9:10) 
They scattered the rest in the camp, and all fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:11) 
Judas, hearing this, began to act bravely and, with a fortified spirit, sent chosen men to war.

(1 Maccabees 9:12) 
Simon also came with an army against Bethsura, and he fought and besieged it for a long time.

(1 Maccabees 9:13) 
But he was not able to capture it.

(1 Maccabees 9:14) 
Lysias heard that Judas and his brothers, very strong men, had done this, and that the entire multitude of the people and all their forces were gathering around them.

(1 Maccabees 9:15) 
He was very afraid and considered going to Galilee before fighting against them.

(1 Maccabees 9:16) 
He prepared and came into the region of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:17) 
Judas was with him, as was all the people, and they were ready for battle.

(1 Maccabees 9:18) 
When they rushed upon them and engaged, they fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:19) 
All those in the camp fled to the borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:20) 
About three thousand men fell by the sword from their camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:21) 
Judas pursued them.

(1 Maccabees 9:22) 
And he returned to the camp.

(1 Maccabees 9:23) 
Then Judas gathered them in Galilee and fought against them until he conquered all of Galilee.

(1 Maccabees 9:24) 
And John, who was called Esceneus, coming from the camp,

(1 Maccabees 9:25) 
Judas and his brothers went up to the mountain and fought.

(1 Maccabees 9:26) 
They killed Simon and his brothers, and John.

(1 Maccabees 9:27) 
And they gathered in the camp, and when they heard, they came with many men. They stayed there through the night and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:28) 
When Jonathan and Simon heard this, they retreated with those who were with them to the desert of Thecoe and camped near the water of the camp. They sent men to them from the camp in Thecoe.

(1 Maccabees 9:29) 
And when Jonathan heard, they turned back and struck in the camp; and many of them fell.

(1 Maccabees 9:30) 
Simon and those with him went out, joined the battle, and scattered and struck them down.

(1 Maccabees 9:31) 
And Jonathan, with his brothers and his own men, went into the camp to battle and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:32) 
And Jonathan and those with him, in the city, and in the city, and those who were there died.

(1 Maccabees 9:33) 
And they went out, struck, and captured everything in it.

(1 Maccabees 9:34) 
And it came to pass on the first day, there were about two thousand men; and on the second day, there were about four thousand.

(1 Maccabees 9:35) 
And seeing Jonathan and those who were with him, they fought against them, and they went out with their own, and with many men, and extended their hands and struck.

(1 Maccabees 9:36) 
And about eight thousand men fell from them.

(1 Maccabees 9:37) 
And Jonathan and those with him returned and took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 9:38) 
When he returned and came to Antioch, Lysias gathered and gave the opinion in council to the wise men.

(1 Maccabees 9:39) 
And they said that it should not happen anymore and that he should release them. They decreed that they should release them and depart from their borders.

(1 Maccabees 9:40) 
And it came to pass that in that year, Judas and his brothers went out, chose men, and sent them to Rome to make friendship and alliance with them, and to remove the yoke from themselves and the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:41) 
And the word pleased them, and they commanded the men who were sent to make friendship with them.

(1 Maccabees 9:42) 
And they sent letters to Judas and his brothers, saying: "To the people of the Jews and their brothers, greetings, friendship, and help.

(1 Maccabees 9:43) 
And it came to pass, and they decreed that they would give them help and depart from the kingdom of the Macedonians.

(1 Maccabees 9:44) 
And they wrote on bronze tablets and sent them to Rome, so that there would be a memorial of the friendship with them and with the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 9:45) 
And it came to pass, after these things, that Antiochus sent to the region of Persia and gathered a large army.

(1 Maccabees 9:46) 
And he went into Persia, and those who believed in his power were with him.

(1 Maccabees 9:47) 
They came to the city called Elymais and wanted to take the temple and guard the city.

(1 Maccabees 9:48) 
But they could not, because the plan of the city was revealed to them.

(1 Maccabees 9:49) 
And those in the city drove them out.

(1 Maccabees 9:50) 
And it came to pass that they returned to Babylonia again.

(1 Maccabees 9:51) 
And a messenger came to him in Persia, saying that the armies that were in Judea had fled.

(1 Maccabees 9:52) 
And those who had been sent to battle by the Jews had gone out and were scattered in the camps.

(1 Maccabees 9:53) 
And Antiochus considered that he would come immediately into Judea and decided to set out and prepare everything with anger.

(1 Maccabees 9:54) 
And while he was saying this, it happened that he was struck immediately and released. He fell on the mountains.

(1 Maccabees 9:55) 
And they received him, and he was on a bed, paralyzed.

(1 Maccabees 9:56) 
And he was dying, and he cried out, recognizing, and said: "I am dying in great misery.

(1 Maccabees 9:57) 
And as he was dying, he heard that the soldiers in Persia had been scattered, and that they were being pursued and killed.

(1 Maccabees 9:58) 
And when he heard the word, he cried out: "I go, and I depart, all of mine." And he went into Persia and died.

(1 Maccabees 9:59) 
And they buried him, and his son Antiochus reigned in his place.

(1 Maccabees 10:1) 
In the one hundred and sixtieth year, Simon, the brother of Jonathan, declared himself to be High Priest, succeeding his brother Jonathan.

(1 Maccabees 10:2) 
In those days, Judas was fighting against the Gentiles.

(1 Maccabees 10:3) 
And the people of Israel gathered together.

(1 Maccabees 10:4) 
Seeing that the people were seeking and in fear, Simon took action.

(1 Maccabees 10:5) 
And he chose men and sent them to King Demetrius, to ask him to withdraw the decrees he had issued against the Jews, and against the land of Judea, and to release those who were held captive in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:6) 
And King Demetrius sent them, according to the words he had spoken to them, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 10:7) 
And he wrote letters to the Jews, saying: “King Demetrius to the people of the Jews, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 10:8) 
“Because we remember you, the Jews, and your friends, and have made arrangements in accordance with them, and have received what you have done for us.”

(1 Maccabees 10:9) 
“Therefore, we have judged it right to write to you and the other Jews, saying: 'All those from Judea who come to us up to this day, let them have peace, and be without any trouble.'

(1 Maccabees 10:10) 
“And we declare all the Jews who have departed from your land up to this day, to be free from taxation and from all the tributes of the land.

(1 Maccabees 10:11) 
“Concerning all the tributes, and the salt tax, and the crown taxes which belonged to us, we release all of them and give them to you and the other Jews.

(1 Maccabees 10:12) 
“And anyone of you who is inscribed in our books, let them be your people, and those of you who have come to this day, let them be with you.

(1 Maccabees 10:13) 
“And I command the Alexandrians and all my officials: To assist you in these matters, and to establish your peace.

(1 Maccabees 10:14) 
“And what the Jews have determined for you up to this day, I also establish. And I have removed the taxes which they paid in the earlier days.”

(1 Maccabees 10:15) 
“And these things I write to you, I do for you and the other Jews, and I establish all peace in your land.”

(1 Maccabees 10:16) 
In the one hundred and fifty-fourth year, the Jews in Judea, the sons of Israel who were in captivity, departed and returned and rebuilt.

(1 Maccabees 10:17) 
And they crowned Mount Zion, and those who were with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:18) 
And the sons of Alexander, who were in Macedonia, came and established Ptolemy as king.

(1 Maccabees 10:19) 
And King Ptolemy sent to Simon the High Priest, to give him honor.

(1 Maccabees 10:20) 
And he did this. And he appointed him and his friends, and gave him many gifts, and confirmed his friendship with them, and appointed him as High Priest, and for all things that pertained to him.

(1 Maccabees 10:21) 
And they captured the city called Gazara, Ptolemy and Simon.

(1 Maccabees 10:22) 
And they fought against it a great deal, and they set it on fire, and plundered all its spoils.

(1 Maccabees 10:23) 
And they put to death the inhabitants of Gazara, and exterminated all the wickedness there.

(1 Maccabees 10:24) 
And the Jews came with Simon to Jerusalem, and they purified it, and cast out all that was unclean, and they made good inhabitants there.

(1 Maccabees 10:25) 
And on the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, they entered it with praise and palms, and with lyres, cymbals, psalteries, hymns and canticles.

(1 Maccabees 10:26) 
And they established a day each year, so that they would celebrate this day as a day of joy.

(1 Maccabees 10:27) 
And they established the land of Judea, and the priesthood, and the people, and the garrisons, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works that were in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 10:28) 
And Simon said to himself and to his friends: “Because if those on our side fight, and if enemies come, we will not be able to resist, because of the war.”

(1 Maccabees 10:29) 
And he established Judea, and built in Jericho, and in Galilee, and in Hazor, and in Emmanuel, and in Bethsura, and in Bethlehem, and in all the places which he fortified.

(1 Maccabees 10:30) 
And he fortified them, and placed garrisons in them, and stored provisions in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:31) 
And Simon gathered all the men of war, and placed garrisons, and stored weapons in them.

(1 Maccabees 10:32) 
And John and all those who were in Judea made peace with him.

(1 Maccabees 10:33) 
And the people saw that Simon was working for their salvation, and they gave him honor and glory.

(1 Maccabees 10:34) 
And they made him a leader and High Priest, and all the Jews made him their friend.

(1 Maccabees 10:35) 
And they declared him to be in charge of all, and of all the affairs of the land, and of the weapons.

(1 Maccabees 10:36) 
And Simon heard that the Romans had heard from the Gentiles, that they had heard that they were more powerful, and they agreed to everything that was commanded to them.

(1 Maccabees 10:37) 
And they gave their friendship to Simon, and they accepted his alliance.

(1 Maccabees 10:38) 
And they sent to them, and established for him a golden shield, and gave him honor, so that he might be with them.

(1 Maccabees 10:39) 
And the people heard these words, and said: “How shall we give him honor?

(1 Maccabees 10:40) 
And they resolved to give him a great praise, and to honor him, and to glorify him.

(1 Maccabees 10:41) 
And all the Jews did this: And they made him a leader and High Priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 10:42) 
And he was in charge of the Jews, and all the priests, and all the people.

(1 Maccabees 10:43) 
And furthermore, all the affairs of the land, and the wars, and the weapons, and the cities, and all the works.

(1 Maccabees 10:44) 
And they established in him all things, as before.

(1 Maccabees 10:45) 
And all the people rejoiced in his works.

(1 Maccabees 10:46) 
And as Simon worked with honor and glory, in the land and in Jerusalem, so he established all the peoples in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:1) 
In the one hundred and fiftieth year of the kingdom of the Greeks, the Romans went to Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, saying that he should give them help and take them out of the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:2) 
Then King Ptolemy answered, "I am the king of Egypt. I have come to my own land, and I have given them help, and I have restored the land to the city, and you shall not depart from me."

(1 Maccabees 11:3) 
And a war was fought against Alexander, because the Romans were in everything with Ptolemy, and Ptolemy prevailed and they departed from the land.

(1 Maccabees 11:4) 
And Ptolemy gathered all his forces and came into Syria and took many cities and killed them.

(1 Maccabees 11:5) 
And he sent a great letter to Simon and made an appointment with him in Ammathunte, which is near the mountain, that he should come to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:6) 
And he went to him and saw his glory, his army, and his equipment and was afraid, and he acted against him and did not want to do him harm.

(1 Maccabees 11:7) 
And they said to him that they would do whatever they wished against Simon, and make him king, and whoever was their friend or enemy.

(1 Maccabees 11:8) 
And because Simon saw that he was angry, he was afraid and laid his hands on him, and did him violence, for he was an old man.

(1 Maccabees 11:9) 
And they killed him and his sons and his brothers. And he sent and sent his army and killed them and inflicted violence on them.

(1 Maccabees 11:10) 
And war was made, and the children of Israel went out of the field and came to the place of battles, and he was angry and prevailed.

(1 Maccabees 11:11) 
And Alexander, the king of Syria, hearing of this, gathered all his forces together and came into Syria.

(1 Maccabees 11:12) 
And he gathered a very large army and prevailed against Ptolemy and drove him from his land.

(1 Maccabees 11:13) 
And Alexander fought a war in the land, and those from the strongest cities came to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:14) 
And he gave him a very strong city, and he made him the leader of all who were around him.

(1 Maccabees 11:15) 
And Jonathan, hearing of this, sent ambassadors to him, asking him to make friendship with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:16) 
And he was accepted by him and sent letters to him saying:

(1 Maccabees 11:17) 
King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 11:18) 
We have heard of you that you are a man powerful in virtue and that you deserve to be our friend.

(1 Maccabees 11:19) 
Therefore, we have appointed you today to be a high priest and one of the king's friends.

(1 Maccabees 11:20) 
And he sent him a purple cloak and a golden crown, and he gave them to him.

(1 Maccabees 11:21) 
And Jonathan put them on, and was in the day of the feast of the seventh month, and began to go out to the people and sacrifice.

(1 Maccabees 11:22) 
And King Alexander, hearing this, made him a friend, even before he was with him.

(1 Maccabees 11:23) 
And he wrote to him, saying: "Why have you given your people the law, and made a covenant with the Romans?"

(1 Maccabees 11:24) 
And he was very angry and acted against him, and Alexander, hearing this, gathered great forces.

(1 Maccabees 11:25) 
And he commanded Jonathan and brought him before the king in Ptolemais. And the king came and met him and fought.

(1 Maccabees 11:26) 
And they fled from Ptolemais and pursued them to the gates, and about three thousand men fell from Ptolemais.

(1 Maccabees 11:27) 
And Jonathan took Alexander's sword, and they went out of the city and fled.

(1 Maccabees 11:28) 
And Jonathan fought in Bethsura, and they came together in battle.

(1 Maccabees 11:29) 
And Alexander sent letters to Jonathan in peace. And Jonathan sent to him, for he was acting in peace and to him, in peace.

(1 Maccabees 11:30) 
And King Alexander put Jonathan in honor and gave him possessions and divisions.

(1 Maccabees 11:31) 
And Jonathan went out to Ptolemais, and King Alexander met him, and he honored him greatly.

(1 Maccabees 11:32) 
And he took him and they met and slept together.

(1 Maccabees 11:33) 
And Alexander went out and went into Egypt and reigned.

(1 Maccabees 11:34) 
And Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, died, and he made his son Philip reign, who was in Egypt for eighteen years.

(1 Maccabees 11:35) 
And Philip died, and Demetrius reigned.

(1 Maccabees 12:1) 
In the year one hundred and forty-four, those who were in Rome sent greetings to the people of Macedonia and to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:2) 
The Jews in Judea received this message.

(1 Maccabees 12:3) 
They also sent to the Romans, Athenians, Chaldeans, and all the nations gathered in the same place in the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:4) 
This is a copy of the letter: "The Jewish brothers send greetings and prosperity to the people of Rome.

(1 Maccabees 12:5) 
If you are well, we are well.

(1 Maccabees 12:6) 
Because of the war we had with Philip and those who were with him, we have had to deal with various events, which concerned both you and us.

(1 Maccabees 12:7) 
You sent us a letter and we sent you one also, asking that we might confirm our treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:8) 
So, at the time we wrote to you, we wrote to our Jewish brothers and your priests. We asked them not to ignore but to observe these things.

(1 Maccabees 12:9) 
We are hoping what we have agreed upon is what you agree upon also.

(1 Maccabees 12:10) 
Therefore, we are sending you Antiochus and Jason, the sons of Jason, and the Romans sent them to you to confirm what we have written, and for you to confirm what we have written.

(1 Maccabees 12:11) 
And now, farewell.""

(1 Maccabees 12:12) 
This letter was written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:13) 
They wrote to those who were in Judea, and to the Jews who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 12:14) 
"Jewish brothers, greetings and prosperity.

(1 Maccabees 12:15) 
The people of Rome and the Jews wish you peace and prosperity forever. May God grant you grace, both now and in the future.

(1 Maccabees 12:16) 
The Romans sent envoys to us to confirm friendship and a treaty with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:17) 
They established decrees so that we, our people, you, and your land would not wage war.

(1 Maccabees 12:18) 
Therefore, if war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:19) 
Likewise, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:20) 
We have confirmed these things just as they decreed.

(1 Maccabees 12:21) 
These words were written in Rome on the first days of the month of Spartius.

(1 Maccabees 12:22) 
Then they sent letters to King Demetrius and to every nation in Asia, and to those in Judea, and to those at peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:23) 
Jewish brothers, greetings, prosperity, and health.

(1 Maccabees 12:24) 
Demetrius and his ancestors have made peace with you and the Jewish people.

(1 Maccabees 12:25) 
We have confirmed these words we wrote to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:26) 
So, if you want to make a treaty with us, write to us, and we will write to you.

(1 Maccabees 12:27) 
The people confirmed that Demetrius had granted us peace.

(1 Maccabees 12:28) 
For King Demetrius saw that the Jewish people belonged to God, and that they fought against those who opposed them.

(1 Maccabees 12:29) 
He included them among his friends and sent them honors.

(1 Maccabees 12:30) 
This was during the days when they wrote to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 12:31) 
At the command of the Romans, letters were sent to the Jews, saying, "Greetings and prosperity to the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 12:32) 
The people of Rome and their allies send peace, strength, and prosperity to the Jewish nation forever.

(1 Maccabees 12:33) 
If war is first waged against you by the Romans or any of their allies, we will defend you to the best of our ability.

(1 Maccabees 12:34) 
Again, if war is first waged against the Romans, we will join with you.

(1 Maccabees 12:35) 
These words, written, we sent them to those in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 13:1) 
In the one hundred and forty-ninth year, King Demetrius wrote letters to Simon the high priest and leader of the people, and to his friends, and to the Jewish people, both those in Judea and those in other lands, offering greetings of peace.

(1 Maccabees 13:2) 
The letters read: “King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:3) 
“Because of the troubles the Jews had caused, we have decided, though with much pain, to acknowledge their strength, courage, and honor. So we will do as the Jews wish.”

(1 Maccabees 13:4) 
“Therefore, we decree to them and their friends, and to the land of Judea, freedom and release: and we let go and forgive them all things which the Jews have taken until this day, and all the crimes they committed.”

(1 Maccabees 13:5) 
“Let all that they did through ignorance or in secret be forgiven.”

(1 Maccabees 13:6) 
“We will provide for the construction of the Temple and the repair of its walls, as well as the other expenses that were required.”

(1 Maccabees 13:7) 
“Furthermore, the Jews will be free to do whatever they want.”

(1 Maccabees 13:8) 
“We grant them permission to use grain, weapons, and the other supplies and tributes given to them, for the building of Jerusalem.”

(1 Maccabees 13:9) 
All of these decrees were written in public records, and they made Simon the leader, to be the high priest, with the care of the Temple, and to give him great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:10) 
The people heard these words and said, “Great is the faithfulness of Simon and his sons.”

(1 Maccabees 13:11) 
And because all the people and the priests agreed, they chose Simon to be their leader and priest.

(1 Maccabees 13:12) 
He was to have care of the Temple and its ministers and be in charge of everything.

(1 Maccabees 13:13) 
They also decided to write in the public records and place in a holy place that Simon was their leader, and this was to last forever. And everyone did him homage.

(1 Maccabees 13:14) 
The Jews made a covenant with Simon that, as long as he lived, he would be their leader and high priest, and his sons as long as they lived.

(1 Maccabees 13:15) 
They refused to deal with the other nations and their wicked ways.

(1 Maccabees 13:16) 
Simon built fortresses in Judea and fortified them with defenses and weapons and gathered troops.

(1 Maccabees 13:17) 
And he sent peace to King Demetrius.

(1 Maccabees 13:18) 
In turn, King Demetrius heard him, confirmed his position, and recognized his authority.

(1 Maccabees 13:19) 
He gave him testimony, and honored him.

(1 Maccabees 13:20) 
He also learned that the Romans and Spartans sent envoys to him to make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:21) 
They met, made an alliance, and established a treaty with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:22) 
He also heard that the Romans sent to him envoys, excellent and most beloved men, with great honor.

(1 Maccabees 13:23) 
And they sent them to him to confirm the alliance and the treaty they had made with him.

(1 Maccabees 13:24) 
They sent him letters on bronze tablets, in which was written: “The people of Rome and the Spartans to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:25) 
“We have received the letters and tablets that you sent to us.

(1 Maccabees 13:26) 
“And we have established a treaty and alliance with you, and we write saying: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:27) 
“If we wage war against you, your people, and your land, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 13:28) 
“This is the testimony of these words which we send to you. And we have written them on bronze tablets and placed them in a holy place so that we may keep them with you there.”

(1 Maccabees 13:29) 
And this is the example of the writing that was sent by the Romans.

(1 Maccabees 13:30) 
The Romans and Spartans, to Simon, the high priest, his friends, and the Jewish people, greetings.

(1 Maccabees 13:31) 
We have sent our envoys to you to make an alliance and treaty with you, and it has pleased us to do so.

(1 Maccabees 13:32) 
And this is what is written on the bronze tablets that we have written: If anyone wages war against you, your people, and your land, we will not fight against you.

(1 Maccabees 13:33) 
“And if they first wage war against us, we will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 14:1) 
In the one hundred and sixty-ninth year of the world, the Romans, at the right moment, sent to Simon the high priest, the leaders of the Jewish people, and the senate of the Jews to treat of peace and establish alliances.

(1 Maccabees 14:2) 
They sent this message: "We have come to you and to your people because of your honor and glory. We seek a partnership and friendship with you.

(1 Maccabees 14:3) 
We now wish to take up arms and offer help to you against all your enemies."

(1 Maccabees 14:4) 
Their words were well received by the people and the priests.

(1 Maccabees 14:5) 
So the people said, "Let us ask Simon to make peace with us!" And they made peace with them.

(1 Maccabees 14:6) 
Simon welcomed them and appointed them as leaders and officials. He gave them weapons and help.

(1 Maccabees 14:7) 
Simon told the people, "We and our brothers and the family of our father fought many battles and struggles. We faced many hardships for the Law and the sanctuary, and we were saved.

(1 Maccabees 14:8) 
Therefore, today we hold the power.

(1 Maccabees 14:9) 
In this same year, Demetrius was taken captive. The Jews then gathered and went to Demetrius to honor him.

(1 Maccabees 14:10) 
Demetrius sent a message to them, gathered his army, and said, "I and my brothers, and my father's family, fought for the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:11) 
When they came, we gave them help and granted them honor, Jerusalem, and all their possessions. I confirmed all of this and gave it to them.

(1 Maccabees 14:12) 
I confirmed all things that are and will be for as long as this continues."

(1 Maccabees 14:13) 
So all the men, all the leaders of the people, and the priests decided that Simon should be their friend and make an alliance with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:14) 
They heard this and were pleased, and they decided to write it down on tablets and place them before their eyes.

(1 Maccabees 14:15) 
They wrote on the tablets: "In the one hundred and seventieth year, the Jews, priests, and the people have cast off the yoke of the Gentiles, along with all the abominations and great pride.

(1 Maccabees 14:16) 
They established Simon as their leader and high priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:17) 
He would be their leader and care for the sanctuary. He would be in charge of all their works.

(1 Maccabees 14:18) 
He would be in charge of the weapons, the fortifications, the vessels, and the works of the Temple.

(1 Maccabees 14:19) 
His sons would all hold positions of dignity and would succeed their father.

(1 Maccabees 14:20) 
Simon appointed his sons and gave them weapons and an army. He instructed them to conduct the war and establish armies in the land.

(1 Maccabees 14:21) 
They appointed Simon as the leader in Jerusalem so that he could build fortifications and guard them. He built high walls, great towers, a large house, and fortifications all around.

(1 Maccabees 14:22) 
Simon sent a message to Demetrius and gave him a golden crown and palm branches. He sent gifts from Jerusalem and the trees within it, and it was done.

(1 Maccabees 14:23) 
He struck the people and the people who were in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 14:24) 
He heard that the Romans and the people in the land of the Jews had heard that they had appointed Simon as their leader and high priest. He heard that Simon and his brothers had made an alliance with them, and that they had done it with him.

(1 Maccabees 14:25) 
They welcomed him and wrote it on bronze tablets to be placed on the Mount Zion. These are the examples:

(1 Maccabees 14:26) 
In the one hundred and seventy-second year, under Simon, the great high priest, leader, and governor of the Jews, and his brothers,

(1 Maccabees 14:27) 
the Jews had gathered after they had rebelled and fled from the land of the wicked.

(1 Maccabees 14:28) 
They gathered and came to Jerusalem and ascended Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:29) 
They saw that the sanctuary had been defiled and polluted.

(1 Maccabees 14:30) 
They decided, and after they had purified themselves, they appointed Simon and gave him weapons.

(1 Maccabees 14:31) 
They established him as high priest and his sons forever, until a faithful prophet would arise.

(1 Maccabees 14:32) 
And it was throughout all the land of the Jews.

(1 Maccabees 14:33) 
Then it happened that they rebuilt Jerusalem and the fortifications that were all around, and the house, and the walls around Mount Zion.

(1 Maccabees 14:34) 
And this is the example that was created in their days.

(1 Maccabees 15:1) 
Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, sent letters from Rome, written on tablets, to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to those in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:2) 
The words in the letter were these: “King Demetrius sends greetings to the Jewish nation, and to the Senate, and to the Jews who are in Judea, greetings and peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:3) 
“Because we remember your good spirit, and goodwill towards us, and the friendship and favor that you have shown towards us, and for this, we are glad.”

(1 Maccabees 15:4) 
“For this reason, we have decreed for you, and for your race, immunity from taxes, and we give to you whatever we give to other nations.”

(1 Maccabees 15:5) 
“And now, I release you, and the Jews, and the people of Jerusalem, and your borders, and I will rebuild the city, and I will restore the vessels, and whatever was taken from the Temple, I will return to you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:6) 
And quickly, he sent letters to Jonathan, saying thus:

(1 Maccabees 15:7) 
“King Demetrius to the brother Jonathan, and to the Jews, and to the Senate of the Jews, and to the rest who are with them, greetings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:8) 
“Because we have heard you, and we have decreed as you have said, and we have commanded our servants who are with us, to make peace with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:9) 
“We will affirm the testimony which comes from us to you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:10) 
“That whatever you have decided with our people be ratified. But if there were any decrees made by those who didn't know, we will amend them.”

(1 Maccabees 15:11) 
“And now we have commanded our servants to speak with you in peace, and to obey you in peace.”

(1 Maccabees 15:12) 
And these letters were written in the one hundred and seventieth year, and in that year, the wars and battles ceased.

(1 Maccabees 15:13) 
And the king of the Romans heard that they had been sent into Judea, and said:

(1 Maccabees 15:14) 
“We also will send to those who are in Judea, and we will send to them who are in Judea, peace and friendship, so that they might be enrolled with Jonathan and with the Jews.”

(1 Maccabees 15:15) 
And he sent letters into Judea, and said: “The Senate of the Romans, to Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, greetings and happiness.”

(1 Maccabees 15:16) 
“If you have undertaken a war against us, we do not have one, because we do not fight with you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:17) 
“Now, therefore, we know that you have been chosen as our friends and allies:”

(1 Maccabees 15:18) 
“And we have commanded that henceforth we will speak with you:”

(1 Maccabees 15:19) 
“Just as to our people, and in our kingdom, and whatever you send to us, we will do well for you.”

(1 Maccabees 15:20) 
And this which the Romans wrote to the Jews, on bronze tablets, so that they might have a reminder of peace and help, and they sent it to Rome, to have it with them.

(1 Maccabees 15:21) 
After this, indeed, Simon, also writing, sent to Jonathan his brother, and he was with him for the support of the wars, and he appointed the entire army and sent it to him.

(1 Maccabees 15:22) 
And Numenius, the son of Antioch, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, the envoys from Judea, heard that the Jewish people had been mistreated.

(1 Maccabees 15:23) 
And they began to search, and they wanted to kill those who were with Jonathan, but they could not:

(1 Maccabees 15:24) 
because Jonathan had been informed, and he delivered them, and they could not do anything against them.

(1 Maccabees 15:25) 
And they came to Gaza, and those who were in Gaza expelled them, and Jonathan and those with him shut them in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:26) 
And the Lord knew, and gave them into his hand.

(1 Maccabees 15:27) 
And he fought against them and those who had come, and all those who were with them on the land, and he set fire to the gates, which were around Gaza, and plundered them, and burned them.

(1 Maccabees 15:28) 
And they fought against them, and all who were with him, and killed them; and they took great spoils from them.

(1 Maccabees 15:29) 
And it happened that, when Demetrius heard that Jonathan and those with him had come to the camp against him, and were fighting, and had become very strong, and had routed them in battle,

(1 Maccabees 15:30) 
he was very angry.

(1 Maccabees 15:31) 
And immediately he sent, and gathered the strongest men, and gave orders, and the army came.

(1 Maccabees 15:32) 
And he came to Antioch, and appointed two commanders of his army against them, and against those who were with Jonathan, and commanded them to come quickly.

(1 Maccabees 15:33) 
And he came to Jonathan, and said: “We are against you.” And Jonathan and those with him went out to battle, and they fought.

(1 Maccabees 15:34) 
And they were sent into their camp, and those with Jonathan conquered all, and they fled.

(1 Maccabees 15:35) 
And Jonathan and those who were with him took their spoils.

(1 Maccabees 15:36) 
And he struck those in Ashkelon, and those who were with him, and they went out from their land.

(1 Maccabees 15:37) 
And the next day, he went to Beth-zur, a fortified city, and they met him, and greeted him, and gave him and those who were with him many things.

(1 Maccabees 15:38) 
And King Demetrius, hearing these things, sent again to Beth-zur, and wrote letters:

(1 Maccabees 15:39) 
“Peace to Jonathan, and to the Jewish nation, and to the army:”

(1 Maccabees 15:40) 
“Because I have fought for you, and for your brothers, and for your sons, and I have caused them to come, and I have sent them to you, with all their belongings.”

(1 Maccabees 15:41) 
“Therefore, if any of them who are in Judea have fled from their places, and have come to me, I will vindicate them for you and for your brothers.”

(1 Maccabees 15:42) 
“And now I will appoint you as allies and friends, and I will send you to my court, so that you may see what is necessary for me.”

(1 Maccabees 15:43) 
And he sent into the city of Jerusalem, to give them gifts, and sacrifices, and pleasant things, and they granted and gave to them.

(1 Maccabees 15:44) 
And they received, and then, and they built with Jonathan, and with all his brothers, and with him who was in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 15:45) 
And they all saw the works of Jonathan, and that he fought, and endured most bravely, and all the labor, and they joined with him.

(1 Maccabees 15:46) 
And they chose him, and appointed him as their leader, and waged war with the nations, and with the nations, and in Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:1) 
In the one hundred and fifty-ninth year, King Demetrius sent letters and gathered the people in a great multitude, and he entered the land of Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:2) 
Upon hearing this, Jonathan ordered an army to go out of Jerusalem to confront him, and they attacked them.

(1 Maccabees 16:3) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace and with a great promise because he was growing weak.

(1 Maccabees 16:4) 
He said, “Let us strike first before they join with Alexander, and let us do these things to him.”

(1 Maccabees 16:5) 
Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan, saying, “We will make you and your friends and your holy city great, and if you do these things for us, you will have whatever you ask of us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:6) 
Then Jonathan, in Jerusalem, supplied the people with weapons and said to them, “We will fight for you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:7) 
And Jonathan selected the men of war and prepared, and fought against Demetrius, and the army departed from the land, and the army that was with Demetrius came.

(1 Maccabees 16:8) 
And they came into the land of Judea, and Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan in peace, and said, “Let us not do this to you.”

(1 Maccabees 16:9) 
And he gave him glory and confirmed him and all the prisoners he released.

(1 Maccabees 16:10) 
Then he came to Jerusalem and entered the house of the temple and heard that John, the son of Absalom, was in Gadara, and he stationed himself in Gadara.

(1 Maccabees 16:11) 
And he sent men from Gadara to take him, and those sent came and struck him and killed him.

(1 Maccabees 16:12) 
And as for the rest of the words of John, and his deeds, and the virtues which he did, are these not written in the book of the days of John?

(1 Maccabees 16:13) 
And there was great pride among the people, and they knew that John was dead.

(1 Maccabees 16:14) 
And they sent and apprehended and killed the sons of Jambri and those in Gazara, and after this, a fight began again in Judea.

(1 Maccabees 16:15) 
And Jonathan gathered all the people and went out to war, and he came to Casali and placed the camp there.

(1 Maccabees 16:16) 
And Simon sent and placed the camp opposite Casali, and they fought for many days.

(1 Maccabees 16:17) 
And those in Casali made peace with Jonathan and gave him their right hands, and he took them and went into Jerusalem.

(1 Maccabees 16:18) 
And Jonathan chose elders and sought counsel and gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:19) 
And Tryphon, hearing that Jonathan had gathered many troops, planned to kill him.

(1 Maccabees 16:20) 
And he came to Bethsan and went out against him, and Jonathan went to Bethsan with forty chosen men.

(1 Maccabees 16:21) 
And Tryphon knew, and he set an ambush there to kill him, and they were with him.

(1 Maccabees 16:22) 
And Jonathan said to Simon his brother, “Choose men and go out, and we will fight for our brothers, and their fear will not disturb them.”

(1 Maccabees 16:23) 
And he gave them weapons and said to them, “Fight until we die.”

(1 Maccabees 16:24) 
And Jonathan and those with him fought, and Simon and those with him fell.

(1 Maccabees 16:25) 
And the people were sorrowful and knew that Jonathan was dead, and they mourned for him, and they were...

(1 Maccabees 16:26) 
But he gathered all those who were in the land and gathered all those who were in the borders of Judea, to make war against those who were in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:27) 
And Simon went out and placed the camp against them, and they fought for many days, and they stationed themselves.

(1 Maccabees 16:28) 
And he took them and pursued them and struck the men of war and broke their hands.

(1 Maccabees 16:29) 
And he gathered and placed the camp against the city and built towers.

(1 Maccabees 16:30) 
And Simon and those with him took and gave them weapons of war and placed the camp, and they gave them weapons of war.

(1 Maccabees 16:31) 
And they gave them peace, and they went out of the land, and he took the city and cleansed it from defilement and brought inhabitants into it and built in it.

(1 Maccabees 16:32) 
And those who were in the land of Judea saw the works of Simon and the glory which he did for his people, and he gathered the elders and the older men.

(1 Maccabees 16:33) 
And they said to themselves, “Let us make Simon king and his sons and his people, and he will fight for us.”

(1 Maccabees 16:34) 
And these words pleased the people, and they made Simon king for all the days of his life and his sons until he died.

(1 Maccabees 16:35) 
And he made a pact with them and took the camps with them.

(1 Maccabees 16:36) 
And there was war in the land, and he ceased, and Simon was glorified and gave peace in the land.

(1 Maccabees 16:37) 
And he built in Judea a great wall around Jerusalem and built high places and great towers around Jerusalem and around them.

(1 Maccabees 16:38) 
And he sent Jonathan into the army to gather and have weapons of war and gave them weapons of war.
