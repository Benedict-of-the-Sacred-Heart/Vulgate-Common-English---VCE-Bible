(1 John 1:1) 
The Son of God, who has always existed from the beginning, is the one we personally heard, the one we actually saw with our own eyes, the one we looked at closely, and the one we physically touched with our hands—this is the Son who is the Word of Life.

(1 John 1:2) 
And this divine life was made physically clear to us. We saw it, and we are testifying and proclaiming to you this eternal life—the very life that was eternally with God the Father and then appeared among us.

(1 John 1:3) 
What we saw and heard with our own senses, we now proclaim to you. We do this so that you may share in our spiritual fellowship, and our fellowship is truly with God the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 1:4) 
And we are writing these things to you so that you may have complete and perfect joy.

(1 John 1:5) 
And this is the essential message we heard directly from Him—from Jesus Christ—and which we now proclaim to you: God is pure light, and there is absolutely no darkness or evil within Him.

(1 John 1:6) 
If we claim to have spiritual communion with God, yet we continue to live in sin and error, then we are lying, and we are not living according to God's truth.

(1 John 1:7) 
But if we live according to God's truth—just as He Himself is in pure truth and light—then we truly have spiritual fellowship with each other, and the cleansing sacrifice of Jesus Christ, His Son, washes away all our sins.

(1 John 1:8) 
If we say that we have no sin, we are only deceiving ourselves, and the truth of God is not truly present within us.

(1 John 1:9) 
If we confess our sins to God, He is faithful to His promises and just in His nature. He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us completely from every unrighteous act.

(1 John 1:10) 
If we claim that we have not sinned, then we are essentially calling God a liar, and His divine message is not genuinely present in our hearts.

(1 John 2:1) 
My dear children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. But even if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is perfectly just. He intercedes for us before God.

(1 John 2:2) 
And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins—meaning His sacrifice atones for and turns away God's just wrath. This is not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world, offering salvation to all who accept it.

(1 John 2:3) 
And by this we know and are sure that we have truly come to know Him, if we keep His commandments and live according to His will.

(1 John 2:4) 
Whoever claims to know Him, yet does not keep His commandments, is a liar. The truth and the reality of faith are not in that person.

(1 John 2:5) 
But whoever keeps His word, truly in that person the love of God is perfected and brought to its full expression. And by this we know that we are abiding in Him.

(1 John 2:6) 
Whoever claims to abide in Christ ought to walk himself, living his life and conducting his affairs, just as Christ walked and lived.

(1 John 2:7) 
Beloved ones, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the very beginning of your faith. This old commandment is the Word of truth which you heard when you first believed.

(1 John 2:8) 
Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true both in Christ Himself and in you, His followers. This is because the spiritual darkness of sin and ignorance has passed away, and the true light of Christ is already shining in the world and in your hearts.

(1 John 2:9) 
Whoever says he is in the light of Christ, yet hates his brother, is in spiritual darkness even until now, despite his claim.

(1 John 2:10) 
Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling or leading others to sin in him.

(1 John 2:11) 
But whoever hates his brother is in darkness and walks blindly in darkness, and he does not know where he is going, because the spiritual darkness of hatred has blinded his eyes.

(1 John 2:12) 
I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven you through the power and authority of His Name, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 2:13) 
I write to you, fathers in faith (those spiritually mature), because you have come to know Him who is from the very beginning, the eternal God. I write to you, young men (those actively engaged in spiritual struggle), because you have overcome the Evil One, Satan.

(1 John 2:14) 
I have written to you, children (new believers), because you have come to know God the Father. I have written to you, fathers in faith, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong in your faith, and the Word of God abides deeply within you, and you have overcome the Evil One.

(1 John 2:15) 
Do not love the world, meaning the fallen and sinful system of human society that is opposed to God, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world in this way, the love of God the Father is not in him.

(1 John 2:16) 
For everything that is in the world—that is, the temptations and values of this fallen system—is the disordered desire of the flesh (sensual cravings), and the disordered desire of the eyes (covetousness and lustful looking), and the pride of life (arrogance and self-glory). These desires are not from the Father, but originate from the world.

(1 John 2:17) 
And the world, with all its fleeting glory and sinful desires, is passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains eternally, possessing true and lasting life.

(1 John 2:18) 
Dear children, it is the final hour of this present age, the time between Christ's first and second comings. And just as you heard that *the* Antichrist, the ultimate adversary of Christ, is coming, even now many antichrists—those who oppose Christ—have appeared. From this fact, we know that it is the final hour.

(1 John 2:19) 
These antichrists went out from among us, meaning they were once part of the Christian community, but they were not truly of us in genuine faith. For if they had been truly of us, they would have remained with us. But they left so that it might be made manifest and clear that they are not truly of us.

(1 John 2:20) 
But you, believers, have an anointing from the Holy One—that is, from Christ or through the Holy Spirit—and you know all necessary truths for salvation and discernment.

(1 John 2:21) 
I have not written to you as if you are ignorant of the truth, but as those who already know it. And I write because it is clear that no lie can ever come from the truth; they are fundamentally opposed.

(1 John 2:22) 
Who is the liar, if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ, the Anointed Messiah? This person is an antichrist, one who denies the Father and the Son, thereby rejecting the very nature of God and salvation.

(1 John 2:23) 
Everyone who denies the Son does not also have the Father; you cannot truly know or relate to God the Father without accepting Jesus as His Son. And whoever confesses the Son also has the Father.

(1 John 2:24) 
Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning, the foundational teachings of the faith, remain firmly established in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you also will remain in the Son and in the Father, experiencing intimate communion with the Trinity.

(1 John 2:25) 
And this is the promise which He Himself promised to us, the ultimate gift of eternal life.

(1 John 2:26) 
I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to lead you astray with false teachings.

(1 John 2:27) 
But as for you, the anointing which you received from Him (the indwelling Holy Spirit) let it remain in you. And you do not necessarily need anyone to teach you *everything* in the way of ultimate truth, but just as His anointing teaches you about all things pertaining to salvation and discernment—and this teaching is true and is not a lie—just as it has taught you, abide in Him, remaining steadfast in Christ.

(1 John 2:28) 
And now, dear children, abide in Him, remain firmly united to Christ. Do this so that when He appears in His glorious Second Coming, we may have confidence and not be put to shame or shrink away from Him at His arrival.

(1 John 2:29) 
If you know that He, God Himself, is just and righteous, then know also that everyone who practices righteousness, living in a way that aligns with God's justice, is born of Him, having received a new spiritual birth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:1) 
Consider what great love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God, and truly are His children! Because of this spiritual reality, the world does not understand us, because it never truly understood God the Father or His Son, Jesus Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:2) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, we are already children of God right now! Yet, it has not yet been fully revealed what our glorified state will be. But we do know this: when He—Jesus Christ—appears again in glory, we shall be made like Him, for we shall see Him as He truly is.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:3) 
And everyone who cherishes this hope in Him—in Jesus Christ and His glorious return—purifies himself, just as Christ Himself is perfectly pure.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:4) 
Everyone who commits sin also breaks God’s law, and sin, by its very nature, is a transgression of that divine law.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:5) 
And you know that Jesus Christ appeared to take away our sins, and there is absolutely no sin found in Him.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:6) 
Everyone who truly abides in Him—in Christ—does not continue to live in sin. And everyone who habitually sins has not genuinely seen Him nor truly known Him in a saving way.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:7) 
My dear children, do not let anyone deceive you about this: the one who practices righteousness and lives according to God’s law is righteous, just as Jesus Christ Himself is righteous.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:8) 
The one who habitually practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning since the very beginning of creation. It was for this specific reason that God the Son appeared: to undo and destroy the works of the devil.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:9) 
No one who has been truly born of God continually practices sin, because God's divine life, like a spiritual seed, remains within him. And such a person cannot habitually sin as a lifestyle, because he has been born of God and has a new spiritual nature.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:10) 
By this clear distinction, the children of God and the children of the devil are made evident. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not from God. And likewise, anyone who does not love his Christian brother or sister is not from God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:11) 
For this is the fundamental message that you have heard from the very beginning of your Christian faith: that we should love one another.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:12) 
Do not be like Cain, who was spiritually aligned with the evil one, and murdered his own brother. And why did he murder him? Because Cain’s own deeds were wicked, while his brother Abel’s deeds were righteous in God's sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:13) 
Therefore, do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the ungodly world hates you.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:14) 
We, the faithful, know with certainty that we have passed from spiritual death into spiritual life, because we love our Christian brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains spiritually dead.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:15) 
Everyone who hates his Christian brother or sister is, in God’s sight, a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding within himself.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:16) 
By this supreme act, we have come to understand the depth of God’s love: that He—Jesus Christ—laid down His own life for us. Therefore, we also ought to be willing to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:17) 
But if someone possesses the material resources of this world, and sees his Christian brother or sister in need, yet closes his heart and refuses to help him, how can the love of God truly abide in that person?

(1 John 3:1 John 3:18) 
My dear children, let us not love merely in word or with empty talk, but genuinely, through our actions and with sincere truth.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:19) 
By this practical love, we know that we are truly from the truth, and thus we can reassure our hearts before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:20) 
Because even if our own conscience condemns us, remember that God is greater than our heart and knows all things, including our intentions and efforts, offering mercy.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:21) 
Beloved brothers and sisters, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confident assurance before God.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:22) 
And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we diligently keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:23) 
And this is His foundational commandment: that we believe in the saving name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, just as He commanded us to do.

(1 John 3:1 John 3:24) 
And the one who keeps His commandments remains in God, and God remains in him. And by this we know that God remains in us: by the Holy Spirit whom He has given to us.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:1) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, do not believe every spiritual influence or teaching you encounter, but instead discern whether these spirits and their teachings are truly from God. Many false prophets have emerged and spread throughout the world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:2) 
This is how you can recognize the true Spirit of God: every spiritual teaching that acknowledges Jesus Christ has come into the world as a fully human being, with a real body, truly originates from God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:3) 
And any spiritual teaching that denies the truth about Jesus Christ—specifically that He is truly human and truly divine—does not originate from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have been warned would come, and indeed, it is already at work in the world today.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:4) 
My dear little children, you are from God and have already defeated the spirit of the antichrist and the world's false teachings. This is because the Holy Spirit who lives within you is infinitely greater than the evil spirit who dominates this world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:5) 
Those false prophets and their teachings originate from the world itself. Therefore, their messages are worldly in nature, and the worldly people readily accept and listen to them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:6) 
We, the true apostles and teachers, are from God. Anyone who truly knows and loves God listens to and accepts our teachings. Anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is the clear way we distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:7) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, let us continually love one another, because true, self-sacrificing love originates directly from God. Every person who genuinely loves in this way has been spiritually reborn by God and truly knows Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:8) 
Anyone who does not practice this kind of love does not truly know God, for the very essence and nature of God is love itself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:9) 
In this one supreme act, the immense love of God was made manifest to us: God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, not just for a visit, but so that we might gain spiritual and eternal life through Him.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:10) 
Real love is found in this: it was not that we first loved God, but rather that He loved us first. And because of this profound love, He sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins, to appease His righteous anger and reconcile us to Himself.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:11) 
My dearest brothers and sisters, if God has loved us with such immense love, then we, too, are obligated to love one another in the same sacrificial way.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:12) 
No human being has ever seen God with their physical eyes. However, if we consistently love one another, then God dwells within us, and His love, fully actualized and made complete, is perfected in us through our actions.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:13) 
This is how we come to know with certainty that we remain united with God, and that He remains united with us: because He has graciously given us His Holy Spirit.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:14) 
And we, the apostles, have personally seen Him and bear witness to the truth that God the Father sent His Son as the one and only Savior of the entire world.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:15) 
Whoever openly declares and believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly has God dwelling within them, and they, in turn, dwell in God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:16) 
And we ourselves have come to know, through experience and faith, the profound love that God has for us. God Himself is love. Therefore, anyone who lives and remains in this true love also lives and remains in God, and God lives and remains in them.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:17) 
In this way, God's love is made perfect and complete in us: we can have unwavering confidence on the Day of Judgment. This is because, as Jesus Christ is in His divine and human nature, so also are we, through Him, made to be in this world—righteous and beloved by God.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:18) 
There is no room for cringing fear in divine love. Instead, perfect and mature love expels all such fear, because fear inherently involves the expectation of punishment. Anyone who still lives in this kind of fear has not yet been made perfect and complete in their understanding and practice of divine love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:19) 
Therefore, let us eagerly love God, because He first loved us with an initiating and boundless love.

(1 John 4:1 John 4:20) 
If someone claims, "I love God," yet at the same time harbors hatred for his brother or sister in Christ, that person is a liar. For how can anyone truly love God, whom they have not seen, if they do not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen and interact with daily?

(1 John 4:1 John 4:21) 
And indeed, this is the explicit commandment we have received from God Himself: that whoever loves God must also love his brother or sister in Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:1) 
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Anointed One, the Christ, has been spiritually born of God. And everyone who loves the Father, who is the source of this new birth, also loves all others who are born of Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:2) 
By this sign we know that we truly love the children of God: when we love God ourselves and obey His commandments.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:3) 
For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome or impossible to keep.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:4) 
For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world: our faith in Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:5) 
Who is it, then, who overcomes the world? It is only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God, truly God from God.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:6) 
This is Jesus Christ, who came to us through the waters of Baptism and the shedding of His blood on the Cross. He did not come to us by water alone, but by water and blood together. And it is the Holy Spirit who bears witness that Christ is the Truth Himself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:7) 
For there are three witnesses who bear testimony in Heaven: the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And these three are one in their divine essence and nature.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:8) 
And there are three witnesses who bear testimony on earth: the Holy Spirit, the water of Baptism, and the blood of the Eucharist and His Passion. And these three also bear a unified witness.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:9) 
If we accept the testimony of men in earthly courts, the testimony of God is far greater and more authoritative. For this is God’s testimony, which is the greater, because He Himself has borne witness concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:10) 
Whoever believes in God the Son carries the testimony of God within himself, imprinted upon his soul. Whoever does not believe in God the Son makes God out to be a liar and rejects His divine truth, because he does not believe the testimony that God Himself has borne concerning His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:11) 
And this is the central truth of that testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this eternal life is found fully in His Son.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:12) 
Whoever possesses God the Son, through faith and grace, also possesses this eternal life. Whoever does not possess God the Son does not have this eternal life, for it can only be found in Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:13) 
I am writing these things to you so that you may know with certainty that you possess eternal life, you who believe in the Name of God the Son, which is Jesus Christ.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:14) 
And this is the confident assurance that we have in Him, God Himself: that if we ask anything according to His divine will, He hears and grants our prayer.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:15) 
And since we know that He hears us in whatever we ask in accordance with His will, we also know that we have already been granted the petitions we have asked from Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:16) 
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to spiritual death, he should pray for him, and God will grant life to that sinner who has not sinned unto death. There is, however, a sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin. I do not say that one should pray for that kind of sin in the same way, as it requires deeper repentance.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:17) 
Every unrighteous act is a sin against God. But there is a specific type of sin that leads to spiritual death, a mortal sin.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:18) 
We know that everyone who has been born of God does not habitually or mortally sin, for the Son of God Himself, being truly born of God, keeps Himself free from sin, and the Evil One cannot grasp Him.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:19) 
We know that we are truly from God, yet the whole world around us lies under the power and influence of the Evil One.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:20) 
And we know with certainty that God the Son has come into the world, and He has given us the spiritual understanding to know the true God, so that we may truly be united with His true Son, Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the true God, and He is eternal life itself.

(1 John 5:1 John 5:21) 
Little children, guard yourselves from idols and false gods. Amen.
