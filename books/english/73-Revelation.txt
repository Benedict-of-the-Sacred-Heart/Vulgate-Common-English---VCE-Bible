(Revelation 1:1) 
This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God the Father gave to God the Son, so that He could make known to His servants what must quickly happen. And God the Son made it known by sending His Angel to His servant John.

(Revelation 1:2) 
John bore witness to the Word of God—the Son, Jesus Christ—and to everything he saw.

(Revelation 1:3) 
Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things written in it. For the time is near for these things to unfold.

(Revelation 1:4) 
John writes to the seven churches that are in Asia. May grace and peace be with you from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Eternal Father, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.

(Revelation 1:5) 
And may grace and peace be with you from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful Witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth. He loved us and washed us from our sins in His own Blood.

(Revelation 1:6) 
And He made us a kingdom of priests for God, His Father. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

(Revelation 1:7) 
Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him—even those who pierced Him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. Yes, truly, Amen.

(Revelation 1:8) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the Beginning and the End—the One who is, and who was, and who is to come—the Almighty."

(Revelation 1:9) 
I, John, your brother and companion in the tribulation, and in the kingdom, and in the patient endurance of Jesus Christ, was on the island called Patmos because of the Word of God—the Son, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.

(Revelation 1:10) 
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the sound of a trumpet.

(Revelation 1:11) 
The voice said: "Write what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches that are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."

(Revelation 1:12) 
I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.

(Revelation 1:13) 
And in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to His feet, and girded at the chest with a golden sash.

(Revelation 1:14) 
His head and His hair were white, like white wool or like snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire.

(Revelation 1:15) 
His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters—a mighty roar.

(Revelation 1:16) 
He held seven stars in His right hand. From His mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and His face shone like the sun in its full strength.

(Revelation 1:17) 
When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand upon me, saying: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last."

(Revelation 1:18) 
"I am the Living One. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys of death and of hell."

(Revelation 1:19) 
"Therefore, write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these."

(Revelation 1:20) 
"The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands is this: the seven stars are the Angels—the spiritual guardians—of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches themselves."

(Revelation 2:2:1) 
Write to the angel of the Church at Ephesus. Here are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand—the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, which are the seven Churches.

(Revelation 2:2:2) 
I know all that you do. I know your hard work and your patient endurance. And I know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who falsely claim to be apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.

(Revelation 2:2:3) 
You have also persevered patiently, and you have endured hardship for My Name’s sake without growing weary or giving up.

(Revelation 2:2:4) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: you have abandoned the fervent love you had for Me at first.

(Revelation 2:2:5) 
Remember the spiritual heights from which you have fallen. Repent and return to doing the good works you did at the beginning of your faith. If you do not repent and change your ways, I will come to you swiftly and remove your lampstand from its place, meaning your Church itself could lose its existence or purpose.

(Revelation 2:2:6) 
But I do commend you for this: you utterly hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

(Revelation 2:2:7) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will grant the right to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the paradise of My God.

(Revelation 2:2:8) 
And to the angel of the Church at Smyrna, write these words: Here are the words of the First and the Last, who was dead and now lives.

(Revelation 2:2:9) 
I know your suffering and persecution, and I know your material poverty. But you are spiritually rich. I also know the slander and blasphemies from those who claim to be Jews but are not truly God’s people. Instead, they are a synagogue of Satan.

(Revelation 2:2:10) 
Do not be afraid of any of the suffering you are about to face. Listen! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested and tried. And you will suffer for a limited period of ten days. Remain faithful and steadfast, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of eternal life.

(Revelation 2:2:11) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. The one who overcomes and remains faithful will not be harmed by the second death.

(Revelation 2:2:12) 
And to the angel of the Church at Pergamum, write these words: Here are the words of the One who has the sharp, two-edged sword.

(Revelation 2:2:13) 
I know where you live, in the very city where Satan’s throne is located. Yet, you hold fast to My Name and have not denied your faith in Me. Even in those difficult days, when Antipas, My faithful witness, was martyred among you, right there where Satan dwells.

(Revelation 2:2:14) 
Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You tolerate some among you who cling to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites into sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.

(Revelation 2:2:15) 
Similarly, you also have those who cling to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

(Revelation 2:2:16) 
Therefore, repent of these things and change your ways. Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and I will wage war against them with the sword of My mouth.

(Revelation 2:2:17) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches. To the one who overcomes and remains faithful, I will give some of the hidden manna to eat, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and eternal life. I will also give that person a white stone, a symbol of acquittal and honor, and on that stone, a new name will be written, which no one knows except the one who receives it, signifying a unique relationship with Me.

(Revelation 2:2:18) 
And to the angel of the Church at Thyatira, write these words: Here are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze, glowing as if refined in a furnace.

(Revelation 2:2:19) 
I know all that you do. I know your faith, your love, your service to others, and your patient endurance. Indeed, your more recent works are even greater than those you did at first.

(Revelation 2:2:20) 
Yet, I have a few things against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and through her teaching, she misleads My servants into committing sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols.

(Revelation 2:2:21) 
I gave her time to repent and change her ways, but she refuses to repent of her immoral behavior.

(Revelation 2:2:22) 
Listen! I will cast her onto a bed of suffering and sickness. And those who commit adultery with her will be plunged into intense suffering and great tribulation, unless they repent of the evil works they learned from her.

(Revelation 2:2:23) 
I will also strike her followers with death. Then all the Churches will know that I am the One who searches the innermost thoughts and desires, as well as the intentions of the heart. And I will give to each one of you exactly what your works deserve.

(Revelation 2:2:24) 
But to the rest of you in Thyatira, to all who do not hold to this false teaching, and who have not learned what some call the 'deep secrets' of Satan—I tell you: I will not lay any other burden upon you.

(Revelation 2:2:25) 
Only hold firmly to the truth you already have until I come again.

(Revelation 2:2:26) 
To the one who overcomes and remains faithful to My works until the very end, I will give that person authority over the nations.

(Revelation 2:2:27) 
That person will rule them with a rod of iron, and they will be shattered like earthenware vessels.

(Revelation 2:2:28) 
—just as I Myself have received this authority from My Father. And I will also give that person the Morning Star, which is Myself, symbolizing a share in My glory and rule.

(Revelation 2:2:29) 
Let anyone who has ears to hear understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.

(Revelation 3:3:1) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Sardis, write these words: 'These are the words of Him who possesses the seven Spirits of God—that is, the Holy Spirit in all His fullness—and the seven stars, who are the bishops of the Churches. I know all your deeds. You have the reputation among men of being spiritually alive, but in reality, you are spiritually dead.'

(Revelation 3:3:2) 
'Wake up and be watchful! And strengthen the remaining good that is still alive within you, for it is on the verge of dying completely. For I have not found your deeds to be complete or perfect in the eyes of My God.'

(Revelation 3:3:3) 
'Therefore, remember the pure teaching you received from the Apostles and how you first heard it. Hold fast to it, and repent of your spiritual slumber. If you do not wake up and remain watchful, I will come upon you suddenly, like a thief in the night, and you will not know the hour of My coming to judge you.'

(Revelation 3:3:4) 
'But there are a few people in Sardis who have not stained their garments with sin. These few will walk with Me in white robes, for they are worthy of this honor, having kept their purity.'

(Revelation 3:3:5) 
'The one who overcomes these spiritual trials will similarly be clothed in white garments, signifying their purity and victory. I will certainly not erase their name from the Book of Life, which records those who are destined for eternal salvation. And I will publicly acknowledge and declare their name before My Father and before His holy angels.'

(Revelation 3:3:6) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:7) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Philadelphia, write these words: 'These are the words of the Holy One, who is absolutely true, and who holds the key of David—the ultimate authority over the Kingdom of God, the Church. What He opens, no one can shut; and what He shuts, no one can open, for He has absolute power over all things.'

(Revelation 3:3:8) 
'I know all your deeds. Behold, I have placed before you an open door for ministry and evangelism, and no one has the power to shut it. I have done this because you possess little worldly strength, yet you have kept My word faithfully and have never denied My name.'

(Revelation 3:3:9) 
'Behold, I will deliver into your hands those from the synagogue of Satan—those who falsely claim to be true Jews, God's chosen people, but are liars. Behold, I will make them come and prostrate themselves before your feet, showing their submission to you. This will happen so that they will know that I, Jesus Christ, have truly loved you.'

(Revelation 3:3:10) 
'Because you have faithfully kept My command to endure with patience, I, in turn, will keep you safe during the coming hour of temptation—a time of severe trial which is about to come upon the entire world to test all who dwell on the earth.'

(Revelation 3:3:11) 
'Behold, I am coming soon! Hold fast to the faith and good works you possess, so that no one may take away the crown of eternal life and glory that awaits you.'

(Revelation 3:3:12) 
'The one who overcomes will I make a steadfast pillar in the eternal temple of My God, and they shall never again have to leave it. I will inscribe upon them the very name of My God, and the name of the city of My God—the New Jerusalem, which descends from the sky, from My God Himself—and also My own new name. This signifies their permanent place, their divine ownership, and their intimate communion.'

(Revelation 3:3:13) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 3:3:14) 
And to the bishop of the Church in Laodicea, write these words: 'These are the words of the Amen—that is, the Divine Truth Himself—the faithful and true witness to God's plan, who is the source and ruler of all God's creation, not a created being Himself.'

(Revelation 3:3:15) 
'I know all your deeds, and you are neither spiritually cold nor spiritually hot. Oh, how I wish you were either truly cold, openly rejecting Me, or truly hot, fervently zealous for Me!'

(Revelation 3:3:16) 
'But because you are lukewarm—neither truly cold nor truly hot—just like the nauseating, tepid water, I am about to spit you out of My mouth.'

(Revelation 3:3:17) 
'Because you boastfully declare, "I am rich and have acquired great wealth, and I am in need of nothing!"—yet you do not realize that in My sight, you are truly wretched, pitiable, spiritually poor, blind to truth, and naked of spiritual virtue.'

(Revelation 3:3:18) 
'Therefore, I advise you to come and 'buy' from Me gold purified by fire, so that you may become truly rich in faith and good works. Also, 'buy' white garments from Me, so that you may clothe yourself and cover the shameful nakedness of your sins. And 'buy' eye salve from Me, to anoint your eyes so that you may regain your spiritual sight and truly understand.'

(Revelation 3:3:19) 
'All those whom I truly love, I rebuke and discipline for their own good. Therefore, be zealous in your faith and promptly repent of your lukewarmness.'

(Revelation 3:3:20) 
'Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door to Me, I will come in to them, and I will share a meal with them in intimate communion, and they with Me.'

(Revelation 3:3:21) 
'The one who overcomes will I grant the privilege to sit with Me on My throne, sharing in My royal authority—just as I Myself overcame the world and then sat down with My Father on His throne.'

(Revelation 3:3:22) 
'He who has an ear, let him understand and pay close attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying to all the Churches.'

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:1) 
After these events, I looked, and behold, a door stood open in Heaven. Then I heard the first voice I had heard before—a voice like a trumpet speaking to me. It said, "Come up here! And I will show you what must happen after these things."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:2) 
Immediately, I was transported in spirit, and behold, there was a throne set in Heaven, and upon the throne, Someone was seated.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:3) 
The One seated there looked like jasper and sardine stones. And around the throne, there was a rainbow, looking like an emerald.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:4) 
Around that throne were twenty-four smaller thrones, and on these twenty-four thrones sat twenty-four elders. They were clothed in white robes, and on their heads were crowns of gold.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:5) 
From the throne came flashes of lightning, voices, and peals of thunder. And seven burning lamps were before the throne, which represent the seven Spirits of God—the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:6) 
And before the throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. And in the center of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:7) 
The first living creature was like a lion. The second living creature was like a young bull. The third living creature had a face like that of a man. And the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight.

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:8) 
Each of the four living creatures had six wings. They were full of eyes all around and within. They never ceased, day or night, saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, He who was, and who is, and who is to come."

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:9) 
And whenever those living creatures gave glory, and honor, and blessing to the One seated on the throne—to Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever—

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:10) 
the twenty-four elders would fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship Him who lives for all ages, forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, declaring:

(Revelation 4:Revelation 4:11) 
"You are worthy, Our Lord and Our God, to receive glory, and honor, and power. Because You created all things, and by Your will, they existed and were created."

(Revelation 5:1) 
And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne a scroll. This scroll was written on both its inner and outer surfaces, and it was sealed with seven seals.

(Revelation 5:2) 
And I saw a mighty angel. He was proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open this scroll and break its seals?"

(Revelation 5:3) 
And no one in the universe, nor on the earth, nor in the underworld, was able to open the scroll or even to look at it.

(Revelation 5:4) 
And I began to weep profusely because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or even to examine it.

(Revelation 5:5) 
And one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah—the promised descendant of David who is the Root and source of David's royal line—He has conquered. He is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seven seals."

(Revelation 5:6) 
And I looked, and behold, in the center, between the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb. This Lamb appeared as if it had been slain, bearing the marks of sacrifice. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven Spirits of God sent throughout the entire earth.

(Revelation 5:7) 
And the Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat upon the throne.

(Revelation 5:8) 
And when the Lamb was about to open the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before Him. Each of them had a harp and a golden bowl full of incense; these bowls contain the prayers of the saints.

(Revelation 5:9) 
And they sang a new song, declaring, "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive the scroll and to open its seals. For you were slain, and by your precious blood, you have ransomed us for God—rescuing people from every tribe, language, nation, and people group."

(Revelation 5:10) 
You have made us into a kingdom and priests for our God, and we shall reign over the earth.

(Revelation 5:11) 
And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels encircling the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. Their number was countless—millions upon millions.

(Revelation 5:12) 
They were saying with a loud voice, "The Lamb who was slain is worthy to receive all power, and divine authority, and perfect wisdom, and immense strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!"

(Revelation 5:13) 
And I heard every creature in the entire universe—those in the sky, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea—every single one of them, saying: "To Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion forever and ever!"

(Revelation 5:14) 
And the four living creatures were saying, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down on their faces and adored Him who lives forever and ever.

(Revelation 6:1) 
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures speak with a voice like thunder, saying: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:2) 
And I looked, and behold, a white horse appeared. He who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went forth conquering, and to conquer all things.

(Revelation 6:3) 
And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:4) 
And another horse went out, a red one. It was given to him who sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that people would kill one another. A great sword was also given to him.

(Revelation 6:5) 
And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come, and see.” And behold, a black horse appeared, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.

(Revelation 6:6) 
And I heard a voice, as it were, from the midst of the four living creatures, saying: “A measure of wheat will cost a denarius, and three measures of barley will cost a denarius, but do not harm the wine and the oil.”

(Revelation 6:7) 
And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come, and see.”

(Revelation 6:8) 
And behold, a pale horse appeared, and he who sat upon it was named Death, and the realm of the dead followed closely with him. Power was given to him over a fourth part of the earth, to kill by the sword, and by famine, and by plagues, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

(Revelation 6:9) 
And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony of faith they had always held.

(Revelation 6:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: “How long, O holy and true Lord, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who live on the earth?”

(Revelation 6:11) 
And white robes were given to each of them, and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and their brethren are complete—those who are also to be killed, just as they were.

(Revelation 6:12) 
And I saw when He had opened the sixth seal, and behold, a great earthquake happened, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the entire moon became like blood.

(Revelation 6:13) 
And the stars from the sky fell upon the earth, just as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.

(Revelation 6:14) 
And the sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

(Revelation 6:15) 
And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the military commanders, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave and every free person hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.

(Revelation 6:16) 
And they said to the mountains and to the rocks: “Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.”

(Revelation 6:17) 
For the great day of their wrath has come, and who will be able to stand against it?”

(Revelation 7:7:1) 
After these visions, I saw four Angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.

(Revelation 7:7:2) 
Then I saw another Angel coming up from the direction of the rising sun. This Angel had the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four Angels who had been given the power to harm the earth and the sea.

(Revelation 7:7:3) 
He told them: "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God."

(Revelation 7:7:4) 
And I heard the total number of those who were sealed: 144,000 people were sealed, from every tribe of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 7:7:5) 
From the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Gad, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:6) 
From the tribe of Asher, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:7) 
From the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Levi, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Issachar, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:8) 
From the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 were sealed. From the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.

(Revelation 7:7:9) 
After these things, I saw a great multitude that no one could count. They came from every nation, and from all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They were standing before the throne of God and in the presence of the Lamb of God, clothed in shining white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.

(Revelation 7:7:10) 
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation comes from our God, who sits upon the throne, and from the Lamb!"

(Revelation 7:7:11) 
And all the Angels were standing around the throne, and around the Elders, and the four living creatures. They all fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God.

(Revelation 7:7:12) 
saying: "Amen! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, and power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"

(Revelation 7:7:13) 
Then one of the Elders spoke to me, asking: "Who are these people who are clothed in shining white robes? And where did they come from?"

(Revelation 7:7:14) 
And I said to him: "My Lord, you are the one who knows." And he said to me: "These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white by the blood of the Lamb."

(Revelation 7:7:15) 
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple. And the One who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle of protection over them.

(Revelation 7:7:16) 
They will never be hungry again, and they will never be thirsty again. Neither will the sun beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.

(Revelation 7:7:17) 
For the Lamb, who is at the very center of the throne, will be their Shepherd. He will lead them to the springs of the waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

(Revelation 8:8:1) 
And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was a solemn silence in the spiritual realm of heaven, lasting for about half an hour.

(Revelation 8:8:2) 
I then saw seven angels standing before the very presence of God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

(Revelation 8:8:3) 
Another angel then came and stood before the heavenly altar, holding a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it along with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that stands before God’s throne.

(Revelation 8:8:4) 
And the smoke of the incense, carrying the prayers of God's holy people, ascended from the angel's hand into the presence of God.

(Revelation 8:8:5) 
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw the fire down onto the earth. At once, there were great peals of thunder, roaring voices, flashes of lightning, and a mighty earthquake.

(Revelation 8:8:6) 
And the seven angels, who held the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to blow them.

(Revelation 8:8:7) 
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, which was then cast down onto the earth. As a result, one-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was completely consumed by fire.

(Revelation 8:8:8) 
Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a massive mountain, blazing with fire, was hurled into the sea. One-third of the sea then turned into blood.

(Revelation 8:8:9) 
One-third of all the living creatures in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships were destroyed.

(Revelation 8:8:10) 
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, burning like a blazing torch, fell from the sky. It landed upon one-third of the rivers and the springs of water.

(Revelation 8:8:11) 
The name of the star is called "Wormwood," referring to its bitter effect. And one-third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood, and many people died from drinking these waters because they had become so bitter.

(Revelation 8:8:12) 
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars. Consequently, one-third of their light was darkened, so that one-third of the day had no light, and similarly, one-third of the night was also dark.

(Revelation 8:8:13) 
I then looked and heard an eagle flying in the middle of the sky, crying out with a loud voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts of the three angels who are still about to sound their trumpets!"

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:1) 
The fifth angel then blew his trumpet. I then saw a star—a heavenly being—fall from the sky and land on the earth. This fallen star was given a key to unlock the bottomless pit of the abyss.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:2) 
He opened the bottomless pit, and a vast amount of smoke rose from the pit, like the smoke from a massive furnace. The sun and the very air itself were both darkened by this smoke that came from the pit.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:3) 
Then, from the smoke, swarms of these locust-like creatures emerged and spread across the earth. They were given a destructive power, similar to the power that earthly scorpions have when they sting.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:4) 
They were explicitly commanded not to harm any vegetation—not the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree. Their only target was to be those people who did not have the mark of God on their foreheads.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:5) 
These creatures were not allowed to kill their victims. Instead, they were permitted to inflict torment upon them for a period of five months. The pain they caused was as severe as the excruciating pain a person feels when stung by a scorpion.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:6) 
During that time of suffering, people will desperately search for death, yet they will not be able to find it. They will long to die, but death itself will evade them and keep them alive to suffer.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:7) 
The appearance of these locust-like creatures was like horses equipped for battle. On their heads, they seemed to wear something like crowns made of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:8) 
They had hair that looked like women's hair, and their teeth were as sharp and strong as the teeth of lions.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:9) 
They were protected by breastplates that seemed to be made of iron. The sound of their wings was as deafening as the noise of many chariots pulled by numerous horses charging into battle.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:10) 
These creatures possessed tails similar to those of scorpions, and their tails contained deadly stings. Their power to inflict harm on people was limited to five months.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:11) 
These creatures had a king ruling over them—the angel of the bottomless pit. In Hebrew, his name is Abaddon, which means "destruction." In Greek, his name is Apollyon, also meaning "destroyer," and in Latin, his name is Exterminans, meaning "Exterminator."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:12) 
The first "woe"—a period of intense suffering—has now concluded. But observe, two more such periods of woe are still coming after this.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:13) 
Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a single voice speaking from the four horns of the golden altar that stands before the very presence of God. This voice commanded the sixth angel, who held the trumpet, saying, "Release the four angels who are held bound at the great river Euphrates."

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:14) 
So the four angels were released. They had been precisely prepared for this specific hour, day, month, and year, to carry out their mission: to kill one-third of all humankind.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:15) 
The number of the army of horsemen was an enormous two hundred million. I personally heard their exact number stated.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:16) 
And this is how I saw the horses in the vision: their riders wore breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfur-yellow. The horses' heads resembled the heads of lions, and from their mouths issued fire, smoke, and sulfur.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:17) 
It was by these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that erupted from the mouths of the horses—that one-third of all humanity was killed.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:18) 
Indeed, their destructive power resides in both their mouths and their tails. Their tails are like venomous serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:19) 
Indeed, their tails are like serpents, each having its own head, and it is with these serpent-like tails that they inflict harm.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:20) 
Despite these devastating plagues, the rest of humanity who were not killed still did not repent of the evil deeds they had done with their own hands. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—lifeless objects that can neither see, hear, nor walk.

(Revelation 9:Revelation 9:21) 
They did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries and use of poisons, nor of their sexual immoralities, nor of their thefts.

(Revelation 10:1) 
Then I saw another powerful angel descending from the sky, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.

(Revelation 10:2) 
In his hand, he held an open scroll. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.

(Revelation 10:3) 
And he cried out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he had cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.

(Revelation 10:4) 
And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices, I was about to write them down. But I heard a voice from the sky telling me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; do not write them."

(Revelation 10:5) 
Then the angel whom I saw standing over the sea and over the land raised his hand to the sky.

(Revelation 10:6) 
And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the universe and all the things that are within it, and the land and all the things that are on it, and the sea and all the things that are within it: that there would be no more delay.

(Revelation 10:7) 
But in the days when the seventh angel will sound his trumpet, when he begins to sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be completed, just as He announced through His servants, the prophets.

(Revelation 10:8) 
And I heard the voice from the sky speaking with me again, and it said, "Go, take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing over the sea and over the land."

(Revelation 10:9) 
So I went to the angel, asking him to give me the scroll. And he said to me, "Take it, and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth, it will be as sweet as honey."

(Revelation 10:10) 
And I took the scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. And in my mouth, it was as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.

(Revelation 10:11) 
And the angel said to me, "You must prophesy again to many peoples, and nations, and languages, and kings."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:1) 
And I was given a measuring rod, much like a staff, with a voice saying: "Rise up, and measure God's true Temple, and the Altar, and those who genuinely worship within it."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:2) 
But the outer court, the part of the Temple that is outside, do not measure that; instead, leave it out. For it has been given over to the non-believers, who will trample upon the holy city for forty-two months—a specific period of persecution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:3) 
And I will give great power to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days—which is the same forty-two months—clothed in sackcloth as a sign of penance and mourning.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:4) 
These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing in the very presence of the Lord who rules the earth, continuously supplied with divine grace and light.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:5) 
And if anyone desires to harm them, divine judgment, like fire, will come out of their mouths and consume their enemies. Indeed, if anyone tries to harm them, they must be killed by this means of divine retribution.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:6) 
These witnesses have the divine power to shut up the sky, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire—just like Moses and Elijah.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:7) 
And when they have finished their testimony and their prophetic mission, the Beast that ascends from the abyss—a demonic, anti-Christ power—will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:8) 
And their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom for its wickedness and Egypt for its oppression, the very place where their Lord was crucified, representing the world's rejection of God.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:9) 
And people from every tribe, nation, language, and Gentile group will gaze upon their unburied bodies for three and a half days, and they will not allow their bodies to be placed in tombs, denying them a dignified burial.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:10) 
And those who inhabit the earth will rejoice over their deaths and celebrate loudly. They will even send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented all those who lived on the earth with their calls to repentance and their divine judgments.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:11) 
But after the three and a half days, the very breath of life from God entered into them. And they stood upright on their feet, and tremendous fear gripped everyone who saw this miraculous resurrection.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:12) 
Then they heard a loud voice from the sky telling them, "Come up here!" And they ascended into the sky, carried up in clouds, while their enemies watched them and saw their divine vindication.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:13) 
At that very moment, a great earthquake struck, causing a tenth of the symbolic city to collapse. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors, overcome by terror, gave glory to the God who rules over the sky.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:14) 
The second judgment-woe has passed, and watch closely—the third and final judgment-woe is about to come quickly.

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:15) 
And the seventh Angel blew his trumpet. Then, loud voices rang out through the universe, declaring: "The kingdom of this world has now become the eternal kingdom of Our Lord and His Anointed One, and He shall reign over all of it forever and ever!"

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:16) 
And the twenty-four elders, who were always seated before God on their thrones, fell prostrate on their faces and worshipped God, saying:

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:17) 
"We give You thanks, Lord God Almighty, Who always is, and Who always was, and Who is always to come—because You have now taken up Your tremendous power and have begun Your eternal reign."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:18) 
"The nations raged against You, but Your righteous wrath has now come. It is the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and for You to give rewards to Your servants—the prophets and the saints, and to all who revere Your Name, from the least important to the greatest. And it is time for You to utterly destroy those who corrupted the earth."

(Revelation 11:Revelation 11:19) 
Then the very Temple of God in the universe was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was plainly seen inside His Temple. This revelation was accompanied by flashes of lightning, loud rumblings, thunderclaps, a great earthquake, and massive hailstones falling, signifying divine presence and judgment.

(Revelation 12:1) 
Then a great sign appeared in the sky: A woman was clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars, representing the twelve Apostles and the fullness of the Church.

(Revelation 12:2) 
She was pregnant and cried out in the pain of childbirth, referring to the Virgin Mary giving birth to Christ, and the Church laboring to bring Christ to the world.

(Revelation 12:3) 
Then another sign was seen in the sky: And behold, a great red dragon appeared. It had seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven royal crowns, signifying the vast power and dominion of Satan, the Adversary.

(Revelation 12:4) 
Its tail swept down a third of the stars from the sky and cast them to the earth, representing the fallen angels who rebelled with Satan. The Dragon then stood before the Woman who was about to give birth, so that when she delivered, he might devour her Son, referencing Satan's attempts to destroy Christ.

(Revelation 12:5) 
And she gave birth to a Son, a male child, who is destined to rule all nations with an iron scepter. Her Son, Jesus Christ, was immediately caught up to God and to His throne, signifying His Ascension and divine rule.

(Revelation 12:6) 
The Woman then fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that she might be nourished there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, symbolizing the Church's period of persecution and divine protection.

(Revelation 12:7) 
And a great battle took place in the sky: Michael, the Archangel, and his angels fought against the Dragon. And the Dragon and his angels fought back.

(Revelation 12:8) 
But they were not strong enough, and their place was found no more in the heavens, as Satan and his demons were utterly defeated and cast out.

(Revelation 12:9) 
So the great Dragon was cast down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.

(Revelation 12:10) 
And I heard a loud voice in the sky saying: 'Now salvation has come, and strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ! Because the accuser of our brothers, who accused them before the sight of our God day and night, has been cast down!'

(Revelation 12:11) 
And they overcame him because of the Blood of the Lamb, which is Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and because of the word of their testimony to the truth, and they did not love their lives even to the point of death, showing their ultimate fidelity.

(Revelation 12:12) 
Therefore, rejoice, O skies, and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and to the sea, for the Devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time left for his evil work!

(Revelation 12:13) 
And after the Dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he persecuted the Woman, who had given birth to the male child, redirecting his wrath against the Church.

(Revelation 12:14) 
And to the Woman were given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent, signifying God's divine protection of the Church.

(Revelation 12:15) 
And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the Woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be swept away by the current, representing various destructive forces like heresy or persecution aimed at overwhelming the Church.

(Revelation 12:16) 
But the earth helped the Woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the Dragon had cast out of his mouth, showing how divine providence often uses earthly means to protect the Church.

(Revelation 12:17) 
And the Dragon was enraged with the Woman, and he went to wage war with the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifying Satan's ongoing war against individual believers and the faithful remnant of the Church.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:1) 
And I saw a beast rise up from the depths of the sea, and this beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten crowns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:2) 
The beast I saw was like a leopard in body, but its feet were like a bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The Dragon—Satan himself—gave this beast its power, its throne, and its great authority.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:3) 
One of its heads appeared to have suffered a mortal wound, as if it had been killed, but its deadly wound was healed. The entire world was astonished by this beast and followed it in wonder.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:4) 
And they worshipped the Dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast. They also worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? And who is able to wage war against it?"

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:5) 
The beast was given a mouth that spoke arrogant boasts and blasphemies against God. And it was given authority to exercise its power for forty-two months.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:6) 
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His holy name, His sacred dwelling place, and those who dwell in the spiritual realm with Him.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:7) 
It was also granted to the beast to make war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation on earth.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:8) 
All who live on the earth will worship it—everyone whose name has not been written from the very beginning of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb, who was slain for the sins of humanity.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:9) 
If anyone has ears to hear this truth, let him pay attention.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:10) 
Whoever is destined for captivity will go into captivity; and whoever is to be killed by the sword must be killed by the sword. This calls for the perseverance and the steadfast faith of God's holy people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:11) 
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke with the voice of the Dragon.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:12) 
This second beast exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it forced the earth and all its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound had been healed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:13) 
It performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from the sky to the earth in the plain sight of all people.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:14) 
It deceived those who dwell on the earth through the signs it was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast. It ordered the inhabitants of the earth to make an image in honor of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:15) 
The second beast was then allowed to give life to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and could cause all who refused to worship the image of the beast to be killed.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:16) 
It also forced all people, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a distinguishing mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:17) 
No one was allowed to buy or sell anything unless they had this mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing its name.

(Revelation 13:Revelation 13:18) 
Here is wisdom. Let anyone with true understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number. That number is six hundred sixty-six.

(Revelation 14:1) 
And I saw: and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion. With Him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.

(Revelation 14:2) 
And I heard a voice from the sky, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The voice I heard was also like harpers playing on their harps.

(Revelation 14:3) 
And they were singing what seemed to be a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn that song except those one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed and purchased from the earth.

(Revelation 14:4) 
These are those who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were purchased from among humanity as the firstfruits for God and for the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:5) 
And in their mouth no lie was found. For they are without blemish, standing before the throne of God.

(Revelation 14:6) 
And I saw another Angel flying through the middle of the sky, having an eternal Gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people.

(Revelation 14:7) 
Saying with a loud voice: 'Fear the Lord and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. And worship Him who made the sky and the earth, the sea and the springs of water.'

(Revelation 14:8) 
And another Angel followed, saying: 'Fallen, fallen is that great Babylon! She who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.'

(Revelation 14:9) 
And a third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: 'If anyone worships the Beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,'

(Revelation 14:10) 
that person will also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath. And he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb.

(Revelation 14:11) 
And the smoke of their torments will ascend forever and ever. They have no rest day or night, those who worshipped the Beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.

(Revelation 14:12) 
Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

(Revelation 14:13) 
And I heard a voice from the sky saying to me: 'Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time forward.' The Spirit says that they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.

(Revelation 14:14) 
And I saw: and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:15) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud: 'Send Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe and withered.'

(Revelation 14:16) 
And the One who was seated on the cloud sent His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was reaped.

(Revelation 14:17) 
And another Angel came out of the Temple that is in the spiritual realm, also having a sharp sickle.

(Revelation 14:18) 
And another Angel came out from the altar, having authority over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: 'Send your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth's vine, for its grapes are fully ripe.'

(Revelation 14:19) 
And the Angel sent his sickle onto the earth, and harvested the vine of the earth, and threw the grapes into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

(Revelation 14:20) 
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress up to the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.

(Revelation 15:1) 
Then I saw another great and amazing sign in the heavenly realm: it was seven angels holding the seven final plagues, because in these plagues, the wrath of God is brought to its ultimate completion.

(Revelation 15:2) 
And I saw something that looked like a sea of glass, mixed with fire. Standing upon this fiery glass sea were those who had triumphed over the beast, and its image, and the number of its name. They were holding harps, given by God.

(Revelation 15:3) 
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They declared: "Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty. Your ways are just and true, O King of the ages, the Lord who reigns through all time."

(Revelation 15:4) 
"Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy and righteous. Indeed, all the nations will come and worship before Your presence, because Your righteous judgments have been made known to all."

(Revelation 15:5) 
And after these things, I looked again, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in the heavenly realm was opened.

(Revelation 15:6) 
And the seven angels came out from the temple, holding the seven plagues. They were clothed with pure and bright stone, shimmering with divine radiance, and girded around their chests with golden sashes.

(Revelation 15:7) 
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels golden bowls, filled to the brim with the wrath of God, the God who lives forever and ever, throughout all ages.

(Revelation 15:8) 
And the temple was filled with smoke, emanating from the majesty of God and from His immense power. And no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fully completed.

(Revelation 16:16:1) 
And I heard a loud voice coming from the Temple. It said to the seven angels: 'Go now, and pour out the seven bowls of God's righteous wrath upon the earth.'

(Revelation 16:16:2) 
So the first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the land. Then a painful and malignant ulcer—a festering sore—appeared on those people who had the mark of the Beast and who worshiped its image.

(Revelation 16:16:3) 
Then the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea. And the sea became like the blood of a dead person—thick and congealed. Every living creature in the sea died because of this.

(Revelation 16:16:4) 
Next, the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water. And they also turned into blood.

(Revelation 16:16:5) 
Then I heard the angel who was responsible for the waters say: 'You are just, O Lord, who exist always, and who always were holy, because You have issued these judgments.'

(Revelation 16:16:6) 
'Because they poured out the blood of Your holy ones and Your prophets, You have given them blood to drink in return. For they deserve this punishment.'

(Revelation 16:16:7) 
And I heard another voice coming from the altar, saying: 'Yes, Lord God Almighty! Your judgments are truthful and righteous!'

(Revelation 16:16:8) 
Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun. And power was given to the sun to scorch people with its intense heat and fire.

(Revelation 16:16:9) 
People were scorched by this extreme heat. Yet they cursed the Name of God—who has authority over these plagues—and they refused to repent and give Him glory.

(Revelation 16:16:10) 
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast. Immediately, its kingdom became consumed by darkness, and people bit their tongues in agonizing pain.

(Revelation 16:16:11) 
They cursed the God of the heavens because of their pains and their sores. Yet they did not repent of their wicked deeds.

(Revelation 16:16:12) 
Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great Euphrates River. And its water dried up, so that a way might be prepared for the kings who come from the rising of the sun—from the East.

(Revelation 16:16:13) 
And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

(Revelation 16:16:14) 
For these are spirits of demons, performing miraculous signs. They go out to the kings of the whole earth and the entire world, to gather them for the battle on the great Day of God Almighty.

(Revelation 16:16:15) 
Behold, I am coming unexpectedly, like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays alert and guards his spiritual garments, so that he may not walk around spiritually naked and his shame be seen by all.

(Revelation 16:16:16) 
And the demonic spirits gathered them together to the place which is called, in Hebrew, Armageddon.

(Revelation 16:16:17) 
Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. And a loud voice came out of the Temple, from the throne of God, saying: 'It is finished! It has happened!'

(Revelation 16:16:18) 
And there were lightning flashes, and rumblings, and thunder, and a great earthquake—such an earthquake as has never occurred since humanity has existed on the earth, so tremendous and so great.

(Revelation 16:16:19) 
And the great city split into three parts. The cities of the nations fell into ruin. And great Babylon was remembered before God, so that He might give her the cup of the wine of His fierce, righteous wrath.

(Revelation 16:16:20) 
Every island vanished, and the mountains were no longer found.

(Revelation 16:16:21) 
And a tremendous hailstorm—with hailstones weighing as much as a talent, about one hundred pounds each—fell from the sky upon the people. Yet they cursed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.

(Revelation 17:1) 
One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot, who sits enthroned over many nations and peoples."

(Revelation 17:2) 
The kings of the earth have committed spiritual adultery with her, and those who live on the earth have become drunk and misled by the wine of her spiritual corruption.

(Revelation 17:3) 
The angel carried me away in spirit into a desolate place. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, which was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.

(Revelation 17:4) 
The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of her spiritual adultery.

(Revelation 17:5) 
And upon her forehead was a name written: "A Mystery: Babylon the Great, the mother of spiritual adulteries and abominations of the earth."

(Revelation 17:6) 
And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished and filled with wonder.

(Revelation 17:7) 
And the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will tell you the hidden truth about the woman and concerning the beast that carries her, which has seven heads and ten horns."

(Revelation 17:8) 
The beast which you saw was, and is not, and will ascend from the abyss, and then go into destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast, because it was, and is not, yet is about to be present again.

(Revelation 17:9) 
Here is a profound understanding for one who possesses wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman is seated, and these also represent seven kings.

(Revelation 17:10) 
Five of these kings have fallen, one is currently reigning, and another has not yet come. And when he comes, he must remain for a short time.

(Revelation 17:11) 
And the beast that was, and is not, this very beast is also the eighth king, yet it is one of the seven, and it goes into destruction.

(Revelation 17:12) 
And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received royal power, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.

(Revelation 17:13) 
These kings share one common purpose, and they will hand over their strength and authority to the beast.

(Revelation 17:14) 
These will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because He is the Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who are with Him are the called, the chosen, and the faithful.

(Revelation 17:15) 
And he said to me: "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, they are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and languages."

(Revelation 17:16) 
And the ten horns which you saw, belonging to the beast, these kings will hate the harlot. They will make her desolate and stripped bare, they will devour her flesh, and burn her with fire.

(Revelation 17:17) 
For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His will, and to give their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.

(Revelation 17:18) 
And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which holds dominion over the kings of the earth.

(Revelation 18:1) 
And after these things, I saw another Angel descending from the sky,
who had great power.
And the entire earth was illuminated by his glorious presence.

(Revelation 18:2) 
And the Angel cried out with a strong voice, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!
She has become a dwelling place for demons,
a prison for every unclean spirit,
and a prison for every unclean and hateful bird.

(Revelation 18:3) 
This has happened because all nations have drunk of the wine of her passionate fornication.
The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,
and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.”

(Revelation 18:4) 
And I heard another voice from the sky saying:
“Come out from her, My people, all you faithful ones!
Do this so that you may not be sharers in her sins,
and so that you may not receive any of her plagues.

(Revelation 18:5) 
For her sins have reached all the way up to the sky, to the throne of God’s judgment,
and the Lord has remembered her iniquities and will act upon them.

(Revelation 18:6) 
Pay her back just as she herself has paid you, for her evil deeds.
Double her double according to her works.
In the cup which she has mixed for others, mix for her double the amount.

(Revelation 18:7) 
As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously and in pleasure,
so much give her torment and sorrow.
For in her heart she says with pride: ‘I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall see no sorrow or suffering.’

(Revelation 18:8) 
Therefore, in one single day her plagues will come upon her: death, and sorrow, and famine.
And she will be burned with fire.
This will happen because strong is the Lord God, the Almighty, who judges her.

(Revelation 18:9) 
And the kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived luxuriously will weep and mourn over her,
when they see the smoke of her burning destruction.

(Revelation 18:10) 
They will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
saying: “Woe, woe, that great city, Babylon, that strong city!
For in one hour your judgment has come!”

(Revelation 18:11) 
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her,
because no one will buy their merchandise any longer.

(Revelation 18:12) 
Their merchandise included gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls,
and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
and all fragrant thyme wood,
and all vessels made of ivory,
and all vessels made of precious stone, and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble.

(Revelation 18:13) 
Also cinnamon, and amomum (a fragrant spice), and perfumes, and ointment, and frankincense,
and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat,
and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and carriages or chariots,
and slaves, and the very souls of men.

(Revelation 18:14) 
And the fruits your soul passionately desired have departed from you.
And all your rich and splendid things have perished from you,
and they will never, ever be found again.

(Revelation 18:15) 
The merchants of these things, who grew rich from their dealings with her,
will stand far off because of the fear of her torment,
weeping and mourning.

(Revelation 18:16) 
And they will be saying: “Woe, woe, that great city,
which was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet,
and adorned with gold, and precious stone, and pearls!

(Revelation 18:17) 
For in one hour such great riches have been laid waste and brought to nothing!”
And every captain, and every passenger on ships, and sailors, and all who sail the sea,
stood far off.

(Revelation 18:18) 
And they cried out, seeing the place of her burning,
saying: “What city was ever like this great city?!”

(Revelation 18:19) 
And they threw dust upon their heads as a sign of deep mourning,
and they cried out, weeping and mourning, saying: “Woe, woe, that great city!
In her, all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth and her costly prices.
For in one single hour she has been utterly desolated!”

(Revelation 18:20) 
Rejoice over her, you inhabitants of the celestial realms, meaning angels and saints,
and you holy Apostles and Prophets!
This is because God has judged your cause against her and brought justice upon her.

(Revelation 18:21) 
And one mighty Angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone, an enormous grinding stone,
and threw it into the sea, saying: “With such violence and force shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down into oblivion,
and she shall never, ever be found again.”

(Revelation 18:22) 
And the sound of harpists, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpets will no longer be heard in you.
And no craftsman of any craft or skill will be found in you any longer.
And the sound of the millstone, for daily bread, will not be heard in you any longer.

(Revelation 18:23) 
And the light of a lamp will shine no longer in you, ending all activity.
And the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, signifying joy and new life, will not be heard in you any longer.
This judgment comes because your merchants were the great ones and rulers of the earth,
and because by your sorceries, deceptions, and spiritual manipulations, all nations were led astray into sin.

(Revelation 18:24) 
And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of all Saints,
of all who were unjustly slain on the earth through the ages.

(Revelation 19:1) 
After these events, I heard what sounded like a massive voice from countless crowds in the spiritual realm, saying: “Praise God! All salvation, all glory, and all power belong to our God.”

(Revelation 19:2) 
“Because His judgments are true and just. He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His servants from her hands.”

(Revelation 19:3) 
And again they said: “Praise God!” And the smoke of her burning ascended forever and ever.

(Revelation 19:4) 
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who was seated upon His throne, saying: “So be it! Praise God!”

(Revelation 19:5) 
And a voice came forth from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you His servants, and you who fear Him, both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:6) 
And I heard what sounded like the voice of a great crowd, and like the sound of many rushing waters, and like the sound of mighty thunderclaps, saying: “Praise God! Because the Lord our Almighty God has begun His reign.”

(Revelation 19:7) 
“Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give glory to Him. Because the Wedding Feast of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has prepared herself for it.”

(Revelation 19:8) 
And it was granted to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.

(Revelation 19:9) 
And He said to me: “Write this down: Blessed are those who are called to the Wedding Supper of the Lamb.” And He said to me: “These words are the true words of God.”

(Revelation 19:10) 
And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me: “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God alone. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy itself.”

(Revelation 19:11) 
And then I saw the spiritual realm opened, and behold, a white horse. And the One who sat upon it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice He judges and makes war.

(Revelation 19:12) 
And His eyes were like a flame of fire, and upon His head were many diadems, and He had a name written on Him which no one knows but Himself.

(Revelation 19:13) 
And He was clothed in a vestment dipped in blood, and His name is called: “The Son of God” (The Word of God).

(Revelation 19:14) 
And the armies of the spiritual realms followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

(Revelation 19:15) 
And from His mouth proceeds a sharp, two-edged sword, that with it He may strike down the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. And He Himself treads the winepress of the furious wrath of Almighty God.

(Revelation 19:16) 
And He has written on His vestment and on His thigh: “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”

(Revelation 19:17) 
And I saw a single Angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that flew through the midst of the sky: “Come, gather yourselves together for the great Supper of God.”

(Revelation 19:18) 
“So that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of tribunes, and the flesh of strong men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sat upon them, and the flesh of all free men and of servants, and of both small and great.”

(Revelation 19:19) 
And I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war against the One who sat upon the horse, and against His army.

(Revelation 19:20) 
And the Beast was captured, and with it the false prophet, who had performed signs in its presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the Beast and who had worshipped its image. These two, while still alive, were cast into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.

(Revelation 19:21) 
And the rest were slain with the sword of the One who sat upon the horse, which proceeds from His mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:1) 
Then I saw an angel coming down from the sky. He was holding the key to the bottomless pit, the Abyss, and a great chain in his hand.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:2) 
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is also called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, a symbolic period of spiritual confinement.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:3) 
The angel then threw him into the Abyss, shutting it and sealing it over him. This was so the Devil could not deceive the nations and turn them away from God until the thousand years of spiritual confinement were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:4) 
Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for proclaiming Jesus and God's word, and those who had not worshipped the Beast or its image, nor received its mark on their foreheads or hands. These souls came to life and reigned with Christ for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:5) 
The rest of the spiritually dead did not come to life in this way until the thousand years were finished. This is what is meant by the first resurrection: a spiritual reawakening and reign with Christ.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:6) 
Blessed and holy is anyone who has a part in this first resurrection, meaning a spiritual reign with Christ. Over these, the second death—eternal damnation in hell—has no power. Instead, they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with Him for this spiritual period of a thousand years.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:7) 
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his spiritual prison. He will then go out to deceive the nations throughout the whole earth—Gog and Magog, representing all who oppose God—and gather them for a final spiritual battle. Their numbers will be as countless as the sand of the sea.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:8) 
They marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, which is the Church.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:9) 
Then fire came down from God out of the sky and consumed them all. And the Devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the False Prophet had already been cast. There they will be tormented day and night for all eternity.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:10) 
Then I saw a great white throne, and One sitting on it. Before His presence, the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:11) 
I saw all the dead, both great and small, standing before the throne. Books were opened, which contained records of their lives. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their deeds, which were written in those books.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:12) 
The sea gave up the dead that were in it. And Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) gave up their dead that were in them. Every single person was judged according to what they had done in their lives.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:13) 
And Death itself and Hades (the realm of the dead) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, which is eternal damnation.

(Revelation 20:Revelation 20:14) 
If anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life, that person was cast into the lake of fire, suffering eternal damnation.

(Revelation 21:1) 
I then saw a new universe and a new earth. The old universe and the old earth had passed away, and the sea no longer existed.

(Revelation 21:2) 
And I, John, saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the sky from God. It was prepared like a bride beautifully adorned for her husband.

(Revelation 21:3) 
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with humanity, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.'

(Revelation 21:4) 
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain anymore, because the former things have passed away.

(Revelation 21:5) 
And He who sat on the throne said: 'Behold, I am making all things new.' He also said to me, 'Write, for these words are utterly trustworthy and true.'

(Revelation 21:6) 
And He said to me: 'It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end of all things. To the one who thirsts, I will give water from the fountain of life as a free gift.'

(Revelation 21:7) 
The one who overcomes will inherit these things. And I will be his God, and he will be My son.

(Revelation 21:8) 
But for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the detestable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars—their destiny will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

(Revelation 21:9) 
Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came and spoke with me, saying: 'Come, and I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.'

(Revelation 21:10) 
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending out of the sky from God.

(Revelation 21:11) 
It had the glory of God. Its radiance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.

(Revelation 21:12) 
It had a great, high wall with twelve gates. At the gates were twelve angels, and names were inscribed on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

(Revelation 21:13) 
There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.

(Revelation 21:14) 
The wall of the City also had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

(Revelation 21:15) 
The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the City, its gates, and its wall.

(Revelation 21:16) 
The City was laid out as a square, and its length was as great as its width. He measured the City with the golden rod, and it was twelve thousand stadia long. Its length, height, and width were all equal.

(Revelation 21:17) 
He also measured its wall, which was one hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure—this refers to the unit of measurement that angels use, not their physical size.

(Revelation 21:18) 
The wall was built of jasper, and the City itself was pure gold, clear as pure glass.

(Revelation 21:19) 
The foundations of the City wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

(Revelation 21:20) 
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

(Revelation 21:21) 
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made from a single pearl. And the main street of the City was pure gold, as transparent as glass.

(Revelation 21:22) 
I saw no temple within it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

(Revelation 21:23) 
The City has no need of the sun or the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its lamp.

(Revelation 21:24) 
The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory and honor into it.

(Revelation 21:25) 
Its gates will never be shut by day, because there will be no night there.

(Revelation 21:26) 
And they will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.

(Revelation 21:27) 
Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life will enter.

(Revelation 22:2) 
In the middle of the city's main street, and on both sides of the river, stood the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

(Revelation 22:3) 
And there will be no more curse or damnation. Instead, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him directly.

(Revelation 22:4) 
They will see His face directly, and His name will be visibly marked on their foreheads, showing their complete belonging to Him.

(Revelation 22:5) 
And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God Himself will enlighten them, and they will reign with Him forever and ever.

(Revelation 22:6) 
And the angel said to me: "These words are most trustworthy and true. For the Lord God, who inspires the spirits of the prophets, has sent His Angel to show His servants what must soon take place."

(Revelation 22:7) 
"And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one who truly keeps the words of the prophecy contained in this book."

(Revelation 22:8) 
And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. After I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel who had shown me these things.

(Revelation 22:9) 
And he said to me: "Do not do that! For I am a fellow servant with you, and with your brethren the prophets, and with all those who keep the words of this book. Worship God alone, for He is the only one worthy."

(Revelation 22:10) 
And he said to me: "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time for these events is near."

(Revelation 22:11) 
"Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong still, and let him who is filthy remain filthy still. But let him who is just continue to be justified still, and let him who is holy continue to be sanctified still." This means that soon, each person's spiritual state will be fixed.

(Revelation 22:12) 
"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, so that I may render to each person according to their works."

(Revelation 22:13) 
"I am the Alpha and the Omega, which means I am the First and the Last, the very Beginning and the End of all things."

(Revelation 22:14) 
Blessed are those who wash their robes in the Blood of the Lamb, so that they may have the right to eat from the tree of life and may enter into the Holy City through its gates.

(Revelation 22:15) 
Outside the Holy City are the dogs—meaning the impure and those who oppose God—along with sorcerers, the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

(Revelation 22:16) 
"I, Jesus, have sent My Angel to give you this testimony for all the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright, splendid Morning Star."

(Revelation 22:17) 
And the Holy Spirit and the Church, His Bride, say: "Come, Lord Jesus!" And let everyone who hears this also say: "Come!" Let anyone who is spiritually thirsty come, and let anyone who wills, take the water of life freely, as a gift.

(Revelation 22:18) 
For I solemnly testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone presumes to add to these revealed truths, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:19) 
And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion from the tree of life and from the Holy City, and from the blessings that are written in this book.

(Revelation 22:20) 
He who gives testimony to these things, which is Jesus Himself, says: "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!

(Revelation 22:21) 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
