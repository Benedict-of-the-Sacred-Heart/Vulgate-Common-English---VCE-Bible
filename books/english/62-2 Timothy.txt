(2 Timothy 1:1) 
Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of eternal life, which is in Christ Jesus,

(2 Timothy 1:2) 
To Timothy, my dearest son: grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.

(2 Timothy 1:3) 
I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did. I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day,

(2 Timothy 1:4) 
longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,

(2 Timothy 1:5) 
I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it lives in you as well.

(2 Timothy 1:6) 
For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

(2 Timothy 1:7) 
For God gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of self-control.

(2 Timothy 1:8) 
So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share in suffering for the Gospel according to the power of God,

(2 Timothy 1:9) 
who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of His own purpose and grace, which He gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,

(2 Timothy 1:10) 
and which now has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel,

(2 Timothy 1:11) 
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.

(2 Timothy 1:12) 
That is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.

(2 Timothy 1:13) 
Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 1:14) 
Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.

(2 Timothy 1:15) 
You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

(2 Timothy 1:16) 
May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,

(2 Timothy 1:17) 
but when he arrived in Rome, he searched for me even more eagerly until he found me.

(2 Timothy 1:18) 
May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well how many ways he served me in Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:1) 
Therefore, my son, strengthen yourself by relying on the grace that is only found in Jesus Christ.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:2) 
The truths you have heard from me, which were confirmed by many witnesses, entrust these teachings to faithful and trustworthy men who will also be capable of teaching these same truths to others.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:3) 
Work hard and endure difficulty, just like a good soldier of Christ Jesus must.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:4) 
No one who is serving as a soldier allows himself to be entangled in worldly affairs, because his main goal is to please the one who enlisted him.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:5) 
Similarly, if someone competes in an athletic contest, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the established rules.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:6) 
The hardworking farmer is the one who should be the first to receive a share of the harvest.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:7) 
Consider carefully what I am saying, because the Lord will grant you understanding in all these matters.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:8) 
Always remember that Jesus Christ Our Lord, a descendant of David, was raised from the dead. This is the central truth of the Gospel I preach.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:9) 
Because of this Gospel, I suffer hardship and am even imprisoned, as if I were a criminal. But the Word of God, which is Jesus Christ and His teachings, cannot be imprisoned.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:10) 
Because of this, I endure all these things for the sake of God's elect, so that they, too, may obtain the eternal salvation that is found in Jesus Christ, along with the glory of heaven.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:11) 
This is a trustworthy saying: If we have died with Him through baptism and penance, we will also live with Him in eternal life.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:12) 
If we persevere in suffering for Him, we will also reign with Him. But if we deny Him, He will also deny us on the day of judgment.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:13) 
Even if we are faithless, He remains faithful to His promises, for He cannot deny His own divine nature.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:14) 
Remind everyone of these truths, solemnly testifying before the Lord. Warn them not to engage in useless arguments about words, for such debates are good for nothing except leading those who listen to spiritual ruin.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:15) 
Strive diligently to present yourself to God as a worker who is approved and has no need to be ashamed, because you are accurately handling the Word of Truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:16) 
However, avoid profane and empty talk and innovative theories, for these only lead people further into ungodliness.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:17) 
Their teachings will spread like gangrene, and among these false teachers are Hymenæus and Philetus.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:18) 
These men have deviated from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and in doing so, they have undermined the faith of certain individuals.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:19) 
Nevertheless, the unshakeable foundation of God stands firm, sealed with this double inscription: 'The Lord knows those who are His,' and 'Everyone who invokes the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.'

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:20) 
In a large household, there are not only vessels made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some of these are used for honorable purposes, while others are for common or dishonorable use.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:21) 
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from such false teachings and corrupt practices, he will become a vessel set apart for honorable use, sanctified, useful to the Lord, and ready for every good work.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:22) 
Flee from youthful desires, and instead, earnestly pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, doing so with all those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:23) 
But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing full well that they only lead to quarrels.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:24) 
A servant of the Lord must not quarrel; instead, he must be gentle towards everyone, capable of teaching, and patient when wronged.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:25) 
He must humbly correct those who oppose the truth, in the hope that God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 2:2 Timothy 2:26) 
In this way, they might escape from the devil’s snare, having been captured by him to do his will.

(2 Timothy 3:1) 
But understand this truth: in the final days of history, perilous times will be upon us.

(2 Timothy 3:2) 
For at that time, people will be consumed with love for themselves, obsessed with money, filled with pride and arrogance, blasphemers, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful for blessings, and entirely unholy.

(2 Timothy 3:3) 
They will lack natural affection, be unforgiving, eager to accuse falsely, without self-control, brutal, and without any love for what is good.

(2 Timothy 3:4) 
They will be betrayers, recklessly defiant, puffed up with self-importance, and will love worldly pleasures more than they love God.

(2 Timothy 3:5) 
They will maintain an outward appearance of piety, but they will deny the true power and virtue of it in their lives. You must turn away from such people.

(2 Timothy 3:6) 
For among these sorts of people are those who slyly infiltrate private homes, leading astray impressionable women who are burdened by their sins and easily swayed by various worldly desires.

(2 Timothy 3:7) 
These women are always learning, yet they never come to a full and certain knowledge of the truth.

(2 Timothy 3:8) 
Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses with their magic, so do these false teachers resist the divine truth. They are men with corrupted minds, whose faith has been rejected and found wanting.

(2 Timothy 3:9) 
But they will not make any further progress, because their foolishness will become obvious to everyone, just as the foolishness of Jannes and Jambres was made manifest.

(2 Timothy 3:10) 
But you, Timothy, have thoroughly observed and followed my teaching, my manner of life, my true purpose, my faith, my patience with others, my love for all, and my perseverance through suffering.

(2 Timothy 3:11) 
You have also seen my persecutions and sufferings—what I went through in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what intense persecutions I endured, yet out of all of them, the Lord truly delivered me.

(2 Timothy 3:12) 
In fact, everyone who truly desires to live a life of piety united with Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

(2 Timothy 3:13) 
But wicked people and deceivers will only continue to grow worse, always going astray themselves and leading others into error.

(2 Timothy 3:14) 
But you, Timothy, must continue steadfastly in the truths you have learned and which have been entrusted to you, knowing the trustworthy teachers from whom you received them.

(2 Timothy 3:15) 
And know that from your very childhood, you have been familiar with the sacred Scriptures, which possess the power to instruct you unto salvation, through the active faith that you have in Christ Jesus.

(2 Timothy 3:16) 
All of Sacred Scripture is inspired by God's own breath; therefore, it is profitable for teaching sound doctrine, for convicting the conscience, for correcting sinful behavior, and for training in all righteousness.

(2 Timothy 3:17) 
This is so that the man consecrated to God may be fully complete and perfectly equipped for every good work.

(2 Timothy 4:1) 
I solemnly charge you before God the Father, and Christ Jesus, who will judge both the living and the dead by His Second Coming and His Eternal Reign.

(2 Timothy 4:2) 
Preach the true word of God. Be ready and urgent in season and out of season. Correct those who err, entreat the wavering, and rebuke the obstinate, doing all of this with great patience and careful teaching.

(2 Timothy 4:3) 
For there will come a time when people will no longer tolerate sound doctrine. Instead, they will gather teachers for themselves who cater to their own desires, because they have itching ears, desiring only what they want to hear.

(2 Timothy 4:4) 
They will turn away from truly hearing the truth, and will instead turn to fables and myths.

(2 Timothy 4:5) 
But you, for your part, stay watchful in all things. Endure hardships. Perform the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry completely.

(2 Timothy 4:6) 
For I am already being poured out like a libation in sacrifice, and the time for my departure from this life is at hand.

(2 Timothy 4:7) 
I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the Catholic Faith.

(2 Timothy 4:8) 
From now on, the crown of justice is reserved for me, which the Lord, the just Judge, will give to me on that Day of Judgment. This crown is not for me alone, but also for all those who love His coming.

(2 Timothy 4:9) 
Make every effort to come to me quickly.

(2 Timothy 4:10) 
For Demas has abandoned me because he loved this present world, and he has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.

(2 Timothy 4:11) 
Luke is the only one with me now. Take Mark with you and bring him along, for he is very useful to me in ministry.

(2 Timothy 4:12) 
However, I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

(2 Timothy 4:13) 
When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas. Also bring the books, and especially the parchments.

(2 Timothy 4:14) 
Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me great harm. May the Lord repay him according to his deeds.

(2 Timothy 4:15) 
You also must avoid him, for he strongly opposed our message.

(2 Timothy 4:16) 
At my first defense in court, no one stood with me, but everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.

(2 Timothy 4:17) 
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching of the Gospel might be fully accomplished, and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the mouth of the lion.

(2 Timothy 4:18) 
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

(2 Timothy 4:19) 
Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.

(2 Timothy 4:20) 
Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

(2 Timothy 4:21) 
Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.

(2 Timothy 4:22) 
May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May grace be with you all. Amen.
